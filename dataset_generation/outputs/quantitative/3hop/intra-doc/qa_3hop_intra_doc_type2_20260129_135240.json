      "question": "How did the $5.8 billion opioid litigation charges recorded in 2022 impact CVS's operating income trends, segment-level expense allocations, and the company's adjusted operating loss reconciliation in 2023?",
      "answer": "The $5.8 billion opioid litigation charges recorded in 2022 had a significant impact on CVS's financial performance and reporting across multiple dimensions. In 2022, these charges were a major contributor to the operating income decline, as noted in the year-over-year commentary where the absence of these charges in 2023 was cited as the primary reason for a 72.8% increase in operating income. These charges were specifically allocated to the Corporate/Other segment, increasing its operating loss under GAAP measures. However, in the adjusted operating loss reconciliation, which excludes certain non-recurring or strategic charges, the $5.8 billion opioid litigation charges were removed, contributing to an 18.3% decrease in adjusted operating loss in 2023 compared to 2022. This illustrates how the charges distorted both GAAP profitability metrics and segment-level performance analysis, necessitating their exclusion to better reflect underlying business trends.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVS](page_196) \u2192 [Opioid Litigation Charges]: The charges are explicitly mentioned as part of the Corporate/Other segment's operating expenses in 2022, indicating their GAAP recognition and segment-level impact.",
        "Hop 2: [CVS](page_80) \u2192 [Opioid Litigation Charges]: The charges are referenced as a key driver behind the year-over-year change in operating income, specifically highlighting their absence in 2023 as a major factor in the 72.8% increase in operating income.",
        "Hop 3: [CVS](page_94) \u2192 [Opioid Litigation Charges]: The charges are referenced in the Corporate/Other segment commentary as a $5.8 billion expense in 2022, and their removal is shown to meaningfully improve the adjusted operating loss metric by 18.3% in 2023."

      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment faces significant exposure to adverse selection and economic volatility, particularly in its Public Exchange products where pricing accuracy is impacted by factors like health status of members and potential expiration of premium subsidies (page_48). These risks are compounded by broader economic pressures such as inflation and workforce reductions, which can increase medical cost trends and reduce enrollment, further straining profitability (page_44). Amid these challenges, the segment recorded a $225 million pre-tax gain from divestitures, including the exit from its Thailand business and international renewal rights, signaling a strategic retreat from certain markets (page_146). Additionally, the company incurred $507 million in restructuring charges in 2023, reflecting efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs in response to these pressures. This combination of external risk exposure and internal restructuring indicates a strategic recalibration to mitigate financial risks and stabilize the segment's performance in a volatile environment.",

      "question": "How does the regulatory pressure on minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements across commercial and Medicare lines of business affect CVS's ability to maintain profitability, especially in light of potential CMS contract terminations and state-level premium rate restrictions?",
      "answer": "CVS faces significant regulatory constraints on its ability to price risk appropriately due to minimum MLR requirements under the ACA and CMS regulations. On the commercial side, the ACA mandates minimum MLRs of 85% for large group and 80% for individual/small group products, with some states imposing even stricter thresholds. These requirements limit the margin CVS can earn while exposing it to medical costs that may exceed projections. In the Medicare business, CMS requires an 85% MLR for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, and if a contract pays rebates for three consecutive years, it becomes ineligible for new enrollments, and termination follows after five years. This creates a dual challenge: on one hand, premium rate increases are often necessary to cover rising medical costs and assessments, but on the other, regulatory scrutiny and public disclosure requirements may delay or deny those increases. The combination of these pressures across both commercial and Medicare lines heightens the risk of margin compression and could lead to withdrawal from certain geographies or product lines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [CVS](page_37) \u2192 [Medical Benefit Ratios]: The ACA imposes minimum MLRs of 85% for large group and 80% for individual/small group commercial products, with potential state-level enhancements, limiting CVS's pricing flexibility and exposing it to unanticipated medical cost overruns.",
        "Hop 2: [CVS](page_59) \u2192 [Medical Benefit Ratios]: CMS mandates an 85% MLR for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, with the risk of enrollment restrictions and contract termination after three and five consecutive years of rebate payments, respectively, creating a structural profitability risk.",
        "Hop 3: [CVS](page_25) \u2192 [Medical Benefit Ratios]: CVS notes that ACA provisions and CMS regulations significantly impact its Medicare business, particularly with the risk of CMS contract termination for repeated MLR rebate payments, and anticipates regulatory and policy changes that could affect reimbursement and benefit design."

      "question": "How does CVS's actuarial estimation methodology for Health Care Costs Payable, particularly regarding IBNR reserves, align with the auditor's evaluation of the liability's uncertainty and the potential material impact of changes in completion factors and healthcare cost trend rates?",
      "answer": "CVS utilizes actuarial principles and assumptions such as completion factors and healthcare cost trend rates to estimate IBNR reserves, which represent a significant portion of Health Care Costs Payable (page 125). The auditor from Ernst & Young LLP emphasized the high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty in estimating these IBNR reserves, particularly due to sensitivity to assumptions like completion factors and cost trend rates (page 200). Additionally, page 126 highlights that changes in these assumptions could materially affect the estimates, and the company acknowledges that actual claim payments may differ from its estimates, reinforcing the auditor's concerns about the liability's volatility.",

      "answer": "The 'Other operating segment' shows a significant decline in total assets from $1,337 million in 2023 to $547 million in 2024, indicating a reduction in its asset base or strategic focus. Its operating profit also shifted from a loss of $89 million in 2023 to a small profit of $10 million in 2024, suggesting improved operational efficiency or a strategic pivot. Meanwhile, its net sales contribution dropped from $495 million in 2023 to $221 million in 2024, pointing to a deliberate downsizing or divestiture of business lines.

      "answer": "The financial impact of acquisition and divestiture-related items on Medtronic's net income has increased significantly from fiscal year 2022 to 2024. In fiscal 2022, these items reduced net income by $838 million, in fiscal 2023 by $345 million, and in fiscal 2024 by $777 million. This fluctuation suggests that while the company continued to engage in strategic acquisitions and divestitures, the financial impact was not consistently decreasing, indicating ongoing integration efforts and potential complexities in realizing synergies.",

      "question": "How has the impact of restructuring and associated costs on Medtronic's financial performance evolved across recent fiscal years, particularly when comparing GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings metrics?",
      "answer": "Medtronic's restructuring and associated costs have declined from $647 million in fiscal 2023 to $389 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a reduction in restructuring activity. These costs directly reduced GAAP income before income taxes in both years, with a larger impact in 2023. However, when adjusted for Non-GAAP purposes, these costs were added back, contributing to higher Non-GAAP earnings per share\u2014by $0.38 in 2023 and $0.24 in 2024. This shows that while restructuring expenses remain a material item affecting GAAP results, their removal significantly enhances the perception of financial performance under Non-GAAP reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MDT](page_104) \u2192 [Restructuring and associated costs]: Restructuring and associated costs are listed as $389 million in fiscal 2024, down from $647 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a year-over-year decline in restructuring activity.",
        "Hop 2: [MDT](page_34) \u2192 [Restructuring and associated costs]: In fiscal 2023, restructuring and associated costs of $647 million were included as a non-GAAP adjustment, contributing $0.38 to the difference between GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS, showing their material impact on earnings normalization.",
        "Hop 3: [MDT](page_33) \u2192 [Restructuring and associated costs]: In fiscal 2024, restructuring and associated costs of $389 million were again added back in non-GAAP adjustments, contributing $0.24 to the non-GAAP EPS, demonstrating continued influence on earnings presentation despite reduced spending."

On page 33, the 2022 fiscal year shows a similar pattern, with $95 million added back to income before taxes, resulting in a $17 million tax impact and $78 million contribution to net income.

      "answer": "Medtronic reported restructuring and associated costs of $335 million in fiscal 2022, $617 million in fiscal 2021, and $441 million in fiscal 2020 within its operating performance. These costs were also reflected in the tax adjustments, where the tax benefit associated with these costs decreased from $128 million in 2021 to $54 million in 2022, indicating a lower tax shield in the latter year. In the non-GAAP reconciliation, the company adjusted these costs to present a normalized earnings picture, showing that excluding these charges significantly increased income before taxes (from $5,517M to $8,609M in 2022 and from $3,895M to $6,804M in 2021). This suggests that while restructuring costs are substantial and recurring, Medtronic frames them as non-core to its ongoing operational performance, using non-GAAP metrics to emphasize underlying profitability trends.",

      "question": "How does the growth trajectory of Medtronic's Cranial & Spinal Technologies division compare to its broader Neuroscience portfolio and overall company performance, and what does this suggest about its strategic positioning within the company's surgical innovation focus?",
      "answer": "Cranial & Spinal Technologies reported $4,456 million in net sales in 2022, reflecting a 4% increase from 2021, which is lower than the 7% growth seen in the broader Neuroscience portfolio and the 5% growth of the total company. This suggests that while Cranial & Spinal Technologies remains a significant contributor to the Neuroscience segment, its growth lags behind both its internal peers and the company-wide average. The division's strategic positioning appears strong due to its advanced technologies like the Mazor X robotic guidance system and the StealthStation S8 Navigation System, which support minimally invasive procedures and are aligned with the company's surgical innovation focus, even though its recent growth has been moderate.",

      "question": "How does Medical Surgical's contribution to Medtronic's total revenue growth in 2022 compare with its asset base and capital efficiency relative to other business segments?",
      "answer": "Medical Surgical contributed $9.141 billion in net sales in 2022, representing a 5% increase from $8.737 billion in 2021, which aligns with the overall 5% revenue growth for Medtronic. However, the segment carried the largest asset base at $36.940 billion as of April 29, 2022, significantly higher than the next largest segment, Neuroscience, at $16.917 billion. Despite its large asset footprint, Medical Surgical had relatively modest depreciation expense of $200 million in 2022, suggesting a potentially more capital-efficient segment compared to others like Cardiovascular, which had a larger depreciation expense despite a smaller asset base. This indicates that while Medical Surgical drives substantial revenue, it does so with a disproportionately large asset allocation, raising questions about the efficiency and strategic balance of capital deployment across segments.",

      "answer": "Merck estimates a total of $3.5 billion in pretax restructuring costs, with approximately 70% ($2.45 billion) expected to be cash outlays primarily related to employee separation and facility shut-down costs, and 30% ($1.05 billion) as non-cash charges from accelerated depreciation. The detailed breakdown in the restructuring note shows that facility shut-down costs are part of the cash component and are included in the $868 million recorded in 2021, $880 million in 2020, and $915 million in 2019. These restructuring charges, including facility shut-down costs, are excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS, aligning with the company's policy to adjust for restructuring-related costs such as employee separation and accelerated depreciation. This treatment ensures that the impact of facility closures does not distort ongoing operational performance metrics.",

Restructuring\n\nIn  2019,  Merck  approved  a  global  restructuring  program  (Restructuring  Program)  as  part  of  a  worldwide  initiative focused  on  further  optimizing  the  Company's  manufacturing  and  supply  network,  as  well  as  reducing  its  global  real  estate footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pretax costs will result in cash outlays, primarily related to employee separation expense and facility shut-down costs. Approximately 30% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested.\n\nThe Company recorded total pretax  costs  of  $868  million  in  2021,  $880  million  in  2020  and  $915  million  in  2019 related to restructuring program activities. Since inception of the Restructuring Program through December 31, 2021, Merck has recorded total pretax accumulated costs of approximately $2.7 billion. The Company expects to record charges of approximately $400 million in 2022 related to the Restructuring Program. For segment reporting, restructuring charges are unallocated expenses.",

      "answer": "Merck's discussion of the Healthcare Services segment across three sections reveals a consistent narrative of strategic divestiture and financial repositioning. In the business description (page_51), the segment is noted as fully divested by Q1 2020, aligning with the company's refocus on core pharmaceutical and animal health businesses. Revenue reporting (page_141) confirms this by labeling the segment as fully divested and showing its residual financial impact as a separate category. Impairment disclosures (page_135) further reinforce this timeline by noting a $162 million goodwill impairment charge in 2019 tied to the same segment, signaling early recognition of declining value prior to the exit. Together, these perspectives illustrate a deliberate strategic shift supported by both operational and financial actions.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n## Description of Merck's Business\n\nMerck &amp; Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through  its  prescription  medicines,  vaccines,  biologic  therapies  and  animal  health  products.  The  Company's  operations  are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, which are the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments, both of which are reportable segments.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.\n\nThe Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.\n\nThe  Company  previously  had  a  Healthcare  Services  segment  that  provided  services  and  solutions  focused  on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients. The Company divested the remaining businesses in this segment during the first quarter of 2020.\n\n## Spin-Off of Organon &amp; Co.\n\nOn June 2, 2021, Merck completed the spin-off of products from its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company named Organon &amp; Co. (Organon) through a distribution of Organon's publicly  traded  stock  to  Company  shareholders.  The  distribution  is  expected  to  qualify  and  has  been  treated  as  tax-free  to  the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of Merck's diversified brands franchise. Merck's existing research pipeline programs continue to be owned and developed within Merck as planned. The historical results of the businesses that were contributed to Organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  through  the  date  of  the  spin-off  (see  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial statements).",

Financial Instruments\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\n\nA significant  portion  of  the  Company's  revenues  and  earnings  in  foreign  affiliates  is  exposed  to  changes  in  foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on  assessments  of  cost-benefit  profiles  that  consider  natural  offsetting  exposures,  revenue  and  exchange  rate  volatilities  and correlations,  and  the  cost  of  hedging  instruments.  The  Company  manages  its  anticipated  transaction  exposure  principally  with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\n\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or OCI depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in AOCL and reclassified into Sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe  Company  manages  operating  activities  and  net  asset  positions  at  each  local  subsidiary  in  order  to  mitigate  the effects  of  exchange  on  monetary  assets  and  liabilities.  The  Company  also  uses  a  balance  sheet  risk  management  program  to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. For exposures in developing country currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, the Company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in Other (income) expense, net . The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through Other (income) expense, net . Accordingly,  fair  value  changes  in  the  forward  contracts  help  mitigate  the  changes  in  the  value  of  the  remeasured  assets  and liabilities  attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than one year.",

The Company purchased $1.3 billion and $4.8 billion of its common stock during 2020 and 2019, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs.\n\n## Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures\n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\n\nA significant  portion  of  the  Company's  revenues  and  earnings  in  foreign  affiliates  is  exposed  to  changes  in  foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on  assessments  of  cost-benefit  profiles  that  consider  natural  offsetting  exposures,  revenue  and  exchange  rate  volatilities  and correlations,  and  the  cost  of  hedging  instruments.  The  Company  manages  its  anticipated  transaction  exposure  principally  with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\n\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( OCI) ,  depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these  contracts  are  recorded  in Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss ( AOCL) and  reclassified  into Sales when  the  hedged anticipated  revenue  is  recognized.  For  those  derivatives  which  are  not  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  but  serve  as  economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nBecause Merck principally  sells  foreign  currency  in  its  revenue  hedging  program,  a  uniform  weakening  of  the  U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $648 million and $593 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe  Company  manages  operating  activities  and  net  asset  positions  at  each  local  subsidiary  in  order  to  mitigate  the effects  of  exchange  on  monetary  assets  and  liabilities.

      "answer": "In 2021, Merck incurred $868 million in aggregate pretax restructuring costs, which included asset abandonment and facility shut-down expenses. These costs, which also encompassed employee separation and pension-related charges, were excluded from non-GAAP income and EPS as part of restructuring actions. Despite these upfront charges, the company anticipated that its restructuring program would yield annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of 2023, indicating a strategic trade-off between short-term costs and long-term financial benefits.",

These items are adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. Typically, these consist of items that are unusual in nature,  significant  to  the  results  of  a  particular  period  or  not  indicative  of  future  operating  results.  Excluded  from  non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are charges for the acquisitions of Pandion, VelosBio, OncoImmune and Peloton, as well as charges related to collaborations, including transactions with Seagen (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Also excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are charges related to the discontinuation of COVID-19 development programs (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, excluded from non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are certain tax items, including net tax benefits related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, an adjustment to tax benefits recorded  in  conjunction  with  the  2015  acquisition  of  Cubist  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.,  a  tax  benefit  related  to  the  reversal  of  tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of MCC, and a net tax charge related to the finalization of U.S. treasury regulations related to the TCJA (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Research and Development\n\n## Research Pipeline\n\nThe Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the U.S. and internationally, as well as in latestage  clinical  development.

Certain recent transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Merck actively monitors the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company's strategic criteria.\n\nIn  March  2021,  Merck  and  Gilead  entered  into  an  agreement  to  jointly  develop  and  commercialize  long-acting treatments  in  HIV  that  combine  Merck's  investigational  NRTTI,  islatravir,  and  Gilead's  investigational  capsid  inhibitor, lenacapavir. The collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral formulations and long-acting injectable formulations of these combination products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. There was no upfront payment made by either party upon entering into the agreement.\n\nIn April 2021, Merck acquired Pandion, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to  address  the  unmet  needs  of  patients  living  with  autoimmune  diseases,  for  total  consideration  of  $1.9  billion.  Pandion  is advancing a pipeline of precision immune modulators targeting critical immune control nodes.\n\nIn November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron, a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion. Acceleron is evaluating the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins that is known to play a central role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and repair.

      "answer": "Amgen operates exclusively in the human therapeutics segment, which serves as the sole operating and reportable segment. This structure aligns with the company's strategic focus on innovative medicines like MariTide, IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, and TEPEZZA, which are positioned to address high unmet medical needs and drive future revenue growth. However, the company is also preparing for new accounting standards (ASU No. 2024-03 and others), which will require more detailed disclosures on income taxes and expense disaggregation, including depreciation, compensation, and inventory purchases. These standards will affect how Amgen reports its consolidated financial performance, which is currently based on net income and total assets, and could influence how investors and analysts interpret the profitability and efficiency of its human therapeutics segment. The consolidated revenue reporting by product and geography further underscores the need for clearer expense alignment under the new standards to better reflect the financial performance of the company\u2019s strategic initiatives.",

(including its subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines  to  fight  some  of  the  world's  toughest  diseases.  We  focus  on  areas  of  high  unmet  medical  need  and  leverage  our  ex pertise  to  strive  for  solutions  that dramatically improve people's lives, while also reducing the social and economic burden of disease. We helped launch the biotechnology industry more than 40 years ago and have grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies. Our robust pipeline includes potential first-in-class medicines at all stages of development. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide.\n\nAmgen was incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. Amgen operates in one operating segment: human therapeutics.\n\n## Significant Developments\n\nFollowing is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Products/Pipeline\n\n## Maridebart cafraglutide\n\nIn November 2024, we announced positive data at 52 weeks in part 1 of a double-blind, dose-ranging Phase 2 study with MariTide, a differentiated peptide-antibody conjugate subcutaneously administered monthly or less frequently. In people living with obesity or overweight without type 2 diabetes, MariTide demonstrated up to approximately 20% average weight loss at week 52 without a weight loss plateau. The study also showed people living with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes achieved up to approximately 17% average weight loss without a weight loss plateau and lowered their average hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) by up to 2.2 percentage points at week 52. MariTide also demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, including blood pressure, triglycerides and highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) across doses.\n\nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in part 1 of the  Phase 2 study were gastrointestinal  (GI)  related,  including  nausea,  vomiting  and  constipation.  The incidence of nausea and vomiting was substantially reduced with dose escalation. The discontinuation rate in the dose escalation arms due to any AE was approximately 11% and less than 8% for GI-related AEs.\n\n## IMDELLTRA\n\nIn May 2024, we announced IMDELL TRA received accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n## BLINCYTO\n\nIn  June 2024, we announced BLINCYTO received approval from the FDA in frontline consolidation for patients with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosomenegative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n\nIn December 2024, we announced new data from a Phase 3 trial demonstrating that adding BLINCYTO to chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard risk (SR) B-ALL of average or higher risk of relapse. The study met its primary endpoint  of  DFS.  Overall,  the  3-year  DFS  was  96.0%  for  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  plus  BLINCYTO  compared  to  87.9%  for  those  treated  with  only chemotherapy. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.64], indicating a 61% reduction in the risk of disease relapse, secondary malignant neoplasm or remission death with BLINCYTO. At three years, more patients remained alive and cancer free when treated with BLINCYTO plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of BLINCYTO.\n\n## TEPEZZA\n\nIn September 2024, we announced TEPEZZA was approved for the treatment of active or high clinical activity score (CAS) thyroid eye disease (TED) in Japan.",

(including its subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative medicines  to  fight  some  of  the  world's  toughest  diseases.  We  focus  on  areas  of  high  unmet  medical  need  and  leverage  our  ex pertise  to  strive  for  solutions  that dramatically improve people's lives, while also reducing the social and economic burden of disease. We helped launch the biotechnology industry more than 40 years ago and have grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies. Our robust pipeline includes potential first-in-class medicines at all stages of development.\n\nOur principal products are Prolia, ENBREL, XGEV A, Repatha, Otezla, TEPEZZA, EVENITY , KYPROLIS, Nplate, Aranesp, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA, V ectibix and TEZSPIRE.  We  also  market  a  number  of  other  products,  including  but  not  limited  to AMJEVITA/AMGEVITA,  MV ASI,  Neulasta,  RAVICTI,  UPLIZNA,  Parsabiv, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Aimovig, TAVNEOS, PROCYSBI, EPOGEN and IMDELLTRA. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. BusinessMarketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\n\nOur strategy is the integrated set of actions we take to improve our competitive position in the industry. In 2024, we advanced our innovative pipeline; generated strong  sales  growth  across  our  product  portfolio  and  regions;  and  ex panded  our  world-class  manufacturing  network.  We  accomplished  these  objectives  while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nWe received regulatory approvals for BLINCYTO in CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL and IMDELL TRA in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and reported five Phase 3 data readouts, including for BLINCYTO, UPLIZNA, rocatinlimab and TEZSPIRE, as well as MariTide Phase 2 top-line results. For more information on our pipeline and clinical development updates, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates, and Part I, Item 1. Business-Significant Developments.\n\nTotal product sales increased in 2024, primarily driven by volume growth of 23%, partially offset by declines in net selling price of 2%. Product sales from acquired Horizon products contributed $4.2 billion in 2024 compared to $954 million in 2023, with volume growth from our other brands of 11%.\n\nCash flows from operating activities in 2024 totaled $11.5 billion, which supported investment in our business, including capital expenditures of $1.1 billion to enhance and expand our manufacturing network, and allowed us to both reduce our debt outstanding and return capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. For 2024, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $2.25 per share of common stock. In December 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of",

The estimated fair value of $3.5 billion was determined by using a multi-period ex cess earnings income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value by applying a discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The developed-product-technology rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 11 years from the acquisition date using the straight-line methodology.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired inventory of $41 million was determined using the comparative sales method, which uses actual or expected selling prices of inventory as the base amount to which adjustments for selling effort and a profit on the buyer's effort are applied. The inventory fair value adjustment was amortized as inventory turned over, which we estimated to be approximately 13 months from the acquisition date.\n\nA net deferred tax liability of $502 million was recognized on the temporary differences related to the book bases and tax bases of the acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities, primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired.\n\nThe excess of the acquisition date consideration over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of $649 million was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill value is primarily attributable to the ex pected synergies from the TAVNEOS asset.\n\n## Divestiture of Gensenta \u0130la\u00e7 Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, we sold our shares in G ensenta, a subsidiary in Turkey, to Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 for net cash proceeds of approximately $130 million. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of a business and did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. Upon closing of this transaction, net assets related to Gensenta of $86 million were divested, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on divestiture of $567 million recorded in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily due to the reclassification of $615 million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses from AOCI into earnings.

      "answer": "Amgen's accumulated deficit increased from $26.55 billion in 2023 to $27.59 billion in 2024, primarily due to significant stock repurchases and dividend payments, such as the $4.93 billion in dividends and $200 million in stock repurchases in 2024. Despite this growing deficit, Amgen maintains a strong capital allocation strategy that includes returning value to shareholders through consistent dividend increases and repurchases, while still preserving a robust balance sheet with $12.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company explicitly states that this deficit is not expected to hinder its ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay debt due to its continued profitability and financial strength.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents was $12.0 billion on December 31, 2024. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nConsistent  with  the  objective  to  optimize  our  capital  structure,  we  deploy  our  accumulated  cash  balances  in  a  strategic  manner  and  consider  a  number  of alternatives, including investments in innovation both internally and externally (including investments that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), capital ex penditures, repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases.\n\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while reducing our debt and returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. This reflects our desire to optimize our cost of capital and our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, debt levels and debt service requirements, our credit rating, availability of financing on acceptable terms, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company's agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, ASRs and market transactions.\n\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $2.25, $2.13 and $1.94 per share of common stock paid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 6% and 10% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. In December 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $2.38 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 6% over the same period in the prior year, to be paid in March 2025.\n\nWe also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2024, we repurchased $200 million of common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2023, we did not repurchase any of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2022, we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock, including $6.0 billion under ASR agreements and had cash settlements for stock repurchases of $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $6.8 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.\n\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.",

      "question": "How does Amgen's net interest expense of $2,875 million in 2023 reconcile across its income statement presentation, operating income reconciliation, and segment reporting, and what does this reveal about its financial structure and cost of capital?",
      "answer": "Amgen's net interest expense of $2,875 million in 2023 appears consistently across its financial reporting but is framed differently depending on the section. In the Consolidated Statements of Income (page_150), it is presented as a direct expense of $2,875 million, separate from other income/expense items like hedging gains or losses. In the operating income reconciliation (page_107), this expense is subtracted from operating income to arrive at income before taxes, highlighting its impact on pre-tax earnings. In the segment reporting (page_118), the same $2,875 million is listed as a standalone item after segment net income, showing it as a corporate-level cost not allocated to operating segments. This consistent quantification but differing presentation reveals that interest expense is a significant, centrally managed cost tied to corporate financing decisions, rather than operational performance, and directly affects consolidated net income despite stable segment-level profitability.",

      "question": "How does AbbVie's strategic positioning of Humira in its core immunology portfolio reconcile with the significant year-over-year sales decline in both U.S. and international markets, and how does this impact the overall revenue composition of the company?",
      "answer": "AbbVie positions Humira as a foundational product in its immunology portfolio, highlighting its broad approvals across autoimmune diseases. However, the drug's global sales declined by 37% in 2024, with a 41% drop in the U.S. and a 13% decline internationally, primarily due to biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in early 2023. This sharp decline is evident in both the detailed revenue tables and the narrative MD&A section. Despite this, AbbVie continues to emphasize its diversified business model, allowing it to absorb the impact through strong growth in other immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which grew by 51% and 53%, respectively. This strategic balance suggests that while Humira remains a named pillar of the portfolio, its financial contribution is rapidly diminishing, shifting AbbVie's revenue base toward newer therapies.",

In the United States, Humira sales decreased 41% in 2024 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition following loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2024 primarily driven by the continued impact of direct biosimilar competition.\n\nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 51% in 2024 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth across all indications.\n\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased 53% in 2024 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth across all indications.\n\nNet revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased 7% in 2024 primarily driven by decreased demand and lower market share in the United States as well as decreased collaboration revenues.\n\nNet revenues for Venclexta increased 16% in 2024 primarily driven by continued market share uptake and market growth across all indications.\n\nNet revenues for Elahere were $479 million in 2024 for the period subsequent to the completion of the ImmunoGen acquisition.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "answer": "AbbVie's $3.24 billion 'Other Expense, Net' in 2024 includes a $82 million charge from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, which are calculated using unobservable inputs like discount rates and milestone probabilities. This expense appears both in the consolidated earnings statement (as part of the consolidated earnings summary) and is further detailed in the fair value discussion, showing that acquisition-related uncertainties significantly influence financial obligations and can materially impact results. The alignment across these sections indicates that AbbVie\u2019s financial performance is meaningfully affected by forward-looking assumptions tied to its acquisition strategy.",

The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and included a charge of $82 million in 2024. The change in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive loss and was not significant.\n\nThe fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.\n\nThe fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:\n\n",

      "answer": "AbbVie reported net investment hedging gains of $484 million in 2024, $555 million in 2022, and a loss of $399 million in 2023, which offset foreign currency translation losses of $1.0 billion in 2024 and $943 million in 2022, while partially offsetting translation gains of $407 million in 2023. These hedging impacts are further detailed in the reclassification table, where 2024 shows no derivative gains excluded from effectiveness testing, contrasting with $123 million and $112 million losses in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tax effects also varied, with tax expense related to net investment hedging activities amounting to $133 million in 2024, $(109) million in 2023, and $152 million in 2022, aligning with the reclassification tax impacts of $27 million, $24 million, and $20 million over the same years. This indicates that the company\u2019s hedging strategy had a material effect on mitigating foreign exchange volatility, particularly during periods of significant Euro depreciation.",

The losses from the cross-currency swap were reclassified to net foreign exchange loss over the term of the related debt, while the foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedges were recorded at fair value with gains or losses reflected directly in net foreign exchange loss.

These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2024 are reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.\n\nIn 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash fl ows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was included in AOCI. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt.\n\nThe company was a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges that matured in November 2022. The effect of the hedge contracts was to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses were included in AOCI and reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.\n\nIn June 2023, the company entered into a cross-currency swap contract that matured in November 2023 with a notional amount totaling \u20ac433 million to hedge the company's exposure to changes in future cash flows of foreign currency denominated debt related to changes in foreign exchange rates. The crosscurrency swap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converted the interest and principal payments of the related foreign currency denominated debt to U.S. dollars. The unrealized gains and losses on the contract were included in AOCI and reclassified to net foreign exchange loss over the term of the related debt.\n\nThe company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated debt, trade payables, receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gains or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $5.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of \u20ac3.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and \u20ac5.4 billion December 31, 2023. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling \u20ac6.2 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD500 million and CHF50 million at December 31, 2024 and \u20ac4.9 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD750 million and CHF50 million at December 31, 2023. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\n\nNo amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.",

      "question": "How does AbbVie's treatment of the timing of milestone achievement in its contingent consideration liabilities relate to its valuation of in-process R&D assets and its impairment testing methodology, particularly considering the $8.1 billion IPR&D figure and the $82 million 2024 charge?",
      "answer": "AbbVie uses consistent probability-weighted models and Monte Carlo simulations across both contingent consideration liabilities and intangible asset valuations to estimate the timing and likelihood of milestone achievement. The $8.1 billion IPR&D valuation incorporates timing of regulatory and commercial milestones as key unobservable inputs, similar to the $82 million charge in 2024 that reflects changes in these estimates. This aligns with AbbVie's impairment testing methodology where timing of cash flows and milestone achievement are critical assumptions in determining the fair value of intangible assets, highlighting how changes in expected timing directly impact both asset valuations and liability measurements.",

IPR&amp;D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.\n\nAbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an i mpairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nAnnually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the i ndustry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is l es s  than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.\n\nFor its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, i ncluding the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful l i fe. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\n\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie consists of $345 million aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $400 million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\n\nLong-term debt assumed by AbbVie relates to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $246 million as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the financing liability was determined using a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Assumptions inherent in the development of fair value include discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. See Note 10 and Note 11 for additional information.\n\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics represents expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie's neuroscience pipeline, (ii) leverage AbbVie's commercial, regulatory and clinical expertise to maximize Cerevel Therapeutic's assets and (iii) enhance AbbVie's existing neuroscience discovery capabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "answer": "The 39% decline in Gilead's royalty, contract, and other revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher milestone payments received in 2022 and lower royalty revenues in 2023, driven by the impact of generic launches. Despite this significant drop in royalty and contract revenues, total revenues remained relatively stable year-over-year\u2014$27.1 billion in 2023 versus $27.3 billion in 2022\u2014due to offsetting growth in product sales, particularly in HIV and oncology segments. Regionally, while U.S. and Europe saw declines in royalty revenues from $168 million to $62 million and $127 million to $114 million respectively, these were not enough to offset the overall revenue trends driven by product performance.",

      "answer": "Gilead's treatment of intangible assets reflects a dual dynamic: strategic investments in in-licensed products like the $550 million intangible asset from Japan Tobacco (amortized over 9 years) and Everest's $175 million asset for Trodelvy rights, contrasted with significant financial write-offs such as the $406 million expense from terminating the Everest agreement, the $70 million and $41 million charges from waiving options to acquire Pionyr and Tizona, and the $51 million write-off of the Galapagos intangible asset. Additionally, the reclassification of the $6.1 billion IPR&D asset for Trodelvy upon FDA approval and the $50 million impairment of bulevirtide's IPR&D asset further illustrate how Gilead adjusts its intangible asset valuations based on regulatory outcomes and strategic shifts.",

      "answer": "Gilead's approach to sharing commercialization costs varies significantly across its collaborations, reflecting tailored financial commitments and strategic control. With Galapagos, Gilead pays a $150 million option exercise fee per program and shares development and mutually agreed commercialization costs equally after option exercise, indicating a balanced cost-sharing model. In contrast, with Merck, Gilead assumes a larger share of the global development and commercialization costs at 60%, while Merck covers 40%, with revenue-sharing structures that adjust based on sales thresholds, showing a more dominant financial and strategic role for Gilead. With Arcus, Gilead not only paid a $725 million opt-in fee but also shares global development costs and plans to equally split U.S. profits while retaining exclusive commercialization rights outside the U.S., demonstrating a hybrid model that combines upfront financial commitments with shared development responsibilities and asymmetric commercial control.",

      "question": "How does Gilead's financial treatment of royalty obligations to Japan Tobacco compare with its broader royalty and collaboration commitments, particularly in light of the $167 million in 2023 royalty payments, the $680 million in total royalty and revenue-sharing expenses, and the new collaboration funding structure with Abingworth involving potential future royalty payouts?",
      "answer": "Gilead's royalty obligations to Japan Tobacco in 2023 amounted to $167 million, which is a specific and recurring cost tied to product sales in Japan under a long-term licensing agreement. This is part of a broader set of royalty and revenue-sharing commitments, which totaled $680 million in 2023, including payments to Janssen and other licensors. Additionally, Gilead entered into a new funding arrangement with Abingworth in late 2023, where it received $50 million to co-fund Trodelvy development, with potential future royalty obligations if the drug achieves regulatory approval and commercial success. Unlike the fixed and historical royalty payments like those to Japan Tobacco, the Abingworth arrangement introduces a forward-looking, contingent royalty structure tied to performance milestones and net sales, reflecting a strategic shift toward risk-sharing partnerships.",

      "answer": "Amgen faces exposure to foreign exchange risk in international product sales, which they attempt to mitigate through a comprehensive hedging program involving cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. As of December 31, 2021, they had $3.4 billion in cross-currency swap contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated debt, and $5.7 billion in euro-based open forward contracts. Despite these measures, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in exchange rates could still reduce income by approximately $390 million in the following year. Additionally, international regulatory challenges, such as delays in clinical trial approvals in China due to evolving human genetic resource regulations, and uncertainties from Brexit, introduce further volatility to international product sales. These combined factors\u2014currency exposure, hedging limitations, and regulatory unpredictability\u2014pose material risks to Amgen's financial stability and global expansion strategy.",

Further, the first quarter of a year  historically  represents  the  lowest  product  sales  quarter  for  the  year,  in  part  due  to  plan  changes,  insurance  reverifications  and higher  co-pay  expenses  as  U.S.  patients  work  through  deductibles,  particularly  for  products  acquired  through  pharmacy  benefit programs.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we experienced changes in demand for some of our products. The pandemic has interrupted many physician-patient interactions, which has led to delays in diagnoses and treatments, with varying degrees of impact across our portfolio. In general, declines in the sales of our products that were impacted by the dynamics of the pandemic were most significant in the early months  of  the  pandemic  with  product  demand  beginning  to  show  some  recovery  in  late  2020.  During  2021,  we  observed  gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with patient visits and diagnosis rates that approached pre-pandemic levels early in the fourth quarter. However, late in the year, the Omicron variant began to impact the healthcare sector and as a result, we have seen some shift back to virtual engagement by our field staff and variability in demand patterns. The cumulative decrease in diagnoses over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect to continue to impact our business. Given  the  unpredictable  nature  of  the  pandemic,  we  expect  there  could  be  ongoing  intermittent  disruptions  in  physician-patient interactions, and as a result, we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability. In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem have the potential to introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment have led to changes to the insured population. Growth in numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals may have a negative impact on product demand and sales. Overall, uncertainty remains around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nOther revenues increased for 2021, primarily driven by the sale of COVID-19 antibody material resulting from our manufacturing collaboration.\n\nOperating expenses increased for 2021, driven by IPR&amp;D expense related to the bemarituzumab program acquired as part of the Five Prime acquisition and by the upfront payment associated with the KKC licensing agreement.\n\nAlthough changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2021, 2020 or 2019.",

These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $170 million and $250 million, respectively.\n\n## Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instruments\n\nOur  international  operations  are  affected  by  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  the  U.S.  dollar  compared  with  foreign  currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are  partially  offset  by  corresponding  increases  or  decreases  in  our  international  operating  expenses.  Increases  and  decreases  in  our foreign-currency-denominated  assets  from  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  are  partially  offset  by  corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterlingand  Swiss-franc-denominated  debt  with  a  principal  carrying  value  and  a  fair  value  of  $4.8  billion  and  $5.4  billion,  respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $710 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $640 million. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.0 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.\n\nWe have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $700 million and $1.1 billion on these  dates,  respectively.  The  impact  of  this  hypothetical  adverse  movement  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  on  ensuing  years' income from these contracts would be fully offset by corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.\n\nWe enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  that  are  designated  for  accounting  purposes  as  cash  flow  hedges  of  certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the fair values of these contracts were a $183 million asset and a $39 million liability. As of December 31, 2020, the fair values of these contracts were a $28 million asset and a $237 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.1 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $390 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  compared  with  the  U.S.  dollar  relative  to  exchange  rates  as  of  December  31,  2020,  would  have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $420 million.  The  analysis  does  not  consider  the  impact  that  hypothetical  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  would  have  on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had notional amounts of $0.7 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of  December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.",

          "chunk_text": "in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications .  Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products  and  predictable  pricing  controls.  For  example,  China  continues  to  strengthen  regulations  on  the  collection,  use  and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&amp;D activities in China. Our applications to the HGRAC seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry  in  the  home  country  against  foreign  competition,  far-reaching  antibribery  and  anticorruption  laws  and  regulations  and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments.\n\nAs we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency  hedging  arrangements,  our  hedging  efforts  do  not  completely  offset  the  effect  of  these  fluctuations  on  our  revenues  and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be completely phased out and replaced by 2023. In March 2020 and in January 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other  interbank  offered  rates  to  alternative  reference  rates.  While  it  appears  likely  that  SOFR  will  be  the  replacement reference rate adopted in the market, the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBORlinked financial instruments. See Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies-Recent accounting pronouncements. We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, commonly referred  to  as  'Brexit,'  which  occurred  on  January  31,  2020.  While  our  manufacturing  and  packaging  activities  take  place  largely outside the United Kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIES\n\nOur  sales  depend  on  coverage  and  reimbursement  from  government  and  commercial  third-party  payers,  and  pricing  and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability.\n\nSales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. These payers are increasingly focused on costs, which have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. These include proposals that would allow the U.S. government to negotiate drug prices directly, limit drug reimbursement  in  Medicare  and/or  the  commercial  market  based  on  reference  prices  or  permit  importation  of  drugs  from  Canada. Additional proposals would require a rebate to the government for any price increase in excess of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban  Consumers  and/or  to  shift  some  of  the  costs  of  these  Medicare  Part  D  reforms  to  manufacturers  to  offset  the  cost.  Certain proposals focused on drug pricing have been adopted and additional proposals are likely to be adopted and implemented in some form.\n\n- -Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected, and may continue to affect access to, pricing and sales of our products\n\nA substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Reimbursement. Our business has been and will  continue  to  be  affected  by  legislative  actions  changing  U.S.  federal  reimbursement  policy.  Congress  has  been  focused  on  drug pricing reforms and oversight since 2018, and this activity is still ongoing and has intensified. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, a number of Congressional committees debated drug pricing reform proposals and, in 2020, Amgen participated in House Oversight and Reform Committee hearings on drug pricing practices. In 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs",

      "answer": "Amgen uses a detailed methodology for estimating sales deductions such as rebates and chargebacks, which considers contractual and statutory requirements, historical data, forecasted customer buying patterns, and specific market trends. These estimates are product-specific and reviewed quarterly, with adjustments made based on actual results and changes in market conditions. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales, and changes in estimates for prior-year provisions have been immaterial, indicating a high degree of accuracy in their estimation process.

          "chunk_text": "## AMGEN INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Business\n\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its majority-owned subsidiaries. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits  from,  the  entity  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  that  entity. We  do  not  have  any  significant  interests  in  any  variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates.\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data with their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product,  when  appropriate.  Historically,  sales  return  provisions  have  amounted  to  less  than  1%  of  gross  product  sales.  Changes  in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\nOur  payment  terms  vary  by  types  and  locations  of  customers  and  by  products  or  services  offered.  Payment  terms  differ  by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.\n\nIndirect taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues.\n\nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in SG&amp;A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",

          "chunk_text": "In  the  United  States,  we  use  wholesalers  as  the  principal  means  of  distributing  our  products  to  healthcare  providers  such  as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.\n\nAccruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold.\n\nRebates  include  primarily  amounts  paid  to  payers  and  providers  in  the  United  States,  including  those  paid  to  state  Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population,  historical  experience  and  wholesaler  inventory  levels;  and  we  accrue  these  rebates  in  the  period  the  related  sales  are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ.\n\nWholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and  the  healthcare  providers.  The  provision  for  chargebacks  is  based  on  expected  sales  by  our  wholesaler  customers  to  healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.\n\n## Product returns\n\nReturns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on  examination  by  the  tax  authorities  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefit  recognized  in  the  consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new  regulations  or  interpretations  by  tax  authorities,  new  information  obtained  during  a  tax  examination  or  resolution  of  an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense.\n\nCertain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and  their  reported  amounts.  Such  temporary  differences  create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in tax returns in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  (iii)  liabilities  for  the  difference  between  the  book  basis  and  the  tax  basis  of  the  intangible assets  acquired  in  many  business  combinations,  because  future  expenses  associated  with  these  assets  most  often  will  not  be  tax deductible.",

Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.\n\nIn addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into  with  third  parties,  including  contingent  consideration  incurred  in  the  acquisitions  of  Teneobio  and  K-A.  These  payments  are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes. Except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration of approximately $0.3 billion, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $7.4 billion, including $1.6 billion of contingent consideration payments in connection with our Teneobio acquisition.\n\nWe have recorded liabilities for UTBs that, because of their nature, have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payment and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV-Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  notes  to  the  financial  statements.  Some  of  those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results  could  differ  materially  from  those  estimates  under  different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are included in Part IV-Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies.  The  following  are  considered  critical  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  because  they  require  the  most  difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

(including its subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and  delivering  innovative  human  therapeutics.  This  approach  begins  by  using  tools  like  advanced  human  genetics  to  unravel  the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.\n\nAmgen  focuses  on  areas  of  high  unmet  medical  need  and  leverages  its  expertise  to  strive  for  solutions  that  improve  health outcomes  and  dramatically  improve  people's  lives.  A  biotechnology  pioneer,  Amgen  has  grown  to  be  one  of  the  world's  leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\n\nAmgen was incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. We have a presence in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.\n\n## Significant Developments\n\nFollowing is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Business Development\n\n## Five Prime Therapeutics acquisition\n\n- On April 16, 2021, Amgen completed its acquisition of Five Prime, a public clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing immuno-oncology and targeted cancer therapies, for approximately $1.6 billion in cash, net of cash acquired.\n- In April 2021, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bemarituzumab as first-line treatment for patients with FGFR2b overexpressing and HER2-negative metastatic and locally advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma in combination  with  fluoropyrimidine,  leucovorin  and  oxaliplatin  based  on  an  FDA-approved  companion  diagnostic  assay showing at least 10% of tumor cells overexpressing FGFR2b.\n\n## KKC collaboration\n\n- We and KKC entered into an agreement, effective July 30, 2021, to jointly develop and commercialize KKC's potential firstin-class,  phase  3-ready anti-OX40 fully human monoclonal antibody in development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, with potential in other autoimmune diseases.\n\n## Teneobio acquisition\n\n- On October 19, 2021, Amgen completed its acquisition of Teneobio, a privately held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of biologics called human heavy-chain antibodies, which are single-chain antibodies composed of the human heavy-chain  domain,  for  $900  million  as  well  as  future  contingent  milestone  payments  potentially  worth  up  to  an additional $1.6 billion upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory events.\n\n## Products/Pipeline\n\n## Inflammation\n\n## Otezla\n\n- In December 2021, we announced that the FDA had approved the expanded indication for Otezla for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, across all severities.\n\n## TEZSPIRE\n\n- In  December  2021,  we  and  AstraZeneca  announced  that  the  FDA  had  approved  TEZSPIRE  for  the  add-on  maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates\n\nWe focus our R&amp;D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and seek to choose the optimal modality for a drug target and disease. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.\n\nOur discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success.\n\nSince  early  2021,  COVID-19  global  vaccination  efforts  have  been  under  way  to  control  the  pandemic.  However,  uncertainty remains  as  to  the  length  of  time  required  for  vaccination  of  a  meaningful  portion  of  the  population  and  as  to  the  efficacy  of  such vaccinations on the trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require  governments  to  issue  additional  restrictions  and/or  order  shutdowns  in  various  geographies.  As  a  result,  we  expect  to  see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. With regard to our drug development activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all countries where clinical trials occur. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  our  R&amp;D  expenses  were  $4.8  billion,  $4.2  billion  and  $4.1  billion, respectively.\n\nWe have major R&amp;D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland;  and  the  United  Kingdom,  as  well  as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.\n\nOur clinical  trial  activities  are  conducted  by  both  our  internal  staff  and  third-party  contract  clinical  trial  service  providers.  To increase  the  number  and  diversity  of  patients  available  for  enrollment  in  our  clinical  trials,  we  have  opened  clinical  sites  and  will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also  see  Item  1A.  Risk  FactorsWe must conduct  clinical  trials  in  humans  before  we  commercialize  and  sell  any  of  our  product candidates or existing products for new indications.\n\nSome of our competitors are actively engaged in R&amp;D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit  the  number  of  available  patients  who  meet  the  criteria  for  certain  clinical  trials.  The  competitive  marketplace  for  our  product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance,  thereby  contributing  to  a  product's  eventual  success  and  profitability.  Accordingly,  we  expect  that  in  some  cases,  the relative  speed  with  which  we  can  develop  products,  complete  clinical  testing,  receive  regulatory  approval  and  supply  commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.\n\nIn addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&amp;D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing  these  R&amp;D  arrangements  and  licensing  or  acquisition  activities,  we  face  competition  from  other  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&amp;D.\n\nThe following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 8, 2022, unless otherwise indicated. Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at www.amgen.com. (The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing.) The information in this section does not include other, nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication.\n\nWe  may  conduct  nonregistrational  clinical  trials  for  various  reasons,  including  to  evaluate  real-world  outcomes  or  to  collect additional safety information with regard to the use of products.",

      "question": "How does Amgen's treatment of IPR&D projects in acquisition accounting align with their impairment risk disclosures and historical amortization patterns, particularly in light of the $1.1 billion IPR&D acquisition from Teneobio?",
      "answer": "Amgen accounts for IPR&D projects acquired in business combinations at fair value on the acquisition date and classifies them as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment (page_108). These assets are subject to annual impairment testing and may be written off if a project is abandoned (page_109). This aligns with the risk disclosures on page_127, which emphasize major uncertainties such as regulatory approval timelines, clinical trial outcomes, and commercialization feasibility, all of which could lead to impairment. Furthermore, Amgen's historical amortization data shows that finite-lived intangible assets\u2014such as those potentially derived from completed IPR&D projects\u2014were amortized at $2.6 billion in 2021, with future estimates remaining substantial (page_127). This suggests that once IPR&D projects are successfully completed and transitioned into finite-lived assets, they contribute significantly to ongoing cost of sales, reinforcing the importance of both initial fair value estimation and subsequent impairment monitoring in accurately reflecting the economic value of these acquisitions.",

          "chunk_text": "ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease  payments  under  the  lease.  Lease  recognition  occurs  at  the  commencement  date,  and  lease  liability  amounts  are  based  on  the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease  payments  made  prior  to  the  commencement  date  less  lease  incentives  received.  Operating  lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with both lease and nonlease components, which are generally accounted for together as a single lease component.  In  addition,  for  certain  vehicle  and  equipment  leases,  we  apply  a  portfolio  approach  to  determine  the  lease  term  and discount rate.\n\n## Stock-based compensation\n\nWe  have  stock-based  compensation  plans  under  which  various  types  of  equity-based  awards  are  granted,  including  RSUs, performance units and stock options. The fair values of RSUs and stock option awards, which are subject only to service conditions with graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair values of performance unit awards are recognized as compensation expense, generally on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. See Note 4, Stock-based compensation.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  provision  for  income  taxes  and  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected  tax  consequences  of  temporary  differences  between  the  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  for  loss  and  tax  credit carryforwards for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\n\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon  examination  by  tax  authorities  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefit  recognized  in  the  consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is  adjusted  as  appropriate  for  changes  in  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  significant  amendments  to  existing  tax  law,  new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, when appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. See Note 6, Income taxes.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nWe first determine whether a set of assets acquired constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the  assets  acquired  do  not  constitute  a  business,  we  account  for  the  transaction  as  an  asset  acquisition.  Business  combinations  are accounted for  by  means  of  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting.  Under  the  acquisition  method,  assets  acquired,  including  IPR&amp;D projects,  and  liabilities  assumed  are  recorded  at  their  respective  fair  values  as  of  the  acquisition  date  in  our  consolidated  financial statements.  The  excess  of  the  fair  value  of  consideration  transferred  over  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired  is  recorded  as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination (including the assumption of an acquiree's  liability  arising  from  an  acquisition  it  consummated  prior  to  our  acquisition)  are  recorded  at  their  fair  values  on  the acquisition date and remeasured at their fair values each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The  resulting  changes  in  fair  values  are  recorded  in  earnings.  In  contrast,  asset  acquisitions  are  accounted  for  by  using  a  cost accumulation  and  allocation  model.  Under  this  model,  the  cost  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed. IPR&amp;D projects with no alternative future use are recorded in R&amp;D expense upon acquisition, and contingent consideration obligations  incurred  in  connection  with  an  asset  acquisition  are  recorded  when  it  is  probable  that  they  will  occur  and  they  can  be reasonably estimated. See Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 17, Fair value measurement.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nWe consider cash equivalents to be only those investments that are highly liquid, that are readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from the date of purchase.",

Investments  with  maturities  beyond  one  year  may  be classified as short-term marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to their highly liquid nature and because they represent  the  Company's  investments  that  are  available  for  current  operations.  See  Note  9,  Investments,  and  Note  17,  Fair  value measurement.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes amounts related to materials, labor and overhead, is determined in a manner that approximates the first-in, first-out method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. See Note 10, Inventories.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been formally designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship under the applicable accounting standards and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, we assess both at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Our derivatives that are not designated and do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. See Note 17, Fair value measurement, and Note 18, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment, net\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  recorded  at  historical  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation,  amortization  and,  if  applicable, impairment charges. We review our property, plant and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Depreciation is recorded over the assets' useful lives on a straightline basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. See Note 11, Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nFinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  recorded  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  amortization,  and,  if  applicable,  impairment  charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is recorded over the assets' estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  See  Note  12, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nThe fair values of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination that are not complete are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  related  R&amp;D  efforts.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life. If a project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately. Major risks and uncertainties are often associated with IPR&amp;D projects because we are required to obtain regulatory  approvals  before  marketing  the  resulting  products.  Such  approvals  require  completing  clinical  trials  that  demonstrate  a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&amp;D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&amp;D impairment charges may occur in future periods.\n\nCapitalized IPR&amp;D projects are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  consider  various  factors  for  potential  impairment,  including  the  current  legal  and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape. Adverse clinical trial results, significant delays in obtaining marketing approval, the inability to bring a product to market and the introduction or advancement of competitors' products could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible assets.\n\nWe perform an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. To date, an impairment of goodwill has not been recorded. See Note 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets.",

          "chunk_text": "\nDeveloped-product-technology rights  consists  of  rights  related  to  marketed  products  acquired  in  acquisitions.  Licensing  rights consists  primarily  of  contractual  rights  acquired  in  acquisitions  to  receive  future  milestone,  royalty  and  profit-sharing  payments; capitalized payments to third parties for milestones related to regulatory approvals to commercialize products; and up-front payments associated with royalty obligations for marketed products. Marketing-related rights consists primarily of rights related to the sale and distribution of marketed products. R&amp;D technology rights pertains to technologies used in R&amp;D that have alternative future uses.\n\nIPR&amp;D consists  of  R&amp;D  projects  acquired  in  a  business  combination  that  are  not  complete  at  the  time  of  acquisition  due  to remaining  technological  risks  and/or  lack  of  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals.  All  IPR&amp;D  projects  have  major  risks  and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the development and commercialization of product candidates, including  our  ability  to  confirm  safety  and  efficacy  based  on  data  from  clinical  trials,  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary  regulatory approvals  and  our  ability  to  successfully  complete  these  tasks  within  budgeted  costs.  We  are  not  permitted  to  market  a  human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&amp;D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&amp;D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired certain finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the Teneobio acquisition, including IPR&amp;D of $1.1 billion, R&amp;D technology rights of $94 million and licensing rights of $41 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  recognized  amortization  associated  with  our  finite-lived intangible assets of $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is included primarily in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total estimated amortization for our finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, are $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.",

      "question": "How does Amgen's growing accumulated deficit of $24.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, reconcile with its capital allocation strategy of increasing dividends and aggressive stock repurchases, while maintaining sufficient liquidity and a strong balance sheet?",
      "answer": "Amgen's accumulated deficit increased to $24.6 billion by the end of 2021, primarily due to significant stock repurchases totaling $5.0 billion in 2021 and growing dividend payments, which reached $1.76 per share quarterly in 2021. Despite this, Amgen maintains a strong liquidity position with $8.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and continues to fund its capital return strategy through operating cash flow and access to debt markets. The company explicitly states that the accumulated deficit does not impair its ability to operate, pay dividends, repurchase shares, or service debt, given its expectation of continued profitability and diversified funding sources.",

        "Hop 2: [AMGN](page_103) \u2192 [Accumulated Deficit]: Reports the accumulated deficit of $24,600 million as part of total stockholders' equity, highlighting its material presence on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Hop 3: [AMGN](page_73) \u2192 [Accumulated Deficit]: Explains that the accumulated deficit results from dividend payments and stock repurchases, including $5.0 billion in 2021 repurchases, but asserts that the deficit does not constrain operations or capital returns due to strong cash reserves and financing flexibility."

The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nConsistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases.\n\nWe intend to continue investing in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business and our desire to optimize our cost of capital. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determination by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company's agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include block purchases, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases and market transactions.\n\nThe Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.76, $1.60 and $1.45 per share of common stock paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2021 and 2020. In December 2021, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.94 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2022.\n\nWe  also  returned  capital  to  stockholders  through  our  stock  repurchase  program.  During  2021,  we  repurchased  and  had  cash settlements of $5.0 billion of common stock. In 2020, we repurchased and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion of common stock. In 2019,  we  repurchased  $7.6  billion  of  common  stock  and  had  cash  settlements  of  $7.7  billion.  In  March  2021,  October  2021  and December 2021, the Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by $3.4 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $10.9 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.\n\nAs a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.\n\nWe believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy  our  needs  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditure  and  debt  service  requirements,  our  plans  to  pay  dividends  and  repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our  liquidity  needs  can  be  met  through  a  variety  of  sources,  including  cash  provided  by  operating  activities,  sales  of  marketable securities,  borrowings  through  commercial  paper  and/or  syndicated  credit  facilities,  and  access  to  other  domestic  and  foreign  debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk FactorsGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business .",

      "question": "What is the total value of alternative investments held in Eli Lilly's retiree health benefit plans as of December 31, 2021, and how does this allocation compare to the broader pension and retiree health plan assets in terms of valuation complexity and funding status?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2021, Eli Lilly's retiree health benefit plans held $229.7 million in hedge funds and $223.4 million in equity-like funds, totaling $453.1 million in alternative investments. These investments are part of the broader $19,777.4 million in pension and retiree health plan assets, of which approximately 38% ($7,515.4 million) were allocated to alternative investments. These alternative investments are noted to carry higher estimation uncertainty due to the use of significant unobservable inputs or reliance on net asset values (NAV) from counterparties, which introduces complexity in valuation. Additionally, the company reported that certain benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, indicating underfunding, though the exact amount for retiree health plans alone is not specified.",

          "chunk_text": "## Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Retirement Benefits - Valuation of Alternative Investments\n\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Benefit Plan Investments,\" the Company's benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in relationship to the respective liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company had $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and inperson or telephonic meetings with investment firms to discuss valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values and reconciling any differences. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\n\n/s/    Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 23, 2022",

      "answer": "Eli Lilly estimates Medicaid and Medicare rebate liabilities by analyzing historical rebate payments as a percentage of past sales, while also incorporating forward-looking adjustments for changes in sales trends, pricing, and regulatory interpretations. This approach directly affects the company's net product revenue and results in a significant liability\u2014$6,845.8 million as of December 31, 2021\u2014primarily concentrated in U.S. programs.

          "chunk_text": "## Net Product Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Provisions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are received; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\n\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health care professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of consolidated revenue. Further, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 28 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\n\n## Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- We initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we must estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\n- The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value approach.\n- The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rebates related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.\n- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.",

          "chunk_text": "## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.\n\n## Financial Statement Impact\n\nWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $366 million effect on our income before income taxes.\n\nThe portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate accruals\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Net Product Revenue,\" the Company establishes provisions for sales rebate and discounts in the same period as the related sales occur. At December 31, 2021 the Company had $6,845.8 million in sales rebate and discount accruals. A large portion of these accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is covered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the subjectivity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, an evaluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold via Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. For Medicaid, there is significant complexity associated with calculating the legislated Medicaid rebates. Management utilizes employees with legislative experience and knowledge in developing assumptions used to calculate Medicaid rebates. Similarly, for Managed Care and Medicare, given variability in prescription drug costs, continued historical year over year increases in enrollees and variability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictive for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon current utilization.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the valuation of the sales rebate and discount liabilities. This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions used to calculate the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate liabilities, including the significant assumptions discussed above. This testing also included management's control to compare actual activity to forecasted activity and controls to ensure the data used to evaluate the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating for reasonableness the significant assumptions in light of economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. Our testing involved assessing the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performing analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. Additionally, our procedures included reviewing a sample of contracts, testing a sample of rebate payments and testing the underlying data used in management's evaluation. For Medicaid, we involved our professionals with an understanding of the statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with the applicable government regulations and policy. For Medicare we evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions made by management in estimating the Medicare coverage gap liability.",

      "answer": "LLY's net product revenue is reported as a standalone financial metric showing growth from $20,377.3 million in 2019 to $25,957.9 million in 2021. However, in the Tyvyt collaboration with Innovent, net product revenue reflects only LLY's portion of Tyvyt sales in China, with Innovent's share accounted for in cost of sales. Additionally, LLY is obligated to pay Innovent up to $825.0 million for regulatory and sales milestones outside of China and up to $195.0 million in China, along with tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside China. For Olumiant, LLY records all sales as net product revenue but pays Incyte tiered double-digit royalties on worldwide net sales, including up to the low teens for sales related to the treatment of COVID-19 that exceed a threshold. LLY also capitalized $260.0 million and $210.0 million in milestone payments related to Olumiant approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan as of 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are amortized into cost of sales.

(Dermira) and Loxo Oncology, Inc. (Loxo), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed in this note below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting.

The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the following countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must occur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3 cents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire without payment.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition establishes a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy program that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical development that we acquired were PR001 for patients with Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. Both PR001 and PR006 were granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",

As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the U.S. and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021, we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from U.S. and international governments, including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government, and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19 antibodies.\n\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&amp;D) (Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n- We recognized acquired IPR&amp;D charges of $874.9 million related to business development transactions.\n\nAsset Impairment, Restructuring, and Other Special Charges (Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n- We recognized charges of $316.1 million primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo Oncology, Inc.

      "question": "How does Eli Lilly's accounting treatment of collaboration revenue from the Jardiance and Trajenta partnerships reflect the interplay between upfront milestone payments, profit-sharing dynamics, and regulatory approval risks outlined in their revenue recognition policies?",
      "answer": "Eli Lilly's collaboration revenue from the Jardiance and Trajenta partnerships is shaped by a layered accounting approach. First, upfront fees and developmental milestones (such as those tied to regulatory approvals) are deferred and amortized through the expected product approval date, rather than recognized immediately, due to the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes and the risk that products may not gain approval (page 64). Second, profit-sharing revenue, based on gross margins reported by partners like Boehringer Ingelheim, is recognized as collaboration and other revenue as it is earned (page 63). This revenue stream is tied directly to the performance of the partner and introduces variability. Third, historical collaboration and other revenue figures \u2014 such as the $175.0 million reported in 2021 \u2014 reflect the culmination of these accounting treatments, including both profit-sharing and royalty components (page 61). The deferral of milestone payments and the risk of non-approval highlight the cautious recognition of revenue, aligning with the broader biopharma industry challenges around timing and predictability in partnership income.",

          "chunk_text": "## Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- When product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales using an expected value approach. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictive than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserve for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserve for product returns, we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers; however, our data on inventory levels in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns have been less than 2 percent of our U.S. revenue during each of the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusivity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nWe record adjustments to revenue as a result of changes in estimates, for the judgments described above, for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates and discounts liability balances. Such adjustments for products shipped in previous periods resulted in approximately 2 percent or less increase to U.S revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are not contracts with customers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of revenue (e.g., royalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\n- Initial fees and developmental milestones we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangements from the partnering of our compounds under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other revenue as earned.",

This royalty revenue is included in collaboration and other revenue.\n- For arrangements involving multiple goods or services (e.g., research and development, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and distribution), each required good or service is evaluated to determine whether it is distinct. If a good or service does not qualify as distinct, it is combined with the other non-distinct goods or services within the arrangement and these combined goods or services are treated as a single performance obligation for accounting purposes. The arrangement's transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. For arrangements that involve variable consideration where we have sold intellectual property, we recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount of consideration we believe we will be entitled to receive from the other party, subject to a constraint. These estimates are adjusted to reflect the actual amounts to be collected when those facts and circumstances become known.\n- Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in development will not receive regulatory approval, we generally do not recognize any contingent payments that would be due to us upon or after regulatory approval.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nOur contract liabilities result from arrangements where we have received payment in advance of performance under the contract and do not include sales returns, rebates, and discounts. Changes in contract liabilities are generally due to either receipt of additional advance payments or our performance under the contract.\n\nThe following table summarizes contract liability balances:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline.\n\n## Risks Related to AbbVie's Business\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie's employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\n\n## The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nAbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.\n\nAs patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.\n\nAbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations,\" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018.",

In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.\n\nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year.\n\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets.",

      "question": "How does AbbVie's net investment hedging activity impact its comprehensive income over the 2019\u20132021 period, considering the reclassification adjustments, tax effects, and overall volatility in other comprehensive income?",
      "answer": "AbbVie\u2019s net investment hedging activities contributed both positively and negatively to comprehensive income over the 2019\u20132021 period. In 2019, net investment hedging added $74 million (net of a $22 tax benefit) to comprehensive income. In 2020, it had a negative impact of $799 million (net of a $221 tax expense), and in 2021, it rebounded with a positive contribution of $699 million (net of a $193 tax expense). These fluctuations were influenced by reclassification adjustments, which were $21 million in losses in 2021, $14 million in losses in 2020, and $21 million in losses in 2019. The tax effects further modulated the net impact on comprehensive income each year. This volatility reflects the dynamic nature of AbbVie\u2019s hedging strategy and its interaction with broader financial performance and risk management.",

      "answer": "AbbVie's consolidated net foreign exchange loss reported on the income statement for 2021 was $51 million (page_77), significantly lower than the $100 million loss from unhedged foreign currency forward contracts (page_111). This discrepancy is explained by the company\u2019s broader foreign exchange risk management strategy, which includes $8.2 billion in notional value of unhedged contracts designed to offset foreign currency exposure from trade payables, receivables, and intercompany loans (page_109). The net result reflects effective offsetting gains within these unhedged positions, reducing the overall impact on earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Financial Instruments\n\nVarious AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designed as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.\n\nThe company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of \u20ac5.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and \u20ac6.6 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling \u20ac4.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and \u20ac971 million at December 31, 2020. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\n\nNo amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.\n\n75 | 2021 Form 10-K",

At December 31, 2024, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $777 million for Abbott's defined benefit plans and net losses of $21 million for Abbott's medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a fiveyear period.\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets - Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter. An undiscounted net cash flows approach is used to test for impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. G oodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2024, goodwill amounted to $23.1 billion and net intangibles amounted to $6.6 billion. Amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.9 billion in 2024 and $2.0 billion per year in 2023 and 2022. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nLitigation - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, 'Contingencies.' Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $25 million to $35 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $30 million have been recorded at December 31, 2024 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, 'Contingencies.'",

      "question": "How does Abbott's transition tax obligation under the TCJA reconcile with its tax expense adjustments in 2024, the net unrecognized tax benefits disclosed in the footnotes, and the ongoing IRS disputes over income reallocation?",
      "answer": "Abbott's remaining transition tax obligation under the TCJA is $432 million, to be paid over the next two years. This aligns with the $210 million of transition tax obligation included in the $860 million of net unrecognized tax benefits disclosed in the footnotes for 2024. Additionally, the $7.5 billion non-cash valuation allowance adjustment in tax expense for 2024 reflects a strategic restructuring of foreign affiliates, which may relate to the IRS's ongoing challenges over income reallocation between U.S. and foreign entities, as seen in the Statutory Notices of Deficiency for 2017\u20132019 tax years. Together, these elements suggest that Abbott's transition tax obligation is part of a broader, complex tax posture involving deferred assets, unrecognized liabilities, and contested international income allocations.",

Interest ex pense decreased in 2024 due to the repayment of approximately $2.25 billion of long-term debt in September and November of 2023, partially offset by a reduction in interest income due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances versus the prior year. Interest expense, net decreased $123 million in 2023 due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fix ed-rate debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther income, net was $376 million of income in 2024, $479 million of income in 2023 and $321 million of income in 2022. Other income, net includes income of approximately $542 million, $498 million, and $406 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. The decrease in 2024 reflects the recognition of a $143 million loss on the sale of a non-core business related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. The decrease in 2024 was partially offset by an increase in income associated with the nonservice cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. In 2023, Other income, net included equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $39 million, as well as income from a $42 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to previous business acquisitions.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nTaxes on earnings reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties.

Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\n\nIn the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  for  the  2019  Federal  tax   year  in  the  amount  of  $417  million.  The  primary  adjustments  proposed  in  the  SNOD  relate  to  the reallocation of income between Abbott's U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.\n\nIn June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $192 million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.",

In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon\u2122, Duphaston\u2122, Femoston\u2122 and Influvac\u2122. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.\n\nMedical Devices - Abbott's research and development programs focus on:\n\n- Cardiac  Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n- Heart Failure - Continued enhancements to Abbott's mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n- Electrophysiology - Development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n- Vascular - Development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.\n- Structural Heart - Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction.\n- Neuromodulation  -  Development  of  clinical  evidence  and  next-generation  technologies  leveraging  digital  health  to  support  improved  patient  clinical outcomes, physician engagement, and expanded indications in the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications.\n- Diabetes Care - Develop enhancements and additional indications for continuous monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.\n\nNutritionals - Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastrointestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.\n\nCore  Laboratory  Diagnostics  - Abbott  continues  to  commercialize  its  next-generation  blood  and  plasma  screening,  immunoassay,  clinical  chemistry  and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical needs, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, and neurologic assays as well as informatics solutions to help optimize  diagnostics  laboratory  performance  and  automation  solutions  to  increase  efficiency  in laboratories.\n\nRapid Diagnostics - Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology.\n\nIn addition, the Diagnostic Products segment continues to pursue the FDA's customary regulatory process for remaining COVID-19 tests for which Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) were obtained and yet to be cleared.\n\nGiven the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is ex pected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2024 research and development activities that are ex pected to have a material impact on operations.\n\nWhile the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. G iven the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of new products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total Abbott sales in 2025. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.",

These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  November 2023, the  FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ,  which  ex pands  the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2024. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements, but required additional disclosures, retrospectively applied to all periods presented in Note 16 -Segment and geographic area information.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2024-03, Income  Statement  (Subtopic  220-40):  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income  -  Expense  Disaggregation Disclosures , which requires an entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific income statement expense categories. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively.  The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2027 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's  products  under  a  contract  most  impact  which  products  are  sold;  price  controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world.

      "question": "How does Merck's significant 2023 non-GAAP EPS impact from upfront and milestone payments reconcile with its strategic capital allocation decisions and its internal use of non-GAAP metrics for performance assessment and compensation?",
      "answer": "Merck's 2023 non-GAAP EPS was negatively affected by $6.21 due to charges related to upfront and pre-approval milestone payments from collaborations and licensing agreements, indicating substantial investment in external science and technologies aligned with its capital allocation strategy. This strategy includes prioritizing investments to address unmet medical needs and supporting commercial opportunities, as well as maintaining a strong dividend. Internally, Merck uses non-GAAP EPS for monthly performance analysis, planning, forecasting, and determining employee compensation, suggesting that despite the negative impact, these metrics remain central to evaluating business performance and strategic execution.",

      "question": "How does Merck's revenue structure from Reblozyl through its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb compare to its other alliance revenue arrangements in terms of royalty rates, milestone components, and segment reporting practices?",
      "answer": "Merck's revenue structure for Reblozyl involves a 20% royalty from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), which can increase to 24% based on sales levels, and includes potential future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up to $80 million. This contrasts with alliance revenue for Lynparza and Lenvima, which are based on profit-sharing models rather than royalties, and Adempas/Verquvo, which also follows a profit-sharing structure. Additionally, Merck recorded $212 million in alliance revenue for Reblozyl in 2023, compared to $166 million in 2022 and $17 million in 2021. In terms of segment reporting, Reblozyl's alliance revenue is included within the Pharmaceutical segment, alongside other alliance revenue streams like Lynparza, Lenvima, and Adempas/Verquvo, which are similarly reported within the same segment. This reveals a consistent approach to segment reporting for alliance revenue, while the revenue structures themselves vary significantly across collaborations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MRK](page_126) \u2192 [Alliance Revenue]: Page 126 details Merck's alliance revenue structures, noting that Reblozyl's revenue consists of royalties and milestone payments, contrasting with profit-sharing models for Lynparza, Lenvima, and Adempas/Verquvo.",
        "Hop 2: [MRK](page_90) \u2192 [Alliance Revenue]: Page 90 provides specifics on the Reblozyl collaboration with BMS, including the 20% royalty rate (up to 24% based on sales), potential milestone payments of up to $80 million, and alliance revenue of $212 million in 2023, $166 million in 2022, and $17 million in 2021.",

      "question": "How does the growth in Merck's Pharmaceutical segment oncology and vaccine sales, particularly Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9, align with the company's product-based management structure and global distribution strategy?",
      "answer": "Merck's Pharmaceutical segment sales grew significantly in 2023, with oncology products like Keytruda generating $25,011 million in total revenue, and vaccines such as Gardasil/Gardasil 9 reaching $8,886 million in total sales, reflecting strong performance in these core therapeutic areas. This aligns with the company's product-based management structure, which focuses on therapeutic categories and vaccines, and its global distribution strategy targeting drug wholesalers, retailers, hospitals, and government entities. The global reach is further emphasized by international sales contributing heavily to both Keytruda ($9,897 million) and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 ($6,803 million) in 2023, demonstrating how Merck's operational structure supports its commercial execution across different geographies and therapeutic segments.",

      "question": "How does Merck's presentation of 'Other Noncurrent Liabilities' in the balance sheet reconcile with its role in housing the long-term portion of the TCJA transition tax liability and its allocation across pension and postretirement benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "Merck reports 'Other Noncurrent Liabilities' at $928 million as of December 31, 2023, in the balance sheet. This liability includes $518 million of the long-term portion of the TCJA transition tax liability, separate from the $976 million included in 'Income taxes payable'. Additionally, the liabilities section reveals that $593 million of U.S. pension obligations and $158 million of other postretirement benefits are classified under 'Other Noncurrent Liabilities', indicating that these long-term obligations collectively contribute significantly to the total balance. This alignment shows how the same line item aggregates distinct liabilities with different characteristics and implications for the company's financial structure.",

      "question": "How does Johnson & Johnson's inclusion of profit-share payments in sales to customers compare in magnitude to its sales returns reserve, and what does this suggest about the relative significance of collaborative arrangement income compared to return-related revenue adjustments across its business segments?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson reports that profit-share payments from collaborative arrangements are included in sales to customers and have consistently represented less than 3.0% of total revenues across all years presented. In contrast, the company\u2019s sales returns reserve has averaged approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales over the same period. This suggests that collaborative arrangement income, while not dominant, is a meaningful component of revenue, exceeding the scale of return-related adjustments. Furthermore, the discussion of profit-share payments appears in both the Medical Devices segment context and in broader revenue recognition disclosures, indicating that these payments are relevant across multiple business lines, even if no single segment dominates the collaborative arrangements.",

          "chunk_text": "Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\n\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach",

Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\n\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.\n\n## Consumer Health Segment\n\nBalance at\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\n\n## Other Information\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company's future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson reported a contingent consideration reversal of $1,148 million in 2020 related to the Auris Health acquisition in their cash flow statement (page 51), which is also explicitly called out in segment reporting under Medical Devices as a $1.1 billion reversal tied to developmental milestone timing (page 89). This reversal was further detailed in the fair value accounting section (page 66), where it was noted that the adjustment was recorded in 'Other income and expense' and classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson maintains a consistent 1.0% sales returns reserve rate as a percentage of annual net trade sales for fiscal years 2019\u20132021 (page_55). This reserve is calculated based on historical return trends by product and market, with specific investigation into products that exhibit unusual return patterns (page_40). The reserve is recorded at full sales value and applies primarily to the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments, where returns are almost exclusively non-resalable, while certain Medical Devices segment returns are typically resalable but not material (page_54). The consistency in the 1.0% rate suggests stable historical return behavior across segments, despite differing resalability characteristics, indicating that the methodology of using historical data effectively captures the risk across product lines.",

          "chunk_text": "Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\n\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

          "chunk_text": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\n\n## Other Information\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company's future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in",

Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years.\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities.

CI:LABO.\n\nThe Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities of $0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&amp;D for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion, marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of approximately $1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company's current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&amp;D impairment charge of $0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&amp;D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18% to 66% across Ottava subplatforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5%.\n\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.6 billion. During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the company at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($120 million) of this loan into approximately 9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $2.8 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.\n\n## 19.

      "question": "How does BMS's treatment of contingent milestones in its collaborations with BridgeBio, 2seventy bio, and Eisai align with its accounting policies and revenue recognition practices for such payments, particularly in terms of expensing, amortization, and variable consideration estimation?",
      "answer": "BMS's treatment of contingent milestones in its collaborations with BridgeBio, 2seventy bio, and Eisai is consistent with its broader accounting policies and revenue recognition practices. In the BridgeBio deal, BMS committed up to $815 million in contingent milestones, while in the Eisai collaboration, BMS is obligated to pay up to $2.5 billion upon achievement of similar milestones. These contingent payments are aligned with the accounting policy described on page 84, where upfront and contingent development and regulatory milestones payable prior to regulatory approval are expensed to Acquired IPRD. This is consistent with the $650 million upfront fee paid to Eisai in 2021, which was expensed to Acquired IPRD. Furthermore, on page 81, BMS explains that contingent development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones are estimated using the most likely amount method due to their binary nature, and are only recognized when a significant reversal is not probable. This aligns with the structured approach BMS applies in its collaborations, where contingent payments are evaluated based on the probability of occurrence and timing of recognition, and supports the integration of these obligations into the company\u2019s broader financial reporting framework.",

      "question": "How does BMY's treatment of Acquired IPRD as an expense line item align with its accounting policy for in-process R&D assets and the specific licensing and acquisition activities reported elsewhere in the filing?",
      "answer": "BMY's Acquired IPRD is reported as a $55 million expense in 2023 (page_85), consistent with its accounting policy that IPRD assets with no alternative future use are charged to Acquired IPRD expense (page_77). This aligns with the broader context where BMY incurred $913 million in Acquired IPRD costs in 2023 (page_55), reflecting specific transactions such as the Prothena opt-in license fee ($55M) and Zenas upfront license ($50M), which may have contributed to the expense. The policy clarifies that in asset acquisitions, IPRD with no alternative use is immediately expensed, explaining the direct charge seen in the alliance payments section. This synthesis reveals a consistent application of accounting rules to specific business development activities.",

      "answer": "The significant increase in BMY's Provision for Restructuring from $75 million in 2022 to $365 million in 2023 suggests a substantial ramp-up in restructuring activities during the year. This is corroborated by the consistent mention of integration expenses at $242 million in both the consolidated statements of earnings (page_58) and other comprehensive income (page_55), indicating ongoing integration efforts likely tied to restructuring. However, the absence of divestiture gains in 2023 (compared to a $211 million loss in 2022, as seen on page_91) implies that the company may not have monetized assets during the year, focusing instead on internal restructuring. This combination of increased restructuring provisions, steady integration costs, and lack of divestiture activity suggests a strategic shift toward internal realignment rather than external asset sales in 2023.",

      "question": "How does the $542 million noncash contract settlement expense recorded in 2021 align with the detailed $581 million present value of payments to Quidel, and how is this settlement classified across operating, investing, and financing activities in the cash flow statement?",
      "answer": "The $542 million noncash contract settlement expense recorded in 2021 (page 75) reflects the unfavorable nature of the prior commercial arrangement with Quidel, which was modified and partially terminated (page 96). This expense corresponds to the present value of $581 million in payments to Quidel over the settlement period, of which $547 million was recorded as the pretax expense (page 96). In the cash flow statement, the $542 million is added back to net earnings as a noncash item in operating activities (page 75). Additionally, the settlement included $34 million in capitalized intangible assets, which represent a noncash investing activity (page 96), and a $576 million noncash financing activity due to the extended payment terms of the obligation (page 58). Thus, the settlement is reflected across all three cash flow categories: operating (noncash expense), investing (capitalized intangible assets), and financing (long-term obligation).",

These increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and accrued and prepaid expenses in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n- Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, and decreased primarily as a result of lower cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n- As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.\n\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $8.4 billion for 2021, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion, or 34%, as compared to 2020. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\n- 2021 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n- Net earnings for 2021 reflected an increase of approximately $679 million of depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense as compared to 2020. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Contract settlement expense represents the pretax charge related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the contract settlement expense. Depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and contract settlement expense are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Cash flows from the gain on sale of product lines and loss on the extinguishment of debt are reflected in cash flows from investing activities while unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the Company.\n- The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $564 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $160 million of operating cash flows used in 2020. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.\n- The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $94 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $739 million provided in 2020. The timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $13.0 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $21.2 billion of net cash used in 2020.\n\n## Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's 2021 and 2020 acquisitions and divestitures refer to '-Overview' and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2021 and 2020, the Company invested $934 million and $342 million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.",

Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws.\n\nTax authorities in Denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the Company's subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company received a notice from the Danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed on the original tax assessments. Taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately DKK 2.1 billion including interest accrued to date (approximately $317 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021). The Company's appeal of the tax assessments with the Danish National Tax Tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the Danish High Court. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, as a result of the payments the Company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accruals, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.\n\nManagement estimates that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations may be reduced by approximately $58 million within 12 months as a result of resolution of worldwide tax matters, payments of tax audit settlements and/or statute of limitations expirations. Future resolution of uncertain tax positions related to discontinued operations may result in additional charges or credits to earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (refer to Note 3).\n\nThe Company operates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions where income tax incentives and rulings have been granted for specific periods of time. In Switzerland, the Company has various tax rulings and tax holiday arrangements which reduce the overall effective tax rate of the Company. The tax holidays expire between 2022 and 2027. In Singapore, the Company operates under various tax incentive agreements that provide for reduced tax rates. Subject to the Company satisfying certain requirements, the agreements expire in 2022.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company had satisfied the conditions enumerated in these agreements. Included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are tax benefits of $59 million, $43 million and $71 million (or $0.08, $0.06 and $0.10 per diluted common share) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from these rulings and tax holidays.\n\n## NOTE 8. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nEffective July 24, 2021, the Company's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Beckman Coulter, Inc. ('Beckman'), entered into a series of related agreements with Quidel Corporation and a subsidiary thereof ('Quidel') to resolve litigation that Beckman initiated against Quidel and to modify and partially terminate the related prior commercial arrangement. Pursuant to the related agreements, the dispute regarding Beckman's ability to compete in B-type Naturietic Peptide ('BNP') test related activities has been settled, allowing Beckman to research, develop, manufacture and distribute BNP type tests. Beckman's commitment to supply certain BNP test kits to Quidel has also been terminated. Beckman also obtained the right to distribute and sell the BNP assay currently sold by Quidel. As consideration under the agreements, Beckman will pay Quidel predominantly fixed payments of approximately $75 million per year through 2029 (subject to proration in 2021). The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the value of the elements of the transaction. The present value of the payments to Quidel is estimated to be $581 million, of which $547 million was recorded as a pretax contract settlement expense primarily due to the unfavorable nature of the prior arrangement (consisting of a cash charge of $5 million and a noncash charge of $542 million) in the third quarter of 2021 related to the modification and partial termination of the prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. The Company also capitalized $34 million in intangible assets, comprised of proprietary technology, customer relationships and the use of a trade name acquired in the settlement, which represent a noncash investing activity. Due to the extended payment terms of the arrangement, the arrangement represents a noncash financing activity of $576 million. Over the period of the arrangement, the cash payments related to servicing the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from financing activities and the payments related to the imputed interest on the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

      "answer": "Core sales growth reflects varying business dynamics across the Diagnostics segment, enterprise-wide performance, and Cytiva's impact. Within the Diagnostics segment (page_50), core sales growth was driven by increased demand in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs, and pathology, with strong performance in both developed and high-growth markets, especially for COVID-19 testing solutions. At the enterprise level (page_51), core sales growth was reported at 8.0%, showing a more moderate increase compared to the Diagnostics segment alone, indicating balanced growth across other segments. When including Cytiva's contribution (page_48), core sales growth rose to 27.5%, significantly higher than the 23.0% without Cytiva, highlighting Cytiva\u2019s substantial role in driving overall growth. This synthesis shows that while the Diagnostics segment was a strong performer on its own, Cytiva's inclusion amplified the company's overall growth trajectory.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 Sales Compared to 2020\n\nPrice increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2021 as compared with 2020 and are reflected as a component of the change in core sales growth.\n\nDuring 2021, total Diagnostics segment sales increased 33.0% primarily as a result of increased core sales resulting from the factors discussed below. In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020, and the impact of sales from acquisitions increased reported sales by 0.5% in 2021. During 2021, the Diagnostics segment experienced higher year-over-year sales for molecular diagnostics tests for COVID-19. Demand across the other Diagnostics segment businesses also increased with non-COVID product lines testing volumes improving as individuals resumed visits to healthcare providers following the easing of shutdowns and restrictions related to the pandemic. In 2021, core sales in the segment's clinical lab business increased on a year-over-year basis across all major geographies driven primarily by continued increased demand in the chemistry and immunoassay product lines. During 2021, core sales in the molecular diagnostics business grew on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets, which contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The business continued to experience strong growth in sales of consumables, driven primarily by increased sales of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19, as increased production capacity allowed the business to produce more diagnostic tests in response to continued market growth, and higher year-over-year demand for testing for non-respiratory diseases. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year due to continued strong demand for blood gas consumables and immunoassay products, partially offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales largely due to strong COVID-19 related demand for blood gas instruments in 2020. Geographically, demand was strong across most major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year across all major geographies, driven by increased demand for core histology, advanced staining and pathology imaging products.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins increased 270 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020. The following factors impacted year-overyear operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 810 basis points\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses - 20 basis points",

Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher's business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher's revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher's peers. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance, and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the Company's executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva sales, in the case of core sales growth including Cytiva) and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.\n\n## Core Sales Growth and Core Sales Growth Including Cytiva\n\n",

The potential negative impact will depend on future developments including but not limited to:\n\n- the degree of spread and severity of COVID-19 variants such as Omicron; and\n- the timing and durability of continued recovery in the global demand for our non-COVID-19 related products and services.\n\nFor additional information on the risks of COVID-19 to the Company's operations, refer to the 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company acquired Aldevron, L.L.C. ('Aldevron') for a cash purchase price of approximately $9.6 billion (the 'Aldevron Acquisition'). Aldevron manufactures high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and proteins, serving biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers across research, clinical and commercial applications, and is now part of the Company's Life Sciences segment. Aldevron generated revenues of approximately $300 million in 2020. The acquisition of Aldevron is expected to provide additional sales and earnings opportunities for the Company by expanding product line diversity, including new product offerings supporting genomic medicine. The Company financed the Aldevron Acquisition using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.\n\nIn addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, during 2021 the Company acquired 13 other businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company's acquisitions.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measures of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) and core sales including Cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') but excluding:\n\n- sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and\n- the impact of currency translation.\n\nReferences to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations; provided that in calculating core sales including Cytiva, Cytiva's sales (net of the sales of the Company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire Cytiva, or the 'divested product lines') ('Cytiva sales') are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)); and\n- the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.\n\nAs noted above, beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020, the Company also presents core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Prior to the acquisition of Cytiva, Danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva's significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher's existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition Cytiva's impact on the Company's growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact until 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher's core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding Cytiva sales to core sales for both the baseline and current periods. Beginning in the second quarter",

From a financial performance standpoint, Cytiva contributed to a 32.0% increase in total sales, with its integration driving a 210 basis point improvement in operating profit margins due to acquisition-related fair value adjustments and cost synergies. On the capital structure front, Cytiva\u2019s operations were a key driver behind the $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for 2021, particularly for expanding biopharma manufacturing capacity. Strategically, Cytiva was central to Danaher\u2019s long-term growth plans, as evidenced by the $10.2 billion in goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition in 2020, reflecting expectations of expanded geographic reach, product diversity, and biologics workflow solutions.

In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\n\nUnder the Company's U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company's floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company's financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate.",

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million. The Company recorded an aggregate of $217 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.",

      "answer": "In 2021, BMY's provision for restructuring was $169 million, a significant decrease from $530 million in 2020. This decline aligns with the company's progress in the Celgene acquisition integration, which had achieved approximately $2.6 billion in annualized pre-tax cost savings by 2020 and was on track to reach $3.0 billion by 2022. The restructuring charges in 2020 were much higher due to ongoing exit and integration costs tied to the Celgene acquisition plan, while the 2021 figures reflect a tapering of these expenses as the integration matured.",

In 2020, BMY recorded $11.4 billion in IPRD, primarily tied to mavacamten from the MyoKardia acquisition, indicating significant upfront investment in early-stage therapies. In 2021, $1.5 billion of IPRD was reclassified to acquired marketed product rights upon the approval of Breyanzi and Abecma, showing the transition of IPRD assets into revenue-generating products. On the balance sheet, IPRD was valued at $19.5 billion in 2021, reflecting the long-term potential of these assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which forecasts future cash flows.

The fair value of short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to the short maturities of the debt instruments.\n\nIn 2019, BMS issued an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.0 billion of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes with proceeds net of discount and deferred loan issuance costs of $18.8 billion. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of BMS's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and the fixed rate notes are redeemable at any time, in whole, or in part, at varying specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Celgene  acquisition,  BMS  commenced  offers  to  exchange  outstanding  notes  issued  by  Celgene  of approximately $19.9 billion for a like-amount of new notes to be issued by BMS (the 'exchange offers'). This exchange transaction was accounted for as a modification of the assumed debt instruments. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, BMS issued approximately  $18.5  billion  of  new  notes  in  exchange  for  the  Celgene  notes  tendered  in  the  exchange  offers.  The  aggregate principal amount of Celgene notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers  was approximately $1.3 billion.\n\nIn  2019,  BMS  entered  into  an  $8.0  billion  term  loan  credit  agreement  consisting  of  a  $1.0  billion  364-day  tranche, a $4.0 billion three-year tranche and a $3.0 billion five-year tranche in connection with the Celgene acquisition. The term loan was subject to customary terms and conditions and did not have any financial covenants. The proceeds under the term loan were used to fund a portion of the cash to be paid in the Celgene acquisition and the payment of related fees and expenses. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, BMS repaid the term loan in its entirety using cash proceeds generated from the Otezla* divestiture.\n\nIn  2020,  BMS  issued  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $7.0  billion  of  fixed  rate  unsecured  senior  notes  with  proceeds  net  of discount and deferred loan issuance costs of $6.9 billion. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of BMS's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are redeemable at any time, in whole, or in part, at varying specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nIn 2021, BMS purchased aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion of certain of its debt securities for approximately $4.0 billion of cash in a series of tender offers and 'make whole' redemptions. In connection with these transactions, a $281 million loss on debt redemption was recognized based on the carrying value of the debt and included in Other (income)/expense, net.\n\nRepayment of Notes at maturity aggregated $2.0 billion in 2021, $2.8 billion in 2020 and $1.3 billion in 2019.

These  items  are  adjusted  after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration  expenses,  (iv)  restructuring  costs,  (v)  accelerated  depreciation  and  impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets, (vi) R&amp;D charges or other income resulting from up-front or contingent milestone payments in connection with the  acquisition  or  licensing  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights,  (vii)  divestiture  gains  or  losses,  (viii)  stock  compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of Celgene awards and certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the Celgene transaction, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments, including adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments and (xi) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition and the GILTI tax charge upon finalization of the Otezla* divestiture in 2020. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact  of  foreign  exchange.  We  calculate  foreign  exchange  impacts  by  converting  our  current-period  local  currency  financial results  using  the  prior  period  average  currency  rates  and  comparing  these  adjusted  amounts  to  our  current-period  results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.2 to our Form 8K filed on February 4, 2022 and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nNon-GAAP  information  is  intended  to  portray  the  results  of  our  baseline  performance,  supplement  or  enhance  management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items  that  are  considered  by  us  to  not  be  reflective  of  our  ongoing  results.  In  addition,  this  information  is  among  the  primary indicators  that  we  use  as  a  basis  for  evaluating  performance,  allocating  resources,  setting  incentive  compensation  targets  and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's exposure to economic downturns, as outlined in risk factors, reconcile with the structure of its premium revenue recognition and the segment-level dependence on CMS for 40% of total revenues?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group faces material risks from unfavorable economic conditions, as noted in the risk factors on page 17, which could reduce premium revenues due to employer cutbacks, customer cancellations, or state Medicaid reimbursement cuts. This risk is compounded by the structure of premium revenue recognition described on page 47, where fixed-rate premiums are recognized over the service period and are subject to rebates if MLRs fall below ACA thresholds, limiting short-term pricing flexibility during economic stress. Further, page 67 reveals that 40% of total revenues in 2024 came from CMS, primarily through the UnitedHealthcare segment, which includes Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014both of which are vulnerable to federal and state budgetary pressures during downturns. Thus, the company's premium revenue model and CMS dependency amplify its exposure to macroeconomic volatility, creating a structural risk in maintaining revenue stability during unfavorable economic conditions.",

For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and impair our ability to provide services to our clients and customers. In addition, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, and our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be affected and sustain a reduced capacity to handle demand for care. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enactment of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting availability of, or our ability to deliver, pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.\n\n## Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants.\n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be impaired by changes in our business practices and the terms of our relationships, including commission levels.\n\n## Our businesses are subject to risks associated with unfavorable economic conditions.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have a range of impacts on the demand for our products and services. Such conditions also have caused and in future periods could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer particular coverage on a voluntary, employeefunded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and in the premium and fee revenues we generate.\n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could constrain state and federal budgets and result in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could negatively affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results by impacting the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others.\n\n## Our failure to attract, dev elop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance.\n\nWe depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse talents, backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, to operate and expand our business. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business.

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

Certain transactions also included various put and call options, which were valued at $630 million and included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2024 the total estimated future obligation under these arrangements if the Company decided or was required to repurchase these interests was up to $3.4 billion.\n\n## 14.    Segment Financial Information\n\nFactors used to determine the Company's reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is the Chief Executive Officer, to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. The CODM uses consolidated expense information and segment earnings from operations to assess performance and determine allocation of resources.\n\nThe following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company's four reportable segments derives its revenues:\n\n- UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State. The businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage.\n- Optum Health focuses on care delivery, including value-based care; care management; wellness and consumer engagement and health financial services. Optum Health is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms.\n- Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system.\n- Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, infusion, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease and drug therapy management. Optum Rx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing.\n\nThe Company's accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management's estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital.\n\nAs a percentage of the Company's total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 40%, 40% and 38% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 99%, 97% and 97% of consolidated total revenues for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 92% and 82% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fix ed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual's international businesses.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group estimates that a 1% difference in medical costs payable as of December 31, 2024, would impact 2024 net earnings by approximately $260 million (page_36). This sensitivity reflects the materiality of accurate estimation. The company uses an actuarial process that considers factors like claim submission timing, seasonal variations, and contract rate changes to estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, with approximately 90% of claims settled within 90 days (page_48). Despite these rigorous estimation methods, the cash flow statement shows that medical costs payable decreased from $3,482 million in 2023 to $2,503 million in 2024 (page_46), indicating a downward adjustment in liabilities that may reflect either improved claims management or favorable claim resolution trends.

Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2024 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, 2024 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $260 million.\n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.",

Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is ex pected to be recognized in the nex t three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and",

      "question": "How do UnitedHealth's medical cost estimation risks in Optum Health, rising medical costs in 2024, and the financial impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack collectively shape the company's current cost management challenges?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth faces significant cost management challenges stemming from three interrelated factors. First, in its Risk Factors section, the company acknowledges that inaccurate estimation or management of medical costs\u2014particularly in Optum Health, which operates under fully accountable value-based arrangements\u2014could materially affect profitability. Second, the 2024 results show that medical costs increased due to factors like Medicare Advantage growth, member mix, and the impact of the cyberattack, which pushed up the medical care ratio (MCR), reducing net earnings margins. Third, the Change Healthcare cyberattack led to $2.2 billion in direct response costs, disrupted Optum Insight\u2019s operations by an estimated $867 million, and required interest-free loans to care providers, further straining cost control. Together, these elements create a complex environment where historical cost estimation risks are now manifesting in real financial pressures, compounded by operational disruptions.",

Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people's health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "question": "How do UnitedHealth Group's consolidated total operating costs compare with the aggregated segment-level costs across UnitedHealthcare and Optum divisions, and what does this reveal about the company's cost structure when also considering the parent company's standalone operating costs?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's consolidated total operating costs were $367,991 million in 2024 according to the income statement (page 43). This aligns with the aggregated segment-level costs from UnitedHealthcare ($282,624 million) and Optum segments ($236,254 million) minus intersegment eliminations ($150,887 million) from page 68, which also sum to $367,991 million. However, the parent company's standalone operating costs were significantly lower at $108 million in 2024 (page 79), indicating that the vast majority of operating costs reside within the operating segments rather than at the corporate level. This reveals a cost structure where segment operations drive nearly all expenses, with minimal overhead at the parent company level.",

      "answer": "The $8.3 billion loss on sale of subsidiary in 2024 is broken down into $7.1 billion from the completed sale of Brazil operations and $1.2 billion from the reclassification of remaining South American operations as held for sale. This total loss is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and reflects both the direct losses and the reclassification of cumulative foreign currency translation losses totaling $4.1 billion and $855 million, respectively. The loss is also highlighted in the cash flow statement under operating activities, indicating its material impact on operating performance despite being a non-recurring item. Strategically, these losses align with the company's deliberate exit from South American markets, which is also referenced in the segment reporting as part of broader business portfolio refinement efforts.",

      "answer": "The company uses historical rebate payments as a foundational input in estimating its $11,539.3 million sales rebate and discount accruals as of December 31, 2024. However, due to the variability in prescription drug costs and data, historical payments alone may not be predictive, requiring qualitative adjustments. This aligns with the company's broader accounting judgment framework, where significant estimates\u2014like rebate accruals\u2014require subjective assumptions and are subject to revision over multiple periods due to the six-month lag in actual rebate payments. The company also evaluates current contracts, sales trends, and regulatory changes, indicating a layered and dynamic estimation process that integrates both historical and forward-looking data to manage uncertainty in net product revenue.",

          "chunk_text": "## Description of the Matter\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate accruals\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Net\n\nProduct Revenue,' the Company establishes prov isions for sales rebate and discounts in the same period as the related sales occur. At December 31, 2024, the Company had\n\n$11,539.3 million in sales rebate and discount accruals. A large portion of these accruals are rebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is cov ered by Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\n\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the subjectiv ity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a percentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, changes in rebate contracts, an ev aluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold v ia Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. Giv en v ariability in prescription drug costs and v ariability in prescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictiv e for management to estimate the rebate accrual and thus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitativ e adjustments based upon current expectations, particularly for select products which contribute the largest portion of the Company's rev enue.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the v aluation of the sales rebate and discount liabilities. This included testing controls ov er management's rev iew of the significant assumptions used to calculate the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate liabilities, including the significant assumptions discussed above. This testing also included management's control to compare actual activ ity to estimated activ ity and controls to ensure the data used to ev aluate the significant assumptions was complete and accurate. Our audit procedures included, among others, ev aluating for reasonableness the significant assumptions in light of economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. Our testing inv olv ed assessing the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activ ity to prev ious estimates and performing analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to ev aluate the completeness of the reserv es. Additionally, our procedures included rev iewing a sample of contracts, testing a sample of rebate payments and testing the underlying data used in management's evaluation. For Medicaid, we inv olv ed our professionals with an understanding of the statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company's calculation methodologies with the applicable gov ernment regulations and policy.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 19, 2025",

We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Product Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Rev enue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receiv e payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Prov isions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are receiv ed; therefore, we generally only hav e a few days of orders receiv ed but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activ ities are considered to be fulfillment activ ities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a gov ernmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\n\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serv e pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 24 percent of consolidated rev enue. Further, they each accounted for between 21 percent and 29 percent of accounts receiv able as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\n\n## Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- We initially inv oice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may prov ide for v arious rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\n- The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and v arious other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected v alue approach.\n- The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislativ ely mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, gov ernment rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as gov ernmental authorities rev ise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.",

      "answer": "The decline in 'Collaboration and Other Revenue' from $5,310.2 million in 2023 to $4,294.8 million in 2024 suggests a reduction in revenue contributions from collaborative arrangements. This aligns with the Tyvyt collaboration, where Eli Lilly reports its share of gross margin from Innovent\u2019s third-party sales as collaboration revenue, potentially indicating lower sales or margin contributions in 2024. Additionally, the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration involves shared development and commercialization costs and performance-linked royalty adjustments, which could have led to downward revenue adjustments or increased cost obligations for Lilly in 2024, contributing to the drop in collaboration revenue.",

      "answer": "Eli Lilly's liquidity planning and capital allocation strategy directly accounts for the underfunded status of its retiree health benefit plans, as noted in its capital requirements for pension and retiree health benefits (page_51). The company plans to fund these obligations through a combination of operating cash flow, access to capital markets, and careful management of liquidity. The retiree health benefit plans are supported by $2.58 billion in assets held in trust, as detailed in the fair value measurements (page_100), which include public equity securities, fixed income, and trust-owned insurance contracts. Despite these assets, the plans remain underfunded, as disclosed on page_96, which shows that the accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets.

As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and serv ices to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, div idends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activ ities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and serv ices will be consistent with our past lev els relativ e to rev enues.\n\nCapital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making inv estments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These inv estments, and other capital inv estments that support our operations, hav e increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures ov er the next sev eral years.\n\nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we hav e entered, and expect to continue to enter, into v arious agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or serv ices primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in dev elopment, ov er the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash prov ided by operating activ ities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equiv alents, we held total inv estments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nWe paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&amp;D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. We paid $947.7 million in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of a manufacturing site in Wisconsin. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, total debt was $33.64 billion, an increase of $8.42 billion compared with $25.23 billion at December 31, 2023. In February 2025, we issued $6.5 billion of fixed-rate notes.

      "question": "How does the composition and trajectory of LLY's net product revenue reflect both the growth from core products and the impact of divestitures and licensing arrangements, particularly when comparing the quantitative revenue growth from 2022 to 2024 with the specific product-level agreements and one-time events described in the collaboration disclosures?",
      "answer": "LLY's net product revenue grew significantly from $25,462.8 million in 2022 to $40,747.9 million in 2024, indicating strong core product performance. This growth trajectory is partially explained by the one-time $300 million payment from Boehringer Ingelheim related to Jardiance, which boosted 2024 revenue. However, the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio in 2023, which included a $1.05 billion cash payment upfront and $305 million in 2024, shows that not all revenue growth came from retained products. Additionally, licensing arrangements such as those with Roche (Ebglyss), Incyte (Olumiant), and Chugai (Orforglipron) reveal that a portion of LLY's revenue is tied to royalty obligations that affect cost of sales and profitability, even though these products contribute to net product revenue. Thus, the growth in net product revenue reflects both sustained demand for key products and strategic portfolio adjustments.",

In the equity section, it reduced retained earnings by $2.1 billion and contributed $974 million to accumulated other comprehensive income, signaling a major reallocation of capital. On the comprehensive income side, the distribution helped offset prior-year losses by adding $974 million to equity, improving the overall financial cushion. In financing activities, the distribution accounted for approximately $2.6 billion of cash outflow, representing the largest single component of cash used in 2022 and highlighting the strategic nature of the transaction in reshaping Danaher\u2019s capital structure.

      "question": "What explains the significant increase in Danaher's notes payable and current portion of long-term debt from $591 million in 2022 to $1,695 million in 2023 on the balance sheet, and how does this align with both the changes in financing activities and the classification of debt in the cash flow and footnotes?",
      "answer": "The increase in notes payable and current portion of long-term debt from $591 million in 2022 to $1,695 million in 2023 on the balance sheet aligns with the $18.4 billion total debt level as of December 31, 2023, which includes short-term obligations. This increase is partially explained by the $427 million distributed to Veralto during the Separation, which likely shifted certain liabilities into current obligations. Additionally, the balance sheet reclassification of approximately $1.0 billion of euro-denominated commercial paper as long-term debt suggests that the remaining current portion reflects strategic refinancing decisions and short-term liquidity management, despite the overall decline in total debt from $19.7 billion to $18.4 billion.",

      "question": "How does Danaher's core sales decline of (10.5)% in one business segment compare to the (18.0)% decline in another, and what does this discrepancy suggest about the company's overall performance when considering the methodology used to calculate core sales growth?",
      "answer": "Danaher reports a core sales decline of (10.5)% in one segment and a significantly steeper (18.0)% decline in another, indicating uneven performance across business units. The company defines core sales growth as GAAP sales excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency translation, as noted in the methodology section. This suggests that while both segments faced headwinds, the magnitude and potential drivers differ, with the (18.0)% decline signaling more severe organic performance issues in that particular business area.",

      "answer": "The Quidel contract settlement had a multi-faceted financial impact across different reporting periods and cash flow categories. Initially, in 2021, the settlement resulted in a $547 million pretax contract settlement expense, consisting of a $5 million cash charge and a $542 million noncash charge, as disclosed on page 85. This noncash portion was also reflected in the 2021 cash flow statement under 'Contract settlement expense' (page 66). The settlement included a series of fixed payments of approximately $75 million per year through 2029, with a present value of $581 million. Of this, $576 million was classified as a noncash financing activity, and the ongoing cash payments are split between financing activities (principal repayment) and operating activities (imputed interest), as detailed on page 85. This structure means the settlement continues to affect cash flows beyond the initial expense recognition, with long-term implications for both operating and financing cash flow line items.",

        "Hop 2: DHR (page_53) \u2192 Contract Settlement Expense: The MD&A section notes that the 2022 operating cash flow increase was partly due to excluding the 2021 contract settlement expense, indicating its significance in year-over-year comparisons.",

      "answer": "The 660 basis point decline in operating profit margins for the segment on page 46 was primarily driven by lower core sales (-635 basis points), impairment charges on technology-based intangible assets (-25 basis points), and the dilutive effect of acquisitions (-5 basis points). In contrast, the overall company's operating profit margin declined by 650 basis points (from 28.3% to 21.8%), influenced by similar factors: lower core sales (-575 basis points), acquisition-related costs (-40 basis points), and impairment charges (-35 basis points). However, the segment's margin contraction was more severe due to a greater impact from core sales and product mix (-635 vs. -575 basis points), while the company-wide impact of acquisitions and impairment charges was less pronounced (-40 vs. -25 basis points). This indicates that the segment experienced more acute pressure from declining demand and cost structure inefficiencies compared to the broader company.",

      "question": "How does Merck's risk exposure related to the Bravecto product line reconcile with its reported growth in Animal Health sales and the broader financial contribution of this segment to the company's 2024 performance?",
      "answer": "Merck's Animal Health segment contributed $5.877 billion to total sales in 2024, with Bravecto alone accounting for $1.1 billion (19% of the Animal Health segment). Despite the 4% overall growth in Animal Health sales (8% excluding foreign exchange), the company highlights that a negative event involving Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on Animal Health sales. This risk is underscored by the segment's increasing significance and the complex, costly nature of biologics and vaccine production, which are key components of the Animal Health business. Thus, while Bravecto is a growth driver, its outsized role also heightens risk exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "answer": "Merck's 2024 Restructuring Program estimates $4.0 billion in cumulative pretax costs, with 60% being non-cash accelerated depreciation and the remaining 40% representing cash outflows like facility shut-down costs. In 2024, restructuring charges included $309 million in costs, which encompassed facility shut-down and accelerated depreciation expenses. These costs are excluded from non-GAAP income, as noted in the reconciliation section, which lists restructuring costs including accelerated depreciation and facility shut-down costs as adjustments. Furthermore, the company anticipates $750 million in annual net cost savings by 2031 from these restructuring actions, despite recognizing $550 million in expected charges for 2025. The long-term impact is being managed through revised asset useful lives and ongoing site closures, which are being accounted for under the 2024 Restructuring Program and reflected in both GAAP and non-GAAP reporting.",

The decline was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity and the favorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\nSignificant business development transactions in 2024 include charges of:\n\n- $1.35 billion for the acquisition of EyeBio and $100 million for a related developmental milestone\n- $750 million for the acquisition of M K-1045 (formerly CN201) from Curon\n- $656 million for the acquisition of Harpoon\n- $588 million for a global license agreement with LaNova\n- $112 million for a global license agreement with Hansoh\n\nSignificant business development transactions in 2023 include charges of:\n\n- $10.2 billion for the acquisition of Prometheus\n- $5.5 billion related to the formation of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo\n- $1.2 billion for the acquisition of Imago\n- $175 million for a license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech\n\nThe decline in R&amp;D expenses was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount) and increased clinical development spending, including for recently acquired programs.\n\nR&amp;D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by M erck  Research  Laboratories (M RL), the  Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $10.1 billion in 2024 and $9.0 billion in 2023. A lso included in R&amp;D expenses are A nimal Health research costs, upfront payments for collaboration and licensing agreements (including charges for the transactions with LaNova, Hansoh, Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun-Biotech noted above), charges for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions (including charges for the acquisitions of EyeBio, M K-1045, Harpoon, Prometheus and Imago noted above) and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&amp;D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $7.7 billion in 2024 and $20.7 billion in 2023. R&amp;D expenses also include an impairment charge of $779 million in 2023 (related to gefapixant). See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this impairment charge. The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material.\n\n## Restructuring Costs\n\nIn  January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company's  Human  Health  global  manufacturing  network  as  the  future  pipeline  shifts  to  new  modalities  and  also  optimize  the  A nimal  Health  global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency . The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially  completed  by  the  end  of  2031,  with  the  cumulative  pretax  costs  to  be  incurred  by   the  Company  to  implement  the  program  estimated  to  be approximately $4.0 billion. A pproximately 60% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company expects to record charges of approximately $550 million in 2025 related to the 2024 Restructuring Program. The Company anticipates the actions under the 2024 Restructuring Program will result in cumulative annual net cost savings of approximately $750 million by the end of 2031.\n\nIn 2019, M erck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program.\n\nRestructuring costs of $309 million in 2024 and $599 million in 2023 include separation and other costs associated with these restructuring activities. Separation costs incurred were associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for involuntary headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Other expenses in Restructuring costs include facility  shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination",

      "question": "How does Merck's treatment of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments in non-GAAP exclusions, segment profit reporting, and unallocated corporate costs collectively shape the understanding of its financial performance and operational efficiency in 2024?",
      "answer": "Merck excludes amortization of purchase accounting adjustments from both non-GAAP income and segment profits, signaling that these are considered non-operational or transitional costs. In 2024, this adjustment contributed to a $1.28 negative impact on GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. These adjustments are also excluded from segment profits and instead categorized under 'Non-segment activity,' which includes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs. This treatment ensures that segment performance, such as the 15% growth in Pharmaceutical profits and 12% growth in Animal Health profits, is not distorted by transitional accounting effects. Furthermore, the unallocated corporate reporting clarifies that these amortization costs are managed separately and not attributed to operational divisions, reinforcing that they are viewed as strategic, rather than core, financial obligations. This unified approach across disclosures shows Merck's intent to isolate one-time or non-recurring acquisition impacts to provide a clearer picture of ongoing business performance.",

      "question": "Given Lynparza's 9% revenue growth in 2024, Merck's increasing payables to AstraZeneca (from $256 million in 2023 to $713 million in 2024), and the alliance structure where Lynparza profits are calculated net of commercialization costs, what is the cash flow impact on Merck from its Lynparza partnership with AstraZeneca, and how does this affect Merck's short-term liquidity ratios?",
      "answer": "Lynparza generated $1,311 million in alliance revenue for Merck in 2024, reflecting 9% year-over-year growth (from $1,199 million in 2023). This revenue is calculated as product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, which means Merck receives a profit share rather than full gross revenue. Despite this growth, Merck's payables to AstraZeneca increased significantly from $256 million in 2023 to $713 million in 2024, indicating that rising revenue may be accompanied by higher current liabilities. This dynamic suggests that while Lynparza's performance is improving, the associated payables are growing faster than the revenue increase (which was $112 million from 2023 to 2024), potentially straining short-term liquidity. Therefore, the cash flow impact appears mixed\u2014positive from a revenue standpoint but potentially negative in terms of liquidity ratios such as the current ratio, as liabilities are rising more sharply.",

This investment strategy appears to contrast with the company's acknowledgment in its liquidity discussion of the need to fund ongoing obligations, including contributions to retiree health benefit plans, from operating cash flow and available liquidity (page_50). The reliance on volatile and less liquid asset classes raises concerns about the ability to meet near-term benefit payment obligations given the underfunded status of the plans.",

      "answer": "LLY's collaboration and other revenue grew from $2,360.5M in 2021 to $5,310.2M in 2023, more than doubling over the period. This growth aligns with revenue recognition practices described in the accounting policies, where variable consideration from collaborations\u2014such as contingent payments tied to regulatory milestones or sales performance\u2014is only recognized when it's probable that there won't be a significant reversal. For Tyvyt, LLY reports its portion of gross margin from Innovent\u2019s third-party sales as collaboration and other revenue, indicating that the growth in this line item is influenced by both the success of Tyvyt in China and LLY\u2019s conservative revenue recognition approach, which defers recognition until uncertainties around payments or obligations are resolved.",

      "answer": "The increase in LLY's sales rebates and discounts liability from $1,312.9 million in 2022 to $1,632.5 million in 2023 (as shown in the deferred tax assets table) reflects a growing accrual for rebate obligations, which aligns with the company's revenue recognition policy of estimating rebates and discounts at the time of sale (page 64). According to the revenue recognition section, LLY uses an expected value approach and considers historical rebate payments, contract terms, and sales trends to estimate these liabilities. The critical accounting estimates section (page 53) further supports this by noting that LLY believes its accruals are reasonable and appropriate, though a 5% change in the liability could impact revenue by $615 million, highlighting the sensitivity and significance of these estimates. Together, the three sections show that the increase in liability corresponds with LLY's proactive accrual methodology and underscores the financial materiality and complexity of managing rebate obligations.",

      "question": "What is the financial impact of the U.S. rebate and discount liability on LLY's net product revenue for collaborations involving Jardiance and Tyvyt, given the timing of accruals and the treatment of royalties and gross margin payments?",
      "answer": "The U.S. rebate and discount liability, which accounts for approximately 90% of LLY's total sales return, rebate, and discount liability, directly affects the timing and recognition of net product revenue. A 5% change in this liability would result in a $615 million change in revenue, impacting the reported net product revenue from collaborations such as Jardiance and Tyvyt. In the Jardiance collaboration, LLY records sales of Basaglar as net product revenue and pays a royalty to Boehringer Ingelheim, which is recorded as cost of sales. Similarly, for Tyvyt, LLY records its sales as net product revenue and pays Innovent a portion of the gross margin as cost of sales. Therefore, fluctuations in the rebate and discount accruals influence the net revenue LLY recognizes upfront, while royalty and gross margin payments further reduce the net financial benefit realized from these collaborations.",

      "answer": "The decrease in the carrying value of Acquired IPR&D from $1,871.8 million in 2022 to $966.8 million in 2023 indicates that a significant portion of the IPR&D was either written off or reclassified, likely due to project failures or milestone expensing. This aligns with the $184.0 million fair value attributed to Acquired IPR&D in the acquisition disclosure, which represents a specific component of the acquired assets. According to the accounting policy, Acquired IPR&D is expensed when development milestones are triggered, suggesting that the drop in value could be due to milestone payments being incurred or projects being abandoned, both of which would reduce the asset's carrying value on the balance sheet.",

      "answer": "The $431 million goodwill impairment charge for the LTC reporting unit in 2021 reflects the unit's deteriorating performance due to lower net facility admissions, customer losses, and the prolonged impact of the pandemic, which significantly reduced its fair value below carrying value. Despite this impairment, the Retail/LTC segment reported a $1.5 billion (24.0%) increase in adjusted operating income, driven by strong performance in areas like diagnostic testing, vaccinations, and generic drug purchasing. This contrast highlights how the broader segment was able to grow financially through pandemic-related activities, even as the LTC sub-segment faced structural and operational challenges that led to the impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.",

The resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\n(6) In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers' Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately $850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(7) In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA's risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA's minimum medical loss ratio ('MLR') rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.",

      "question": "How does the decline in CVS's generic dispensing rate across both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments in 2021 reconcile with the company's overall strategy to promote generic drug usage and its financial performance, particularly in light of increased prescription volume and adjusted operating income?",
      "answer": "CVS experienced a decline in generic dispensing rate in both the Pharmacy Services segment (from 88.2% to 86.8%) and the Retail/LTC segment (from 88.3% to 85.7%) in 2021, primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions linked to COVID-19 vaccinations. However, when excluding the impact of vaccinations, both segments saw improvements in the generic dispensing rate (88.5% for Pharmacy Services and 89.0% for Retail/LTC), indicating that the company's underlying strategy to promote generic drug usage remained effective. Despite the temporary decline in the metric, prescription volume increased by 8.4% (or 4.3% excluding vaccinations), contributing to higher total revenues. Additionally, adjusted operating income rose by $1.477 billion, or 24.0%, suggesting that the company's broader financial performance was positively influenced by factors such as improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy services, even as the generic dispensing rate dipped due to external factors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 89.0% in 2021.",

      "question": "How does the $1.4 billion store impairment charge in 2021 relate to both the Retail/LTC segment's operational performance and the broader long-lived asset impairment evaluation framework outlined in the financial statements?",
      "answer": "The $1.4 billion store impairment charge in 2021, disclosed in the Retail/LTC segment's performance section, reflects the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment tied to the planned closure of approximately 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. This charge is directly tied to the segment\u2019s operational restructuring and is recorded as part of operating expenses, impacting adjusted operating income. From a broader accounting perspective, this impairment follows the company\u2019s long-lived asset impairment policy outlined in the intangible assets section, which requires impairment testing when events indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. The impairment was triggered by the decision to close underperforming stores, leading to a write-down based on the expected future discounted cash flows of those locations. Additionally, the charge is explicitly tied to the Retail/LTC segment in the GAAP reconciliation section, reinforcing its classification and impact on segment-level financials. Together, these perspectives show that the impairment is both a strategic and accounting-driven action to align asset values with expected future performance.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

          "chunk_text": "## Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company's identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired ('VOBA'). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates.\n\nThe Company's definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary, as further described in 'LongLived Asset Impairment' below.\n\nSee Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' for additional information about intangible assets.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $231 million primarily related to operating lease right-of-use assets. See Note 6 ''Leases'' for additional information about the right-of-use asset impairment charges.\n\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill, the results of which indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of both 2020 and 2019, the Company performed its required annual goodwill impairment tests and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing dates or during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\n## Separate Accounts\n\nSeparate Accounts assets and liabilities related to large case pensions products represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders who bear the investment risk. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains and losses) accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals and net",

Definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company's acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related nonGAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\n(2) In 2021, 2020 and 2019, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. The acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment.\n\n(3) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store impairment charges related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets in connection with the planned closure of 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in 2019 and 2020. The store impairment charges are reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(4) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(5) In June 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\n(6) In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers' Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately $850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(7) In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA's risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA's minimum MLR rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.",

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's annual goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. To test the estimated fair value of the Commercial Business reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions to the reporting unit's historical results and third-party industry data. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the key assumptions. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our assessment of the methodology and significant assumptions (such as the discount rate) used by the Company. In addition, we tested management's reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. |\n| Description of the Matter                | At December 31, 2021, the incurred but not reported ('IBNR') liabilities represented $6.6 billion of $8.8 billion of health care costs payable.

The estimated IBNR liability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable.

This included, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of data used in the actuarial projections, the transfer of data between underlying source systems, and the review and approval processes that management has in place for the actuarial principles and assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |",

This development does not directly correspond to an increase in the Company's operating results as these reductions were offset by estimated current period health care costs when the Company established the estimate of the current year health care costs payable.",

      "answer": "Acquired IPRD expenses had a significant impact on BMY's 2024 operating margin, increasing by $12.46 billion year-over-year to a total of $13.373 billion in 2024. This increase was primarily driven by a $900 million IPRD impairment charge related to the Mirati acquisition, as noted in the R&D section. Additionally, the upfront costs from the 2022 acquisition of Turning Point, which included a $100 million payment expensed to Acquired IPRD, contributed to this expense growth. These charges directly impacted the company's operating margin, contributing to a loss before income taxes of $8,379 million in 2024, compared to earnings of $8,440 million in 2023.",

      "answer": "BMY's total consideration allocated increases from $3,873 million on page 92 to $4,935 million on both pages 93 and 94. On page 92, $296 million was allocated to equity awards, but this decreases to $205 million on page 93. Additionally, page 93 introduces a new component \u2014 the fair value of CVRs at $248 million \u2014 which contributes to the higher total consideration. Meanwhile, page 94 reflects the final allocation, including $4,225 million to intangible assets and $152 million to goodwill, showing how the initial cash and award figures from earlier tables translate into post-acquisition accounting.",

      "answer": "BMY spent $13,373 million on Acquired IPRD in 2024, driven by the $12,122 million Karuna asset acquisition. This significant investment aligns with their accounting policy where IPRD assets with no alternative future use are expensed upon acquisition. However, BMY also acknowledges in their impairment review process that newly acquired IPRD assets are 'highly vulnerable to impairment charges' due to risks such as changes in competitive landscape, regulatory delays, or adverse clinical results. Furthermore, BMY tests IPRD for impairment annually or more frequently if triggering events occur, using discounted after-tax cash flow projections, which are sensitive to changes in assumptions about future revenues, probabilities of success, and discount rates. Given that BMY recorded $2.9 billion in impairment charges in 2024\u2014significantly higher than the $136 million in 2023\u2014it raises concerns about the sustainability of value from large IPRD acquisitions like Karuna, especially in light of the company's own risk disclosures around such assets.",

          "chunk_text": "- Identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;\n- Estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;\n- Eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;\n- Probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;\n- Resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;\n- Timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;\n- Appropriate discount rate by products;\n- Market participant income tax rates; and\n- Allocation of expected synergies to products.\n\nWe believe the fair value used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Impairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets, including Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nLong-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  may  not  be  recoverable  or  at  least  annually  for  G oodwill  and  IPRD.  Intangible  assets  are  highly  vulnerable  to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets ex ceeds its fair value, then the asset is writtendown to its fair value. Ex pectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets are subjective and require significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold, Research and development, and Other (income)/expense, net were $2.9 billion in 2024, $136 million in 2023 and $101 million in 2022. Refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nValuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $8.4 billion at December 31, 2024 (net of valuation allowance of $929 million) and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023 (net of valuation allowance of $764 million).\n\nThe U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2024. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).\n\nLiabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain ex penses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for tax es ultimately ex pected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.\n\nFor discussions on income taxes, refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards-Income Taxes' and '-Note 7. Income Taxes.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Acquisitions\n\nBusinesses acquired are consolidated upon obtaining control. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.  Contingent  consideration  from  potential  development,  regulatory,  approval  and  sales-based  milestones  and  sales-based  royalties  are  included  in  the purchase price for business combinations and excluded for asset acquisitions.\n\nIf the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, primarily because no significant processes were acquired or substantially all of the relative fair value was allocated to a single asset, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and no goodwill is recorded. In addition, in an asset acquisition, acquired in-process research and development (\"IPRD\") assets with no alternative future use are expensed to Acquired IPRD.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nThe fair value of acquired intangible assets is determined using an income-based approach referred to as the excess earnings method utilizing Level 3 fair value inputs. Market participant valuations assume a global view considering all potential jurisdictions and indications based on discounted after-tax cash flow projections, risk adjusted for estimated probability of technical and regulatory success.\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including acquired marketed product rights and R&amp;D technology are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment  when  facts  or  circumstances  suggest  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  the  carrying  value  ex ceeds  the  projected undiscounted pretax cash flows of the intangible asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value (discounted after-tax cash flows) is recognized.\n\nGoodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net assets is below their carrying amounts. Examples of qualitative factors assessed include BMS's share price, financial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in a prior year. Each relevant factor is assessed both individually and in the aggregate.\n\nIPRD is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. Impairment charges are recognized to the extent the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed its fair value.",

      "answer": "BMY's Marketing, Selling and Administrative expenses rose sharply from $94 million in 2023 to $422 million in 2024. This increase is partially explained by the expensing of $130 million in cash-settled unvested equity awards tied to general marketing and selling functions (page 92), and an additional $60 million in similar expenses related to the RayzeBio acquisition (page 93).

Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus ('HBV') and HDV products.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Truvada  and  Atripla  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&amp;D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and  other  investments  that  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with  Arcus,  Pionyr  Immunotherapeutics,  Inc.  ('Pionyr'),  Tango Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tango'), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tizona') and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. ('Jounce').\n\n## Strategy and Outlook 2022\n\nOur  purpose  is  to  deliver  life-changing  medications  to  patients  in  need  through  scientific  breakthroughs,  innovation  and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.",

      "answer": "The significant growth in Trodelvy sales from $49 million in 2020 to $380 million in 2021, as shown in the financial data, aligns with Gilead's strategic priorities of expanding innovation and delivering transformative therapies, as mentioned in the Strategy and Outlook section. This growth was driven by the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the U.S. and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the U.S., which contributed to Trodelvy's inclusion among the key growth drivers (alongside Biktarvy, Veklury, and cell therapy products) for the 11% total revenue increase in 2021. The sales growth also reflects the impact of the acquisition of Immunomedics in late 2020, which brought Trodelvy into Gilead\u2019s portfolio and contributed to the company's broader innovation and portfolio strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus ('HBV') and HDV products.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Truvada  and  Atripla  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&amp;D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and  other  investments  that  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with  Arcus,  Pionyr  Immunotherapeutics,  Inc.  ('Pionyr'),  Tango Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tango'), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tizona') and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. ('Jounce').\n\n## Strategy and Outlook 2022\n\nOur  purpose  is  to  deliver  life-changing  medications  to  patients  in  need  through  scientific  breakthroughs,  innovation  and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.",

      "question": "How did the changes in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2021, specifically the $14.4 billion total deductions, relate to the estimation methodologies described in the financial reporting sections, and how were these deductions impacted by the significant increase in Veklury sales during the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2021, GILD reported gross-to-net deductions totaling $14.4 billion, representing 35% of gross product sales, a decrease from 39% in 2020. This reduction was primarily driven by changes in product mix, most notably the significant increase in Veklury sales, which rose from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $5.6 billion in 2021. Veklury, being a newer product with fewer legacy rebate programs compared to older HIV treatments like Truvada, likely contributed to a lower proportion of deductions relative to sales. The estimation of these deductions, including government rebates and chargebacks, is based on a range of factors such as historical payer mix, statutory discount requirements, and market research. These methodologies, detailed in the financial reporting sections, underscore the complexity of estimating deductions in real time, especially when sales dynamics shift significantly due to external factors like the pandemic and the associated surge in demand for Veklury. Thus, the interplay between Veklury's rapid sales growth and the structured estimation process directly influenced the gross-to-net deduction percentage.",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers, generally upon shipment or delivery, to the customer, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. The revenues are recognized net of estimated  government  and  other  rebates  and  chargebacks,  cash  discounts  for  prompt  payment,  distributor  fees,  sales  return provisions  and  other  related  deductions.  These  deductions  to  product  sales  are  referred  to  as  gross-to-net  deductions  and  are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from  30  to  90  days;  however,  payment  terms  differ  by  jurisdiction,  by  customer  and,  in  some  instances,  by  type  of  product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative  revenue  recognized  is  not  probable  of  occurring  when  the  uncertainty  associated  with  gross-to-net  deductions  is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less, we do not adjust the amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nGovernment and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts payable to payers and healthcare providers under various programs,  and  may  vary  by  product,  by  payer  and  individual  payer  plans.  Rebates  and  chargebacks  are  based  on  contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing our estimates, we consider: historical and estimated payer mix; statutory discount requirements and contractual terms; historical claims experience and processing time lags; estimated patient population; known market events or trends; market research; channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and other pertinent internal or external information. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nGovernment and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government and other rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical customer payment patterns and our expectations regarding future customer payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder our inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers, we pay the wholesalers a fee primarily for compliance with certain contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances  are  made  for  estimated  sales  returns  by  our  customers  and  are  recorded  in  the  period  the  related  revenue  is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the United States, we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the United States, returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and not considered to be a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "answer": "Gilead's Acquired IPR&D expenses dropped from $5,856 million in 2020 to $177 million in 2021, a 97% decrease, indicating a major reduction in one-time costs related to in-process research and development. This sharp decline aligns with the company's recognition of a prior impairment charge of $800 million in 2019 related to IPR&D for axicabtagene ciloleucel, which had reduced the fair value of the asset below carrying value and was also recorded under Acquired IPR&D expenses. Additionally, the company clarified in its financial statement policies that beginning in 2020, Acquired IPR&D expenses are presented separately from ongoing R&D expenses, which explains the transparency in the line-item decline and reflects a shift in how these costs are accounted for and disclosed in the consolidated income statement.",

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Overview\n\nGilead  Sciences,  Inc.  ('Gilead,'  'we,'  'our'  or  'us')  is  a  biopharmaceutical  company  that  has  pursued  and  achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people. We are committed to  advancing  innovative  medicines  to  prevent  and  treat  life-threatening  diseases,  including  HIV ,  viral  hepatitis  and  cancer.  We operate in more than 35 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California.\n\nOur portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome , Atripla , Biktarvy , Cayston , Complera , Descovy , Descovy for PrEP , Emtriva , Epclusa , Eviplera , Genvoya , Harvoni , Hepcludex (bulevirtide), Hepsera , Jyseleca (filgotinib), Letairis , Odefsey ,  Ranexa ,  Sovaldi ,  Stribild ,  Tecartus ,  Trodelvy ,  Truvada ,  Truvada  for  PrEP ,  Tybost ,  Veklury ,  Vemlidy , Viread ,  V osevi ,  Yescarta and  Zydelig .  The  approval  status  of  Hepcludex  and  Jyseleca  vary  worldwide,  and  Hepcludex  and Jyseleca are not approved in the United States. We also sell and distribute authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, we sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under collaborative agreements. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Gilead, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than 100% of the economics, we record net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties.\n\nWe assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ('VIE') at the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date. This assessment is based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We did not have any material VIEs as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation. Beginning 2020, acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') expenses are reported  separately  from  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  Our  Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was conformed to separately present acquired IPR&amp;D expenses.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe have one operating segment which primarily focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines  in  areas  of  unmet  medical  need.  Our  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  the  chief  operating  decision-maker  ('CODM'), manages and allocates resources to the operations of our company on an entity-wide basis. Managing and allocating resources on an entity-wide basis enables our CODM to assess the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across  functions  and  research  and  development  ('R&amp;D')  projects  based  on  unmet  medical  need  and,  as  necessary,  reallocate resources among our internal R&amp;D portfolio and external opportunities to best support the long-term growth of our business. See Note 2. Revenues for a summary of disaggregated revenues by product and geographic region.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\n\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our significant accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical  experience  and  on  various  market-specific  and  other  relevant  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, such as the economic considerations related to the impact that the coronavirus disease ('COVID-19') could have on our significant accounting estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.",

The net option charge of $625 million was recorded within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The collaboration opt-in payments of $725 million were recorded in Accrued and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  paid  to Arcus  in  January  2022.  Our  payments  to Arcus  will  be  included  within  Net  cash provided by investing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the first quarter of 2022. Under the amended Collaboration  Agreement,  the  companies  will  co-develop  and  share  the  global  costs  related  to  these  clinical  programs.  If  the optioned molecules achieve regulatory approval, the companies will co-commercialize and equally share profits in the U.S. Gilead will hold exclusive commercialization rights outside the U.S., subject to any rights of Arcus's existing collaboration partners, and will pay to Arcus tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales ranging from the mid-teens and low twenties. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we may also pay an additional $100 million at our option on each of the fourth, sixth and eighth anniversaries of the agreement, unless terminated early, to maintain the rights to opt-in to future Arcus programs for the duration of the contact term.\n\nWe elected and applied the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Arcus whereby the investment is marked to  market  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  market  price  of Arcus  shares.  We  believe  the  fair  value  option  best  reflects  the underlying economics of the investment. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded pre-tax unrealized gains  of  $127  million  and  $80  million,  respectively,  related  to  our  investment  in Arcus  in  Other  income  (expense),  net  on  our Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  We  initially  recorded  our  equity  investments  in  Arcus  in  Other  long-term  assets  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets as the investments were subject to contractual lock-up provisions for a period of two years from the closing date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, subject to certain conditions. In the third quarter of 2021, we reclassified our equity investments in Arcus to Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as the contractual lock-up provisions are expected to expire in July 2022. Our equity investment in Arcus was $559 million and $212 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Pionyr\n\nOn June 19, 2020, we entered into a transaction with Pionyr, a privately held company pursuing novel biology in the field of immuno-oncology, which included entry into two separate merger agreements, one contemplating the initial acquisition of a 49.9% equity interest in Pionyr, and the other providing us the exclusive option, subject to certain terms and conditions, to acquire the remaining  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Pionyr  (together,  the  'Pionyr  Merger  and  Option  Agreements')  and  a  research  and development service agreement.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, we closed the transaction and made cash payments of $269 million. We account for our investment in Pionyr  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting  because  our  equity  interest  provides  us  with  the  ability  to  exercise  significant influence over Pionyr. Our investment in Pionyr, consisting of the transaction price noted above and transaction costs, exceeded our pro-rata portion of Pionyr's net assets at transaction closing. We determined that the resulting basis difference primarily relates to Pionyr's  IPR&amp;D  which  has  no  alternative  future  use  and  that  Pionyr  is  not  a  business  as  defined  in  ASC  805,  'Business Combinations.' As a result, we immediately recorded a charge for this basis difference of $215 million in Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our equity method investment in Pionyr was zero as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe estimated fair value of our exclusive option to acquire the remaining outstanding capital stock of Pionyr is approximately $70 million based on a probability-weighted option pricing model using unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 under the  fair  value  measurement  and  disclosure  guidance.  The  estimated  amount  is  recorded  in  Other  long-term  assets  on  our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  may  choose  to  exercise  our  exclusive  option  to  purchase  the  remaining  equity  interest  from Pionyr's current shareholders for a $315 million option exercise fee and up to $1.2 billion in potential future milestone payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Such option to purchase will expire following the earliest occurrence of specified events, including the delivery of data following completion of certain Phase 1b trials by Pionyr.\n\nUnder the research and development service agreement, we made an initial cash funding of $80 million and recorded a charge in  Acquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we committed to provide additional payments of up to $115 million to Pionyr upon achievement of certain development milestones. We accrued $70 million in milestone payments, related to the initiation of two Phase 1 studies, with a charge to Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020, and the payment was made in the first quarter of 2021.",

      "question": "How does the $94 million expense related to voluntary early retirement packages in fiscal year 2023 impact both the restructuring charges and the funded status of Medtronic's retirement benefit plans, and why is this cost excluded from the restructuring charges table despite being a significant pension-related liability?",
      "answer": "The $94 million expense associated with voluntary early retirement packages in fiscal year 2023 is included in restructuring charges, net, on the consolidated statements of income, but it is explicitly excluded from the restructuring charges table because it falls under pension and post-retirement accounting rules. This cost is also part of the broader $494 million net expense for retirement benefit plans in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, this charge contributes to the funded status of the benefit plans, which was $484 million overfunded as of April 26, 2024, up from $103 million overfunded in the prior year. The exclusion from the restructuring table reflects different accounting treatments for pension-related obligations, even though they are triggered by restructuring initiatives.",

        "Hop 1: MDT(page_69) \u2192 Voluntary Early Retirement Packages: The $94 million expense is disclosed as part of restructuring charges, net, but its nature as a pension-related cost is only briefly mentioned.",
        "Hop 2: MDT(page_70) \u2192 Voluntary Early Retirement Packages: The exclusion of this $94 million from the restructuring charges table is clarified, citing that it is governed by pension and post-retirement accounting standards.",
        "Hop 3: MDT(page_91) \u2192 Voluntary Early Retirement Packages: The expense is contextualized within the broader retirement benefit plans, showing it contributes to the $494 million net expense in 2023 and impacts the overfunded status of the plans."

      "answer": "Medtronic's treatment of acquisition and divestiture-related items in its GAAP-to-Non-GAAP reconciliation shows a consistent yet evolving approach across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024. In FY2022, the company adjusted $838 million of such items to arrive at Non-GAAP net income, whereas in FY2023, this adjustment dropped to $345 million, and in FY2024, it increased significantly to $777 million. This fluctuation suggests varying levels of acquisition/divestiture activity and differing impacts on GAAP earnings over time. The increase in FY2024 indicates a potential uptick in M&A activity or related costs, while the lower amount in FY2023 may reflect a quieter year for such events. The company's transparency in clearly itemizing these adjustments across all three years supports a consistent reporting framework, though the magnitude of the FY2024 adjustment raises questions about the scale of recent transactions or integration costs.",

      "question": "How does the trend in Medtronic's restructuring and associated costs from fiscal year 2022 to 2024 reflect in both their GAAP and Non-GAAP adjustments, and what does this imply about the company's ongoing operational transformation and financial impact?",
      "answer": "Medtronic's restructuring and associated costs decreased from $647 million in fiscal 2023 to $389 million in fiscal 2024, while the associated tax benefits in Non-GAAP adjustments also declined from $139 million to $66 million. This downward trend suggests that the company may be nearing the later stages of its restructuring initiatives, with reduced costs translating into lower adjustments and potentially stabilizing operations. However, the continued presence of these costs in both GAAP and Non-GAAP reporting indicates that restructuring remains a material factor affecting both profitability and earnings per share.",

        "Hop 1: MDT(page_104) \u2192 Restructuring and associated costs: The GAAP income statement shows restructuring and associated costs of $647 million in fiscal 2023 and $389 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a significant year-over-year decline.",
        "Hop 2: MDT(page_34) \u2192 Restructuring and associated costs: In fiscal 2023, restructuring and associated costs of $647 million contributed to Non-GAAP adjustments, with a corresponding tax benefit of $139 million, impacting net income and diluted EPS.",
        "Hop 3: MDT(page_33) \u2192 Restructuring and associated costs: In fiscal 2024, restructuring and associated costs were $389 million, with a smaller tax benefit of $66 million, showing a reduced financial impact compared to the prior year."

      "question": "How does the restructuring of Medtronic's Medical Surgical segment, particularly the formation and repositioning of the Acute Care & Monitoring division, reflect in both the financial reporting structure and strategic product portfolio decisions, especially following the exit from the ventilator product line?",
      "answer": "The restructuring of Medtronic\u2019s Medical Surgical segment is evident in the financial reporting structure through the consolidation of the retained PMRI businesses into the Acute Care & Monitoring division, as noted in the recast prior-period revenue in the financial statements (page 64). Strategically, this division now focuses on patient monitoring and airway management, with key products like Nellcor pulse oximetry monitors and Bispectral Index (BIS) brain monitoring technology, following the decision to exit the ventilator product line in February 2024 (page 10). The new reporting structure aligns with this strategic shift, as reflected in the net sales by segment for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, which now categorizes Acute Care & Monitoring as a distinct business unit within Medical Surgical (page 35).",

      "question": "How does the $7.4 billion operational decline in emerging markets driven by Paxlovid revenue declines, combined with post-pandemic demand risks and competitive pressures on Pfizer's top products, shape the company's overall revenue concentration risk?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's emerging markets revenues declined by $7.4 billion operationally in 2023, with Paxlovid being a primary driver of this drop. This decline is compounded by the risks outlined in the risk factors section, which highlights that post-pandemic demand for Paxlovid and Comirnaty has decreased substantially, with expectations for 2024 to be even lower. Furthermore, the competitive pressures described in the Competitive Products section indicate that top products like Paxlovid face challenges from market entrants offering lower prices or better features, which could further erode revenues. Given that Pfizer's top nine products, including Paxlovid, accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2023, the combination of these factors significantly increases the company's revenue concentration risk, especially if demand for key products continues to decline without offsetting growth elsewhere.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PFE](page_42) \u2192 [Paxlovid Revenue]: The operational decline of $7.4 billion in emerging markets revenues was primarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty, signaling a significant drop in a major revenue contributor.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](page_8) \u2192 [Paxlovid Revenue]: Risks related to the post-pandemic transition indicate that demand for Paxlovid and Comirnaty has decreased substantially, with expectations for 2024 revenues to be lower than 2023, increasing uncertainty around revenue stability.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](page_23) \u2192 [Paxlovid Revenue]: Competitive pressures on top products, including the potential for lower pricing or superior alternatives from competitors, could further reduce Paxlovid\u2019s revenue, exacerbating the risk from revenue concentration in a shrinking market."

      "question": "Given the decline in Comirnaty revenue, how does Pfizer's exposure to foreign exchange risk, inventory write-offs, and concentration risk collectively impact its financial outlook and strategic planning for 2024?",
      "answer": "The decline in Comirnaty revenue, which accounted for 19% of Pfizer's total revenues in 2023, was exacerbated by a $7.4 billion operational decrease in emerging markets, driven in part by lower demand for Comirnaty and Paxlovid. This decline was further impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations, which contributed an additional 3% unfavorable impact. Additionally, Comirnaty and Paxlovid's reduced demand in a post-pandemic market led to significant inventory write-offs in 2023, with expectations of potential future write-offs. Pfizer also faces concentration risk, as Comirnaty alone represented a substantial portion of total revenue, making the company vulnerable to further declines in demand, competitive pressures, or supply chain disruptions. These factors have led Pfizer to lower its expectations for total COVID-19 product revenues in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling a strategic shift in reliance on these products and increased focus on diversification and business development opportunities.",

      "question": "How did the $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal related to Paxlovid impact Pfizer's total revenue performance in 2023, and what does this reveal about the broader commercial transition of the product from government to traditional markets?",
      "answer": "The $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 significantly contributed to the $41.8 billion (42%) overall decline in Pfizer's total revenues compared to 2022. This reversal was tied to the expected return of 6.5 million treatment courses of EUA-labeled Paxlovid from U.S. government inventory as part of the transition to traditional commercial markets. Despite this reduction, the company ensured commercial readiness by providing NDA-labeled supply by year-end 2023. However, minimal uptake of the commercial product occurred before January 2024 due to the continued availability of EUA-labeled doses at no cost to eligible patients through the end of 2023. This highlights the operational complexity of shifting from a government-led distribution model to a traditional commercial framework, especially as Pfizer also recognized revenue on an estimated 7.5 million treatment courses to be delivered under a patient assistance program and national stockpile initiative, with no remaining cash consideration for these doses.",

        "Hop 2: [PFE](page_37) \u2192 [Non-Cash Revenue Reversal]: Notes that this reversal was a key component of the $41.8 billion (41%) operational revenue decline year-over-year, despite growth from other products like Abrysvo and Nurtec ODT.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of developed technology rights in Pfizer's intangible asset disclosures reflect both the ongoing amortization burden and impairment risk, especially considering their classification as finite-lived assets, fair value estimates, and future amortization expectations?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's developed technology rights are disclosed as a major component of finite-lived intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of $99,267 million as of December 31, 2023, and accumulated amortization of $60,493 million, resulting in a net value of $38,773 million. These assets are subject to amortization over a weighted-average life of approximately 11 years. Additionally, the fair value of developed technology rights was $1,942 million as of December 31, 2023, with an impairment charge of $1,184 million recorded during the year. This indicates that while these rights are substantial in book value, they also carry meaningful impairment risk. The future amortization schedule further shows that these rights will continue to impact financial performance through recurring amortization expenses, aligning with their classification and expected useful life.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PFE (page_91) \u2192 Developed Technology Rights: Discloses the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net value of developed technology rights as part of finite-lived intangible assets, with a weighted-average life of 11 years.",

        "Hop 3: PFE (page_92) \u2192 Developed Technology Rights: Explains the accounting treatment, noting that developed technology rights are amortized over their useful life and that future amortization will continue based on their classification as finite-lived assets."

      "question": "How does Pfizer's treatment of 'Other (income)/deductions-net' in collaborative arrangements align with its historical financial performance and restructuring-related gains or losses recorded in the same metric?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's 'Other (income)/deductions-net' includes both income from collaborative arrangements, such as milestone payments and royalty income, and restructuring-related gains or losses. In 2023, this metric totaled $630 million, a decline from $664 million in 2022 and $820 million in 2021. The decline reflects reduced gains from equity securities and restructuring activities, such as the $1.6 billion net gain in 2023 compared to a $1.3 billion net loss in 2022. This shows that while collaborative arrangement income contributes positively to this line item, restructuring charges and asset revaluations significantly influence its volatility over time.",

      "question": "How does Thermo Fisher Scientific's $67 million currency transaction loss in 2022 relate to its $91 million foreign exchange tax benefit from intercompany debt refinancing, and what does this reveal about the geographic or strategic alignment of its FX risk management and tax planning activities?",
      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific reported a $67 million currency transaction loss in 2022 from derivative instruments used to manage foreign currency risks (page_51). This loss contrasts with a $91 million foreign exchange tax benefit recorded in 2023, which stemmed from an intercompany debt refinancing transaction (page_22). The coexistence of these two figures suggests that while the company actively hedges its foreign exchange exposures using derivatives, certain intercompany financing activities may create opportunities for tax benefits when currency fluctuations occur. This interplay indicates a strategic alignment between its FX risk management and tax planning, where specific refinancing actions may be timed or structured to capitalize on currency movements for tax optimization. Furthermore, the company\u2019s use of cross-currency interest rate swaps as part of its net investment hedging strategy (page_43) reinforces a broader framework where foreign exchange exposures are not only mitigated but also leveraged for financial and tax advantages.",

      "answer": "The Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment generated $23,041 million in revenue in 2023, a slight increase from $22,511 million in 2022. However, the segment's capital expenditures dropped significantly to $1,013 million in 2023 from $1,403 million in 2022, while its asset base remained relatively stable at $51,091 million in 2023 compared to $51,281 million in 2022. This suggests that the segment maintained its revenue growth despite reducing capital spending, potentially indicating improved efficiency or underutilized assets.",

      "answer": "Life Sciences Solutions saw a significant revenue drop from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023. This decline was accompanied by a sharp reduction in capital expenditures, falling from $810 million in 2021 to $178 million in 2023, indicating reduced investment in the segment. At the same time, the segment bore a notable share of restructuring charges, with $105 million in 2023\u2014more than any other segment in absolute terms\u2014suggesting active cost-cutting or reorganization efforts. Together, these trends point to a strategic retrenchment or refocusing within Life Sciences Solutions, marked by declining performance, reduced investment, and significant restructuring.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

However, as a result of the pandemic's impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company's other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nConditions were strong in each of the company's end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company's role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.

      "answer": "TMO's domestic pension benefits show a funded status deficit of $34 million in 2021 (down from $35 million in 2020), indicating a slightly improved but still underfunded position. The benefit obligation at the end of 2021 was $1,260 million, a decrease from $1,302 million in 2020, driven by $85 million in benefits paid and a $20 million actuarial gain. Despite this, the expected benefit payments over the next five years total $440 million, with $93 million due in 2022 alone.

      "question": "What does TMO's financial performance reveal about the profitability challenges of its Specialty Diagnostics segment despite its consistent revenue contributions?",
      "answer": "Despite Specialty Diagnostics contributing $5.7 billion in revenues in 2021 (up from $5.3 billion in 2020), the segment reported only $18 million in profit in 2021 (up from $9 million in 2020), indicating narrow margins. This low profitability contrasts sharply with the segment's significant revenue base and suggests high operating costs or pricing pressures. The operational description highlights that the segment provides a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, and instruments used in healthcare and clinical settings, which typically require ongoing R&D, regulatory compliance, and competitive pricing\u2014all potential factors in the segment\u2019s limited profitability. This dynamic suggests that while the segment is strategically important and growing in revenue, it may be under pressure to improve margins.",

      "answer": "Despite Life Sciences Solutions contributing $9.6 billion in revenue in 2024 (slightly down from $9.98 billion in 2023), its operating income dropped to $69 million from $105 million, indicating margin pressure. This decline may be linked to the strategic acquisition of Olink Holding AB in July 2024, which likely introduced integration costs and investment in growth initiatives, affecting short-term profitability while positioning the segment for long-term gains in the proteomics market.",

Acquisitions\n\nThe company's acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, primarily due to ex pectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses and the benefits that will be gained from the assembled workforces. These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company's existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses' products and services; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products and services.\n\nAcquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired companies' results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Acquisition transaction costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative ex penses as incurred.\n\n## 2024\n\nOn July 10, 2024, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Olink Holding AB (publ), a Swedish-based provider of next-generation proteomics solutions. The acquisition enhances the segment's capabilities in the high-growth proteomics market with the addition of highly differentiated solutions. It also complements the existing life sciences and mass spectrometry offerings, accelerating protein biomarker discovery and providing strong synergy opportunities. The goodwill recorded as a result of this business combination is not tax deductible.\n\nThe components of the purchase price and net assets acquired are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Cybersecurity threats, as noted on page 23, could result in financial costs and regulatory action due to breaches or incidents impacting the company's information systems or those of third-party providers. The company acknowledges that increasing use of AI could exacerbate these risks, and while it maintains cybersecurity insurance, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses. On page 6, supply chain risks are described as potentially leading to business interruptions, product shortages, and financial costs due to IT system breaches or disruptions in global logistics and production. These interruptions are explicitly tied to financial impacts, including potential regulatory consequences. Page 21 outlines climate-related risks, noting that extreme weather events or regulatory changes around greenhouse gas emissions could increase operational costs\u2014such as sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution\u2014and affect water availability, directly impacting the company's financial condition. Together, these sections reveal that J&J faces a multi-dimensional exposure to financial costs stemming from operational vulnerabilities and regulatory pressures across distinct risk categories.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's $7 billion charge related to talc matters in fiscal 2023 is consistently identified across multiple sections of the 10-K. In the quarterly results (page 111), a $6.9 billion charge is explicitly attributed to talc matters in the fiscal first quarter. This aligns with the segment reporting (page 93), where the $7 billion charge is listed under amounts not allocated to segments, indicating it is a corporate-level item tied to legal liabilities rather than operational performance. Additionally, the consolidated financial statement note (page 37) confirms the $7.0 billion charge, reinforcing its significance as a non-operational, general corporate expense. Together, these perspectives show the charge is a major legal cost impacting overall earnings but not tied to any specific business segment or recurring corporate income.",

      "question": "How does JNJ's increased R&D investment in 2023 align with its strategic refocusing on MedTech following the Consumer Health spin-off, particularly in relation to its stated goal of delivering smarter and less invasive treatments?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's increased R&D investment of $15.1 billion in 2023 aligns with its strategic refocusing on the MedTech segment following the Consumer Health spin-off in Q3 2023. The MedTech segment, which includes Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions, and Vision products, saw sales rise to $3,122 million in 2023 from $2,493 million in 2022, indicating a growing emphasis on this business area. This growth is supported by the company\u2019s commitment to innovation and its purpose of delivering treatments that are 'smarter and less invasive,' as stated in the MD&A section. The spin-off allowed JNJ to streamline its operations into two focused segments\u2014I Innovative Medicine and MedTech\u2014enabling greater investment and strategic alignment with its long-term goal of impacting health through advanced medical solutions.",

      "answer": "Innovative Medicine is positioned as a key driver of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s innovation strategy, with a focus on therapeutic areas like Immunology, Oncology, and Neuroscience, and accounted for $11,963 million in 2023 sales, representing 21.8% of total sales. This aligns with the company's strategic emphasis on innovation and R&D investment, as highlighted in the MD&A section, where $15.1 billion was invested in R&D in 2023, with Innovative Medicine playing a central role. The segment\u2019s prominence was further reinforced following the separation of the Consumer Health business in Q3 2023, which restructured the company to focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech as its two core segments, reflecting a strategic realignment toward high-impact therapeutic innovation.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's 14% increase in earnings from operations reconcile with the mixed operating margin trends across business segments and the overall 15% revenue growth reported in the consolidated results?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group reported a 14% increase in earnings from operations, driven by strong performance in both UnitedHealthcare ($16,415 million, up 14%) and Optum ($15,943 million, up 13%). However, this growth occurred alongside mixed operating margin trends\u2014UnitedHealthcare maintained a stable 5.8% margin, while Optum Health's margin declined from 8.5% to 6.9%, and Optum Insight's margin dropped from 24.6% to 22.5%. The consolidated operating margin slightly declined from 8.8% to 8.7%, despite the 15% revenue growth ($47.46 billion increase) and strong earnings growth. This suggests that while top-line expansion was robust, margin pressures in key Optum segments partially offset bottom-line gains, indicating a nuanced relationship between revenue growth and operational efficiency.",

      "answer": "The significant increase in Other Expense, Net from $2,448 million in 2022 to $4,677 million in 2023 is primarily driven by a $5.1 billion charge in 2023 related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the DJS acquisition, specifically tied to higher estimated Skyrizi sales, the passage of time, and lower discount rates. This aligns with the detailed explanation in the footnotes where the fair value adjustments are recorded in Other Expense, Net.

      "answer": "Abbott's remaining transition tax obligation under the TCJA is reported at $598 million as of December 31, 2023, and is expected to be paid over the next three years. This aligns with the $430 million transition tax liability disclosed in the reconciliation of net unrecognized tax benefits, indicating that a significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits are tied to the TCJA's transition tax. Additionally, Abbott maintains a strategy of indefinitely reinvesting undistributed foreign earnings, which reduces the need to repatriate funds to cover the transition tax liability. The company is also actively contesting IRS adjustments related to income reallocation, which could impact its overall tax position and the ultimate realization of its unrecognized tax benefits. This shows a coordinated approach where Abbott balances its known TCJA obligations with strategic tax planning and dispute resolution to manage its global tax burden.",

      "answer": "Abbott is supporting its 10.9% sales growth in Established Pharmaceuticals in emerging markets through strategic capital investment and a focused R&D approach. In 2023, the company invested $185 million in additions to property and equipment for the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, indicating infrastructure and production capacity expansion. Additionally, the R&D strategy for this segment emphasizes geographic expansion and continuous improvement of existing products, rather than primary research, with development often beginning with work on existing products or advanced-stage licensing opportunities. This approach enables Abbott to efficiently adapt its offerings to local market needs in emerging economies like India, Vietnam, and Brazil, where sales growth has been particularly strong.",

      "question": "What is the full financial and strategic context of Abbott's Nutritional Products segment, considering its goodwill allocation, impairment charges, and competitive positioning relative to other business lines?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Nutritional Products segment had $285 million in allocated goodwill as of December 31, 2023, a small portion of the company's total $23.7 billion in goodwill. In 2022, the segment was impacted by a $176 million charge related to a voluntary recall, as noted in the 'Other, net' expenses section. Strategically, the Nutritional Products segment faces competition from diversified consumer and healthcare manufacturers, with competitive factors including formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, and ingredient innovation. This contrasts with the Medical Devices segment, which highlights a broad portfolio of technologically advanced products like leadless pacemakers, glucose monitoring systems, and structural heart devices. The relatively low goodwill and specific impairment/recall-related charges suggest the Nutritional segment is less capital-intensive and more exposed to operational and market execution risks compared to the innovation-driven and higher-goodwill Medical Devices segment.",

      "answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on DHR's performance in 2024 varied across business units. One unit reported a 0.5% benefit from currency exchange rates, while another unit showed a larger benefit of 1.5% during the same period. This suggests differing exposures to foreign exchange movements, potentially due to geographic revenue mix or hedging strategies. A third unit also recorded a 1.0% benefit from currency exchange rates in 2024, indicating that while all units experienced positive currency effects, the magnitude differed\u2014likely reflecting varied international market participation or operational hedging approaches.",

      "answer": "The discrepancy in Core Sales Growth figures\u2014showing a 2.0% decline on page 42 versus a 3.0% increase on page 43 for the 2024 vs. 2023 period\u2014can be attributed to differences in how the metric is calculated and presented in various sections of the 10-K. According to page 40, Core Sales Growth is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures to reflect underlying business trends. However, the variation between the two reported figures suggests that different adjustments or segment-specific applications of the metric may be used depending on the context. For instance, the 3.0% growth figure on page 43 may reflect a version of Core Sales Growth that is adjusted for specific business units or operational performance, while the 2.0% decline on page 42 could incorporate additional factors or a broader exclusion set. This illustrates the importance of understanding the specific definitions and exclusions applied in each context, as non-GAAP metrics like Core Sales Growth can vary meaningfully across disclosures, even within the same reporting period.",

Management believ es that reporting this non-GAAP financial measure prov ides useful information to inv estors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher's business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher's rev enue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher's peers. Management also uses this non-GAAP financial measure to measure the Company's operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company's executiv e short-term cash incentiv e program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and div estiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and div estitures can v ary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productiv ity improvements generally refer to improv ed cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a giv en period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a giv en period.\n\n## Sales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\n\n",

The Diagnostics segment experienced a sharper 490 basis point decline due to a 2024 trade name impairment (-305 basis points), dilutive effect of acquisitions (-245 basis points), and lower core sales (-25 basis points), partially offset by acquisition-related fair value adjustments (+100 basis points).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') is designed to prov ide material information relev ant to an assessment of Danaher's financial condition and results of operations, including an ev aluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&amp;A is designed to focus specifically on material ev ents and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicativ e of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that hav e had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management's assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company's MD&amp;A is div ided into fiv e sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Results of Operations\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources\n- Critical Accounting Estimates\n- New Accounting Standards\n\nThis discussion and analysis should be read together with Danaher's audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 included in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2022 is included in Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be referred to for information regarding that period.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nRefer to 'Item 1. Business-General' for a discussion of Danaher's strategic objectiv es and methodologies for deliv ering long-term shareholder v alue. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2024, approximately 58% of Danaher's sales were deriv ed from customers outside the United States. As a div ersified, global business, Danaher's operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic, political and geopolitical factors. Danaher's geographic and industry div ersity, as well as the range of its products and serv ices, help mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country, other than the United States, on its consolidated operating results. The Company's indiv idual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relativ e performance and the outlook for the future.\n\nAs a result of the Company's geographic and industry div ersity, the Company faces a v ariety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological dev elopment (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectiv ity and digitization) in most of the Company's served markets, the expansion and ev olution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company's competitors and regulatory changes. The Company operates in a highly competitiv e business env ironment in most markets, and the Company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and higher-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate inv estments and strategic partnerships, dev elop innov ativ e and differentiated new products and serv ices with higher gross profit margins, expand and improv e the effectiv eness of the Company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improv e operating efficiency and quality, and effectiv ely address the demands of an increasingly regulated global env ironment. The Company is making significant inv estments, organically and through acquisitions and inv estments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its serv ed markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and dev elopment and customerfacing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsiv e to the Company's customers throughout the world and improv e the efficiency of the Company's operations.\n\n## Business Performance\n\nConsolidated rev enues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were flat and core sales decreased 1.5% as compared to 2023. Acquisitions contributed 2.0% to sales in 2024 compared to 2023, and were largely offset by core rev enue declines led by the Biotechnology segment, and to a lesser extent the Life Sciences segment, partially offset by higher core sales in the Diagnostics segment. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 0.5% in 2024 compared to 2023. For the definition of 'core sales' refer to '-Results of Operations' below.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nGeographically, the Company's sales in dev eloped markets in 2024 increased 2% compared to 2023 driv en primarily by increased sales in North America. For the same period, core sales in dev eloped markets were essentially flat, primarily due to increased core sales in North America offset by decreased core sales in Western Europe. Increased demand in the Diagnostics segment, offset by decreased demand in the Biotechnology and Life Sciences segments, contributed to the year-ov er-year flat core sales growth in dev eloped markets. For the same period, sales in high-growth markets decreased year-ov er-year by 4% and core sales in high-growth markets decreased at a mid-single digit rate, due primarily to low double-digit core rev enue declines in China. The decline in core sales in high-growth markets was primarily driv en by lower demand across all segments, due to weakness in capital spending and generally lower underlying activ ity lev els. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company's total sales in 2024.\n\nThe Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, compared to approximately $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $3.9 billion or $5.29 per diluted common share compared to approximately $4.7 billion or $6.38 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2023. 2024 intangible asset impairments and increased operating expenses, net of increased other income, drov e the year-ov er-year decline in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations. In addition to the abov e factors, net earnings from discontinued operations for 2024 compared with 2023 contributed to the lower net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2024. Refer to '-Results of Operations' for further discussion of the year-ov er-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In response to current economic conditions, the Company expects to rev iew and adjust its cost structure. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company commenced an initiativ e to identify productiv ity improv ement and cost sav ings opportunities that we anticipate would generate annual pre-tax sav ings of at least $150 million. The Company expects these opportunities to be broadbased, including opportunities within China and the Diagnostics segment.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2024, the Company acquired 3 businesses for total consideration of $558 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences segment. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of $305 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company's acquisitions.\n\n## Veralto Corporation Separation\n\nOn September 30, 2023 (the 'Distribution Date'), the Company completed the separation (the 'Separation') of its former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation ('Veralto'), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for ev ery three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would hav e been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would hav e receiv ed fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the Separation as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core rev enues or sales/rev enues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP') but excluding:\n\n- sales from acquired businesses (as defined below); and\n- the impact of currency translation.\n\nReferences to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniv ersary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to div ested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of rev enue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- the period-to-period change in rev enue (as defined abov e); and\n- the period-to-period change in rev enue (as defined abov e) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.",

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal revenues increased 6% to $28.8 billion in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV , Oncology and Liver Disease, partially offset by lower sales of Veklury.\n\nNet income attributable to G ilead was $480 million and diluted earnings per share attributable to G ilead was $0.38 in 2024, compared to net income attributable to Gilead of $5.7 billion and $4.50 diluted earnings per share attributable to G ilead in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to:\n\n- A pre-tax IPR&amp;D partial impairment charge of $4.2 billion related to Trodelvy IPR&amp;D assets; and\n- Higher acquired IPR&amp;D expenses, primarily $3.8 billion related to the acquisition of CymaBay; partially offset by\n- Higher product sales; and\n- Lower income tax expense.\n\nPlease refer to 'Results of Operations' below for further information on 2024 results.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs we look to 2025, we expect to see continued increases in demand for our products overall, bolstered by the growth of our HIV  business. We look forward to the regulatory decisions for twice-yearly lenacapavir for HIV  prevention in the U.S. under priority review as well as in the EU where we submitted a marketing authorization application in early 2025. We anticipate that strong, demand-led volume growth in 2025 will be offset by: (i) the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to increase our payment obligations under the redesigned Medicare Part D discount program; (ii) an expected decrease in our Veklury product sales reflecting lower rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations; and (iii) the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening against major foreign currencies.\n\nOur R&amp;D portfolio includes over 100 pre-clinical and clinical-stage programs across our core therapeutic areas. We plan to continue investing in our business and R&amp;D pipeline both internally and externally through partnerships and select business development transactions. For example, we entered into an agreement with LEO Pharma A/S in early 2025 to develop and commercialize their pre-clinical oral signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 programs for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases. In addition, as part of our overall investment approach to fund the advancement of our pipeline and commercialization of our products, we will continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management.\n\nOur ability to deliver on our strategy and 2025 objectives is subject to a number of uncertainties. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch  and  development  expenses  are  recorded  when  incurred  and  consist  primarily  of  personnel  costs  including  salaries,  benefits  and  stock-based compensation expense, infrastructure, materials and supplies and other support costs, research and clinical studies performed by contract research organizations ('CROs') and our collaboration partners and other outside services. From time to time, we enter into development and collaboration agreements in which we share expenses with a collaboration partner. We record payments received from our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of Research and development expenses.\n\nClinical study costs are a significant component of Research and development expenses. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual services completed by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Payments we make for research and development ('R&amp;D') services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets within Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses  are  recorded  when  incurred  and  reflect  costs  of  ex ternally-developed  in-process  research  and development ('IPR&amp;D') projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront and pre-commercialization milestone payments related to various collaborations and the costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are recorded when incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, and selling, marketing and advertising expenses, as well as other general and administrative costs related to finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities.\n\nAdvertising expenses within Selling, general and administrative expenses, including promotional expenses, are recorded when incurred and were $869 million, $826 million and $778 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe provide stock-based compensation in the form of various types of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance share units ('PSUs')  and  stock  options,  and  through  our  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  and  the  International  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (together,  as  amended,  the 'ESPP'). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date, or the first date of the ESPP purchase period, and recognized  over  the  requisite  service  periods  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  using  the  straight-line  ex pense  attribution  approach,  reduced  for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. The requisite service period could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible or if an employee terminates due to death or disability.\n\nThe estimated fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. For PSUs, depending on the terms of the award, estimated fair value is based on either the Monte Carlo valuation methodology or the closing stock price on the grant date. For stock option and ESPP awards, estimated fair value is based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Estimated inputs to that model include (i) expected volatility, based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock price along with implied volatility for traded options on our common stock, (ii) expected term in years, based on the weighted-average period awards are expected to remain outstanding using historical cancellation and exercise data, contractual terms and vesting terms of the award, (iii) risk-free interest  rate,  based  on  observed  interest  rates  appropriate  for  the  term  of  the  stock-based  awards,  and  (iv)  ex pected  dividend  yield,  based  on  our  history  and expectation of dividend payments.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive shares of our common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and equivalents are determined under the treasury stock method.",

      "question": "How does Gilead's classification and valuation of Prepaid and Other Current Assets differ across its Consolidated Balance Sheets, fair value disclosures, and derivative instruments presentation, particularly when comparing the $3,052 million listed in total current assets, the $1,577 million categorized under fair value measurements, and the $6 million included in derivative assets?",
      "answer": "Gilead's classification and valuation of Prepaid and Other Current Assets differ significantly across the three perspectives. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets (page_54), Prepaid and Other Current Assets are reported at $3,052 million as part of total current assets, representing a broad operational view of short-term assets. However, in the fair value disclosures (page_70), only $1,577 million of these assets are included under equity securities measured at fair value, suggesting a narrower subset that is actively marked to market. Meanwhile, in the derivative instruments presentation (page_71), just $6 million of Prepaid and Other Current Assets are shown as part of foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges, highlighting a specific exposure to currency risk within the derivative framework. These differences indicate that the asset is categorized differently depending on the financial context\u2014whether as a general current asset, a fair value instrument, or a derivative hedge\u2014reflecting varying levels of specificity and valuation methodology.",

      "answer": "Gilead's $479 million restructuring charge in 2023, tied to changes in manufacturing strategy, directly influenced product gross margin improvements in 2024 by reducing legacy infrastructure costs. This strategic cost-cutting aligns with how Gilead manages R&D expenses, which include significant personnel costs (salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation). These personnel costs are a core component of R&D spending and are dynamically prioritized based on scientific data, regulatory probability, and resource availability. The $50 million impairment of the bulevirtide IPR&D asset in 2023 further reflects this resource reallocation process\u2014when assumptions around regulatory approval timing change, Gilead adjusts its investment, potentially impacting personnel decisions in related R&D programs. Together, these elements illustrate a coordinated approach to cost containment and strategic refocusing across both operational and R&D functions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch  and  development  expenses  are  recorded  when  incurred  and  consist  primarily  of  personnel  costs  including  salaries,  benefits  and  stock-based compensation expense, infrastructure, materials and supplies and other support costs, research and clinical studies performed by contract research organizations ('CROs') and our collaboration partners and other outside services. From time to time, we enter into development and collaboration agreements in which we share expenses with a collaboration partner. We record payments received from our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of Research and development expenses.\n\nClinical study costs are a significant component of Research and development expenses. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual services completed by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Payments we make for research and development ('R&amp;D') services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets within Prepaid and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses  are  recorded  when  incurred  and  reflect  costs  of  ex ternally-developed  in-process  research  and development ('IPR&amp;D') projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront and pre-commercialization milestone payments related to various collaborations and the costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are recorded when incurred and consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, and selling, marketing and advertising expenses, as well as other general and administrative costs related to finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities.\n\nAdvertising expenses within Selling, general and administrative expenses, including promotional expenses, are recorded when incurred and were $869 million, $826 million and $778 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe provide stock-based compensation in the form of various types of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance share units ('PSUs')  and  stock  options,  and  through  our  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  and  the  International  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (together,  as  amended,  the 'ESPP'). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date, or the first date of the ESPP purchase period, and recognized  over  the  requisite  service  periods  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  using  the  straight-line  ex pense  attribution  approach,  reduced  for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. The requisite service period could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible or if an employee terminates due to death or disability.\n\nThe estimated fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. For PSUs, depending on the terms of the award, estimated fair value is based on either the Monte Carlo valuation methodology or the closing stock price on the grant date. For stock option and ESPP awards, estimated fair value is based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Estimated inputs to that model include (i) expected volatility, based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock price along with implied volatility for traded options on our common stock, (ii) expected term in years, based on the weighted-average period awards are expected to remain outstanding using historical cancellation and exercise data, contractual terms and vesting terms of the award, (iii) risk-free interest  rate,  based  on  observed  interest  rates  appropriate  for  the  term  of  the  stock-based  awards,  and  (iv)  ex pected  dividend  yield,  based  on  our  history  and expectation of dividend payments.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to G ilead is calculated based on Net income attributable to G ilead on our Consolidated Statements of Operations divided by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potentially dilutive shares of our common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and equivalents are determined under the treasury stock method.",

We regularly review our R&amp;D activities based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&amp;D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business. We do not track total R&amp;D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase.\n\nThe following table provides a breakout of expenses by major cost type:\n\n",

      "question": "How do payer-driven access restrictions, volume growth trends, and inventory dynamics collectively shape the trajectory of Repatha sales performance in 2023?",
      "answer": "Repatha sales in 2023 were shaped by a complex interplay of payer-driven access restrictions, volume growth, and inventory dynamics. On one hand, payer actions\u2014such as co-pay accumulator programs, prior authorization requirements, and formulary exclusions\u2014negatively impacted patient access and affordability, prompting Amgen to reduce both net and list prices, including introducing new National Drug Codes for lower-cost availability. Despite these efforts, payer-imposed limitations continued to constrain sales growth. On the other hand, global Repatha sales still increased in 2023 due to volume growth, although this was partially offset by lower net selling prices. This volume growth was supported by improved access under Medicare Part D and commercial plans, as well as inclusion on China\u2019s National Reimbursement Drug List. Meanwhile, inventory dynamics\u2014referring to changes in stock held by wholesalers and end users\u2014were part of the broader sales performance context, though specific inventory impacts for Repatha were not quantified. Together, these three dimensions\u2014payer restrictions, volume gains, and inventory shifts\u2014paint a nuanced picture of Repatha\u2019s 2023 sales trajectory.",

      "answer": "Amgen reported licensing rights as a finite-lived intangible asset with a net value of $600 million in 2023 (down from $741 million in 2022) due to amortization of $3,265 million against a gross carrying amount of $3,865 million. In acquisition accounting, licensing rights were assigned a value of $41 million as part of total consideration of $1,292 million for an acquisition. Additionally, Amgen's contingent consideration obligations, which are tied to product candidates and licensing rights, are modeled using unobservable inputs including probabilities of achieving milestones and sales forecasts, and are reviewed quarterly by R&D and commercial teams. This shows a consistent focus on licensing rights across asset valuation, acquisition allocation, and forward-looking contingent liability modeling.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis of a 1% estimation error in medical costs payable align with the actuarial methods used to estimate those liabilities and the actual year-over-year changes in medical costs payable balances?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis indicates that a 1% estimation error in medical costs payable as of December 31, 2021, would have impacted 2021 net earnings by approximately $184 million. This sensitivity reflects the significance of accurate estimation in the context of the company's actuarial methods, which include applying completion factors and medical cost trend factors to estimate incurred but not reported claims. These estimation techniques, particularly the use of PMPM trend factors and completion factors, directly influence the medical costs payable balance. The year-over-year change in medical costs payable from $21.87 billion at the end of 2020 to $24.48 billion at the end of 2021 shows a $2.61 billion increase, which underscores the dynamic nature of these liabilities and the importance of precise estimation methods in managing financial exposure.",

Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's overall operating earnings performance in 2021 reflect the contributions and trends of its individual business segments, particularly in light of the varying growth and margin dynamics across the enterprise?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's consolidated earnings from operations in 2021 were $23,970 million, representing a 7% increase from 2020. This growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the Optum segment, which contributed $11,995 million in operating earnings, a 19% increase from 2020. Within Optum, Optum Health saw a significant 30% increase in earnings ($4,462 million in 2021), and Optum Insight also showed robust growth of 25% ($3,398 million). However, UnitedHealthcare's operating earnings declined slightly to $11,975 million from $12,359 million in 2020, a 3% drop, despite a 11% increase in revenues. This decline in earnings was reflected in its operating margin, which fell from 6.2% in 2020 to 5.4% in 2021. The consolidated operating margin for the company also decreased slightly from 8.7% to 8.3%, indicating that while Optum's high-margin businesses contributed significantly to earnings growth, UnitedHealthcare's margin contraction placed downward pressure on overall profitability. This interplay between segment performance and margin trends highlights the dual nature of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s earnings drivers.",

      "question": "What is the financial impact of Medicaid cost pressures and elevated utilization trends in the Health Care Benefits segment on CVS's restructuring plans and its intersegment revenue reporting framework?",
      "answer": "The Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures driven by higher-than-expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations, which has placed strain on the Health Care Benefits segment. These pressures, combined with elevated utilization trends persisting through Q4 2024, are expected to impact both the Health Care Benefits and Health Services segments into 2025. In response, CVS initiated an enterprise-wide restructuring plan finalized in Q3 2024, aimed at streamlining operations and generating over $500 million in cost savings for 2025, including the closure of 271 retail stores and impairment charges tied to this effort. These restructuring actions are reflected in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other segments, with workforce optimization and asset impairment charges recorded. Meanwhile, intersegment revenue eliminations\u2014arising from transactions between the Health Care Benefits, Health Services, and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments\u2014must be carefully managed to ensure accurate financial reporting and transparency into the underlying performance of each business unit. Thus, the Medicaid cost pressures and utilization trends are driving both cost-cutting initiatives and complex intersegment financial dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

Other segment items excludes the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance.\n\n(4) The Company's acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting w hich consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider netw orks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment w hen events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in operating expenses w ithin each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underw riting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company's acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded w ithin the Company's G AAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\n(5) The Company's net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities.

Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of the $491 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in 2024 impact CVS\u2019s operating performance and cash flow position, considering the specific debt repayment activity and its reflection in the cash flow statement?",
      "answer": "The $491 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in 2024, resulting from the repayment of $2.6 billion in senior notes, is a non-operational financial item that positively affects net income but is subtracted in the cash flow statement to reconcile net income to operating cash flow. This gain reflects the favorable market conditions that allowed CVS to retire debt at a discount, improving its balance sheet efficiency. However, the cash outflow of $2.0 billion for the debt repayment is reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement, indicating a significant use of liquidity to reduce long-term liabilities. This strategic move aligns with CVS\u2019s broader financial discipline and restructuring efforts, including store closures and asset impairments, as disclosed in the Corporate/Other segment.",

      "answer": "The office real estate optimization charges declined from $117 million in 2022 to $30 million in 2024, reflecting a reduced need for corporate office space due to flexible work arrangements (page_154). This trend aligns with the broader restructuring efforts in 2024, which included $1,179 million in charges, among which store impairment charges were linked to the planned closure of 271 retail stores as part of a strategic review to streamline operations (page_80). The $30 million in 2024 office real estate charges were distributed across segments, with $19 million in Health Care Benefits, $4 million in Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness, and $7 million in Corporate/Other (page_79), indicating that the optimization of real estate was a company-wide initiative, not limited to retail stores but also affecting corporate infrastructure.",

In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company also conducted a review  of its various strategic assets and determined that it w ould discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, at w hich time impairment losses w ere recorded to w rite dow n the carrying value of these assets to the Company's best estimate of their fair value.

      "question": "How did the recurring increases in Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses in 2020 and 2021, including the $2.1 billion IPR&D charge from the Trillium acquisition in Q4 2021, impact Pfizer's operating income growth despite revenue gains?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's operating income growth in 2021 was influenced by a mix of revenue gains and rising expenses, particularly Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses. While the company experienced higher revenues and other favorable factors, increases in expenses, including Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses across both years, partially offset these gains. Specifically, in Q4 2021, a $2.1 billion IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of Trillium significantly contributed to the cost burden, highlighting how such strategic business development activities directly impacted the financial performance. Despite the recurring quarterly cost pattern observed in both 2020 and 2021, the overall increase in operating income indicates that revenue growth and other mitigating factors outweighed these rising expenses to some extent.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income\n\nThe increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $17.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to: (i) higher revenues, (ii) net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020, (iii) lower asset impairment charges, and (iv) higher net gains on equity securities, partially offset by (v) increases in: Cost of sales, Research and development expenses and Selling, informational and administrative expenses.\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&amp;A and Note 4 for additional information.\n\nFor information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&amp;A and Note 5 .\n\n## Our Operating Environment\n\nWe, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Regulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity\n\nOur product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&amp;D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a product's overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product's labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.\n\n## Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\n\nThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\n\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.\n\n## Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures\n\nThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, 'international reference pricing' (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities if they go into effect. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and -Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.\n\n## Product Supply\n\nWe periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions or shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent Chantix recall. For information on our recent Chantix recall and risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Global Economic Environment\n\nIn addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions including inflation, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n28",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n\n## G. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss) . The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net . For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net , and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\n\n## H. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\n\nRevenue Recognition --We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.\n\nOur Sales Contracts --Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.\n\nDeductions from Revenues --Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\n\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns-Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\n\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\n\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\n\n- Customers --Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and nongovernment institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- In the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective period's sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare 'coverage gap,' also known as the 'doughnut hole,' based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.\n- Outside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the government's total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\n- Provisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\n\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven products in 2020 and for each of six products in 2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of our revenues in 2019. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n60",

      "question": "How does Pfizer's strategic transformation involving the Consumer Healthcare JV, as reflected in its segment reorganization and equity investment, reconcile with its broader financial structure and resource allocation decisions?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's strategic transformation culminated in a reorganization that led to the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of its Upjohn Business in late 2020, shifting the company to focus on science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. Beginning in 2020, Pfizer operated as a single operating segment, Biopharma, and later restructured into two segments: Biopharma and PC1. The Consumer Healthcare JV was funded in part by a $15.711 billion equity-method investment from Pfizer in 2019, reflecting a major financial commitment to this strategic shift. This investment is also excluded from the operating segment results, as the JV's earnings are included under 'Corporate and Other Unallocated' costs, indicating that the JV's financial performance does not directly influence the evaluation of segment-level performance by the chief operating decision maker. This strategic and financial separation highlights Pfizer's intent to focus on its core biopharmaceutical business while maintaining a significant, though operationally distinct, stake in consumer healthcare.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\n\n## Note 17 . Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\n\n## A. Segment Information\n\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\n\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&amp;D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&amp;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\n\n## Other Costs and Business Activities\n\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\n\n- WRDM--the R&amp;D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&amp;D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&amp;D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer's medicines.\n- GPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&amp;D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\n- Corporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n- Certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&amp;E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\n\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\n\n## Segment Assets\n\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n101",

      "question": "How does the growth trajectory of Abbott's Rapid Diagnostics business in 2021, as reflected in both its total sales and geographic distribution, reconcile with the impact of its COVID-19 testing-related sales and the recovery of routine diagnostic testing?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Abbott's Rapid Diagnostics business reported total sales of $8.553 billion, with $5.034 billion in U.S. sales and $3.519 billion internationally. This reflects a 93.3% increase from 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, driven primarily by strong demand for Abbott's point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform, BinaxNOW Ag Card test in the U.S., and Panbio platform internationally. Notably, $6.6 billion of Rapid Diagnostics sales in 2021 were attributed to COVID-19 testing-related activities, indicating that growth was heavily influenced by pandemic-related demand. Excluding these sales, Rapid Diagnostics still grew by 10.4%, which the company attributed to the recovery of routine diagnostic testing. This aligns with the broader context that the increase in 2021 was not solely pandemic-driven but also included a rebound from the prior year's disruption, where routine testing was negatively impacted by the early stages of the pandemic.",

          "chunk_text": "In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 12.4 percent in 2021 and decreased 2.8 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In 2021, growth was driven by increased volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower sales of Abbott's laboratorybased tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. In 2020, the decrease was due to the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other  laboratories  due  to  COVID-19,  partially  offset  by  sales  of Abbott's  COVID-19  laboratory-based  tests  for  the detection  of  the  IgG  and  IgM  antibodies.  Core  Laboratory  Diagnostics  COVID-19  testing-related  sales  on Abbott's ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $204 million and $262 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, Core Laboratory  Diagnostics  sales  increased  16.9  percent,  excluding  COVID-19  testing-related  sales,  and  increased  14.4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales.\n\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, sales decreased 2.9 percent and increased 225.7 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In 2021, the decrease was due to lower demand for Abbott's laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 platform, partially offset by growth in the base business from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform. In 2020, the increase reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott's laboratorybased molecular tests for COVID-19. Abbott received U.S. FDA approval in March 2020 for its Alinity m molecular diagnostics system. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $891 million and $1.0 billion in 2021 and  2020,  respectively.  In  2021,  Molecular  Diagnostics  sales  increased  29.2  percent,  excluding  COVID-19  testingrelated sales, and increased 27.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales.\n\nIn Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 93.3 percent and 112.3 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect  of  foreign  exchange,  due  to  strong  demand  for  Abbott's  point-of-care  COVID-19  molecular  test  on  its  ID NOW platform and its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test in the U.S. as well as international demand for COVID-19 rapid tests on its Panbio platform.  The sales increase for 2021 also included the recovery of routine diagnostic testing. The sales increase for 2020 also included increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S., partially offset by the  unfavorable  impact  of  COVID-19  on  routine  diagnostic  testing  in  2020.    Rapid  Diagnostics  COVID-19  testingrelated  sales  were  $6.6  billion  and  $2.6  billion  in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.    In  2021,  Rapid  Diagnostics  sales increased 10.4 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 9.2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales.\n\nIn  Medical  Devices,  sales  increased  19.4  percent  and  decreased  3.8  percent  in  2021  and  2020,  respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange.  In 2021, the increase was driven by double-digit growth across all divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology.  In 2020, double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was more than offset by decreases in Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower vascular sales in China in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program.\n\nThe 2021 and 2020 growth in Diabetes Care revenue was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's continuous  glucose  monitoring  system,  internationally  and  in  the  U.S.  In  2021,  FreeStyle  Libre  sales  totaled  $3.7 billion, which reflected a 36.8 percent increase over 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. FreeStyle Libre sales in 2020 were $2.6 billion, which reflected a 42.6 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2019 when sales totaled $1.8 billion.\n\nWhile  procedure  volumes  across  Abbott's  cardiovascular  and  neuromodulation  businesses  were  negatively impacted  early  in  2021  by  elevated  COVID-19  case  rates  in  certain  countries,  including  the  U.S.,  overall  volumes improved over the course of 2021 across various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In January 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for MitraClip \u00ae , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. The growth in Structural Heart during 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip  and TriClip \u00ae ,  the  world's  first  minimally  invasive,  clip-based  device  for  repair  of  a  leaky  tricuspid  heart valve which was launched in Europe in May 2020.\n\nAbbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in  accordance  with  Abbott's  revenue  recognition  policies  as  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There  are  no  significant  patent  or  license  expirations  in  the  next  three  years  that  are  expected  to  materially  affect Abbott.",

      "answer": "The Diagnostic Products segment is Abbott's largest by revenue, generating $15.6 billion in net sales in 2021, significantly outpacing other segments like Medical Devices and Nutritional Products. It also maintains a substantial operational footprint with 24 manufacturing sites, placing it second only to Medical Devices in terms of physical infrastructure. However, despite its financial and operational prominence, the narrative description in the business overview emphasizes Established Pharmaceutical Products in terms of therapeutic diversity and market engagement, with no comparable depth of detail for Diagnostic Products, suggesting a potential misalignment between financial weight and strategic narrative emphasis.",

      "question": "How does Abbott's Nutritional Products segment compare to other segments in terms of revenue contribution relative to its operational scale and strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Nutritional Products segment generated $8,294 million in net sales in 2021, making it the second-largest segment by revenue, behind only Medical Devices ($14,367 million) and ahead of Established Pharmaceutical Products ($4,718 million) and Diagnostic Products ($15,644 million) \u2014 though the latter had significantly higher operating earnings ($6,256 million vs. $1,763 million for Nutritional Products). Despite its strong revenue position, Nutritional Products operates from only 14 manufacturing sites \u2014 fewer than Medical Devices (27), Diagnostic Products (24), and Established Pharmaceutical Products (25) \u2014 suggesting a more capital-efficient footprint. Strategically, while Nutritional Products is one of the four reportable segments and a core part of Abbott's diversified health care business, the narrative description in the business overview emphasizes other segments more explicitly, particularly Established Pharmaceutical Products, which details a wide range of therapeutic areas and marketing strategies, indicating potentially different levels of strategic emphasis across segments.",

These  products  are  generally  sold  directly  to  wholesalers, distributors,  government  agencies,  health  care  facilities,  pharmacies,  and  independent  retailers  from  Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or copromoted with, or licensed from, other companies.\n\nThe principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:\n\n- gastroenterology products, including Creon\u2122,  for  the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal\u2122 and Dicetel\u2122, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral\u2122, Transmetil\u2122, and Samyr\u2122, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac\u2122, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;\n- women's health products, including Duphaston\u2122, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston\u2122, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women;\n- cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl\u2122 and TriCor\u2122, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten\u2122 and Teveten\u2122 Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens\u2122, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid\u2122, for the treatment of hypothyroidism;\n- pain  and  central  nervous  system  products,  including  Serc\u2122,  for  the  treatment  of  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's  disease  and vestibular  vertigo;  Brufen\u2122,  for  the  treatment  of  pain,  fever,  and  inflammation;  and  Sevedol\u2122,  for  the treatment of severe migraines; and\n- respiratory  drugs  and  vaccines,  including  the  anti-infective  clarithromycin  (sold  under  the  trademarks Biaxin\u2122, Klacid\u2122, and Klaricid\u2122); and Influvac\u2122, an influenza vaccine.\n\nThe  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment  directs  its  primary  marketing  efforts  toward  building  strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers.\n\nCompetition  in  the  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment  is  generally  from  other  health  care  and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures.\n\n*          As  used  throughout  the  text  of  this  report  on  Form  10-K,  the  term  'Abbott'  refers  to Abbott  Laboratories,  an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "Abbott's Established Pharmaceutical Products segment reported operating earnings of $889 million on $4,718 million in net sales in 2021, yielding a margin of approximately 18.8%. This margin performance is supported by a substantial global manufacturing footprint of 25 sites, which likely enables cost efficiencies and localized production in key emerging markets. Strategically, the segment focuses on branded generics across therapeutic areas like gastroenterology, women's health, and cardiovascular disease, targeting markets where brand recognition and partnerships can sustain margins despite generic competition.

Abbott's* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products.\n\n## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nAbbott  has  four  reportable  segments:  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products,  Diagnostic  Products,  Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\n\n## Established Pharmaceutical Products\n\nThese products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and  sold  outside  the  United  States  in  emerging  markets.  These  products  are  generally  sold  directly  to  wholesalers, distributors,  government  agencies,  health  care  facilities,  pharmacies,  and  independent  retailers  from  Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or copromoted with, or licensed from, other companies.\n\nThe principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:\n\n- gastroenterology products, including Creon\u2122,  for  the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal\u2122 and Dicetel\u2122, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral\u2122, Transmetil\u2122, and Samyr\u2122, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac\u2122, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;\n- women's health products, including Duphaston\u2122, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston\u2122, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women;\n- cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl\u2122 and TriCor\u2122, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten\u2122 and Teveten\u2122 Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens\u2122, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid\u2122, for the treatment of hypothyroidism;\n- pain  and  central  nervous  system  products,  including  Serc\u2122,  for  the  treatment  of  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's  disease  and vestibular  vertigo;  Brufen\u2122,  for  the  treatment  of  pain,  fever,  and  inflammation;  and  Sevedol\u2122,  for  the treatment of severe migraines; and\n- respiratory  drugs  and  vaccines,  including  the  anti-infective  clarithromycin  (sold  under  the  trademarks Biaxin\u2122, Klacid\u2122, and Klaricid\u2122); and Influvac\u2122, an influenza vaccine.\n\nThe  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment  directs  its  primary  marketing  efforts  toward  building  strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers.\n\nCompetition  in  the  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment  is  generally  from  other  health  care  and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures.\n\n*          As  used  throughout  the  text  of  this  report  on  Form  10-K,  the  term  'Abbott'  refers  to Abbott  Laboratories,  an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How did Paxlovid's 2024 revenue performance reflect both the prior-year $3.5 billion revenue reversal and the transition from government to traditional commercial market sales, particularly in light of its 57% operational decline in international markets?",
      "answer": "Paxlovid's 2024 revenue performance was significantly shaped by two key factors: the prior-year $3.5 billion revenue reversal and the transition from government to traditional commercial market sales. In 2024, the favorable final adjustment of $771 million to the $3.5 billion reversal, along with a one-time contractual delivery of $442 million to the U.S. SNS, contributed positively to U.S. revenue. However, international markets saw a 57% operational decline, driven by the transition to out-of-pocket sales in China and reduced contractual deliveries elsewhere. Additionally, the U.S. government\u2019s share of Pfizer\u2019s total revenues decreased due to the broader shift of Paxlovid (and Comirnaty) from government procurement to commercial market sales, as noted in the accounts receivable disclosures. This illustrates how Paxlovid's revenue was both boosted by prior-year adjustments and constrained by structural market transitions.",

Biopharm a was the only reportable segm ent. See Note 17A and the Item 1. Business--Commercial Operations section. At the beginning of 2025, we m ade the following changes within our Biopharm a reportable segm ent that went into effect on January 1, 2025 to support our continued focus on com m ercial execution and to further strengthen P fizer's capabilities and leadership in discovering and developing breakthrough m edicines and vaccines:\n\n- transitioned the P fizer U .S. O ncology com m ercial organization and the global O ncology m arketing organization, which were part of the form er P fizer O ncology D ivision, into the Pfizer U .S. C om m ercial D ivision, which now focuses on the com m ercialization of P fizer's entire product portfolio in the U .S. and is led by the C hief U .S. C om m ercial O fficer, Executive Vice P resident; and\n- combined our global OR D  and P R D  organizations to form  a single P fizer R &amp;D  organization that is responsible for all R &amp;D  activities across all therapeutic areas.\n\nI n the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a m ulti-year, enterprise-wide cost realignm ent program  (R ealigning O ur C ost Base P rogram ) that aim s to realign our costs with our longer-term  revenue expectations. In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a m ulti-year, m ulti-phased program  to reduce our costs of goods sold (M anufacturing O ptim ization P rogram ), which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancem ents. See Note 3 . F or a description of anticipated savings related to these program s, see the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated w ith Acquisitions and CostReduction/Productivity Initiatives section within M D &amp;A .\n\nR&amp;D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R &amp;D  is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the m edicines and vaccines that m ay be the m ost im pactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and developm ent are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R &amp;D  efforts seek to add value to our existing products by im proving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section for our R &amp;D  priorities and strategy.\n\nWe seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term  growth opportunities, including:\n\n- an aging global population that is generating increased dem and for innovative m edicines and vaccines that address patients' unm et needs; and\n- advances in both biological science and platform  technologies that are enhancing the delivery of potential breakthrough new m edicines and vaccines.\n\nOur Business Development Initiatives --We are com m itted to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, prim arily by advancing our own product pipeline and m axim izing the value of our existing products, but also through various business developm ent activities. W e view our business developm ent activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. W e assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business developm ent activities that will help advance our business strategy. See Note 2 for significant recent activities.\n\n## Our 2024 Performance\n\nTotal Revenues--Total revenues increased $4.1 billion, or 7%, to $63.6 billion in 2024 from  $59.6 billion in 2023, reflecting an operational increase of $4.4 billion, or 7%, partially offset by an unfavorable im pact of foreign exchange of $349 m illion, or approxim ately 1%. T he operational increase was prim arily driven by P axlovid, the addition of legacy Seagen revenues in full-year 2024 following the acquisition in D ecem ber 2023, and growth from  the Vyndaqel fam ily and E liquis, partially offset by declines in C om irnaty. T he operational increase for P axlovid was prim arily due to: (i) a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the expected return of an estim ated 6.5 million treatm ent courses of E U A labeled U .S. governm ent inventory and (ii) revenue in 2024 of $1.2 billion from  two one-tim e item s: a $771 m illion favorable final adjustm ent recorded in the first quarter of 2024 to the aforem entioned $3.5 billion revenue reversal; and $442 m illion from  the one-tim e contractual delivery of treatm ent courses to the U .S. SN S. See Note 17C. Excluding contributions from  C om irnaty and P axlovid, Total revenues increased 12% operationally.\n\nThe following chart outlines the com ponents of the net change in Total revenues :\n\nSee the Total Revenues by Geography and Total Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within M D &amp;A for m ore inform ation, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue perform ance. C ertain of our vaccines, including C om irnaty, are subject to seasonality of dem and, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, and P axlovid revenues trend with infection rates.

      "answer": "In 2024, Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses decreased by $41 million, primarily due to a $790 million reduction in promotional and marketing spend for products like Comirnaty and Paxlovid, but this was partially offset by $630 million in higher compensation-related expenses and a $140 million increase for corporate enabling functions tied to the acquisition of Seagen. This aligns with the broader expense trends in 2023, where increases in this category were noted as a factor in the decline in domestic income compared to 2022. The 2024 reduction reflects both the impact of cost realignment efforts and strategic investments in talent and corporate infrastructure, suggesting a shift in focus toward internal capabilities and integration of acquisitions rather than external promotion.",

      "question": "How does Pfizer's reorganization of its commercial segments in 2024, the contingent liabilities associated with its acquisitions, and the operational role of PC1 as a contract development and manufacturing organization collectively impact the company's strategic alignment and financial risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's 2024 reorganization of its commercial segments, which included the integration of Seagen and the restructuring of its oncology, U.S., and international divisions, created a more focused and streamlined commercial framework aimed at enhancing execution speed and market responsiveness. This reorganization directly affects how internal demand for manufacturing and development services is routed through PC1, which serves as Pfizer's contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. The operational role of PC1 becomes more critical under this new structure, as it supports the Biopharma segment\u2019s expanded product portfolio and increased R&D activity post-Seagen acquisition. Concurrently, Pfizer reported $517 million in contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2024, primarily tied to prior acquisitions, including the Seagen deal. These contingent liabilities, which include potential future milestone payments, introduce financial risk exposure that could impact cash flows if certain sales or development thresholds are met. Thus, the reorganization, combined with acquisition-related obligations, increases PC1\u2019s strategic importance in fulfilling internal manufacturing needs while also heightening the financial stakes tied to successful integration and performance of acquired assets.",

Attorney's O ffice for the W estern D istrict of Virginia, in coordination with the D epartm ent of Justice's C om m ercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and inform ation related to program s P fizer sponsored in retail pharm acies relating to Xeljanz. W e have produced records pursuant to this request.\n\n## B. Guarantees and Indemnifications\n\nI n the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indem nify our counterparties against certain liabilities that m ay arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indem nified party were to m ake a successful claim pursuant to the term s of the indem nification, we m ay be required to reim burse the loss. T hese indem nifications are generally subject to various restrictions and lim itations. H istorically, we have not paid significant am ounts under these provisions and, as of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the estim ated fair value of these indem nification obligations is not m aterial to P fizer.\n\nI n addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreem ents and other transactions, our counterparties m ay be obligated to indem nify us. F or exam ple, our global agreem ent with BioNTech to co-develop a m R N A-based coronavirus vaccine program  aim ed at preventing C O VID -19 infection includes certain indem nity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and P fizer has agreed to indem nify the other for certain liabilities that m ay arise in connection with certain third-party claim s relating to C om irnaty.\n\nSee Note 7D for inform ation on P fizer I nc.'s guarantee of the debt issued by P I E  in M ay 2023. W e have also guaranteed the long-term  debt of certain subsidiaries of P fizer and certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of P fizer. See Note 7D .\n\n## C. Certain Commitments\n\nAs of D ecem ber 31, 2024, we had com m itm ents totaling $4.1 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. T hese com m itm ents include purchase obligations for goods and services and paym ents relating to potential m ilestone paym ents deem ed reasonably likely to occur.\n\nSee Note 5A for inform ation on the T C JA repatriation tax liability.\n\n## D. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions\n\nWe may be required to m ake paym ents to sellers for certain prior business com binations that are contingent upon future events or outcom es. See Note 1D . T he estim ated fair value of contingent consideration as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 is $517 m illion, of which $39 m illion is recorded in Other current liabilities and $477 m illion in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of Decem ber 31, 2023 was $692 m illion, of which $179 m illion was recorded in Other current liabilities and $512 m illion in Other noncurrent liabilities . T he decrease in the contingent consideration balance from  D ecem ber 31, 2023 is prim arily due to paym ents m ade upon the achievem ent of certain sales-based m ilestones.\n\n## E. Insurance\n\nOur insurance coverage reflects m arket conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the tim e it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies accordingly. D epending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the am ount of self-insurance m ay be significant. T he cost and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance coverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a m aterial adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\n\n## Note 17. Segment, G eographic and Other Revenue Information\n\n## A. Segment Information\n\nWe manage our com m ercial operations through three operating segm ents, each led by a single m anager: Biopharm a, P C 1 and P fizer Ignite. Biopharm a is engaged in the discovery, developm ent, m anufacture, m arketing, sale and distribution of biopharm aceutical products worldwide. P C 1 is our contract developm ent and m anufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharm aceutical ingredients. P fizer Ignite is an offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R &amp;D  services to select innovative biotech companies that align with P fizer's R &amp;D  focus areas. P rior to June 2024, P C 1 and P fizer Ignite were m anaged together by a single m anager as part of the form er Business Innovation operating segm ent. Biopharm a is the only reportable segm ent. P fizer's C O D M  is the C hairm an and C hief E xecutive O fficer. O ur C O D M  uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segm ents, am ong other factors, for perform ance evaluation and resource allocation. T he C O D M  uses segm ent revenues and earnings in the annual budgeting process when setting strategic goals for the com pany and considers periodic budget-to-actual variances in segm ent revenues and earnings when assessing perform ance of the segm ents and m aking decisions about allocating resources to the operating segm ents. By analyzing segm ent financial results, the C O D M  can discern trends, which can inform  decisions that align with the company's goals and objectives, and help ensure risks are m anaged appropriately. W e regularly review our operating segm ents and the approach used by m anagem ent to evaluate perform ance and allocate resources.\n\nOur com m ercial divisions m arket, sell and distribute our products, and global operating functions are responsible for the research, developm ent, m anufacturing and supply of our products. E ach operating segm ent is supported by our global corporate enabling functions. At the beginning of 2024, we m ade changes in our com m ercial organization to incorporate Seagen and im prove focus, speed and execution. The com m ercial structure within our Biopharm a reportable segm ent in 2024 was com prised of the P fizer O ncology D ivision, the Pfizer U .S. C om m ercial D ivision, and the P fizer I nternational C om m ercial D ivision:\n\n- Pfizer Oncology D ivision com bined the U .S. O ncology com m ercial organizations, global O ncology m arketing organizations and global and U .S. O ncology m edical affairs from  both Pfizer and Seagen.\n- Pfizer U .S.

Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statem ents include the accounts of our parent com pany and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U .S. G AAP . T he decision of whether or not to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of m ajority voting interests, as well as effective econom ic or other control over the entity. T ypically, we do not seek control by m eans other than voting interests. F or subsidiaries operating outside the U .S., the financial inform ation is included as of and for the year ended N ovem ber 30 for each year presented. P fizer's fiscal year-end for U .S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended D ecem ber 31 for each year presented. All significant transactions am ong our subsidiaries have been elim inated.\n\nWe manage our com m ercial operations through three operating segm ents, each led by a single m anager: Biopharm a, P C 1 and P fizer Ignite. Biopharm a is the only reportable segm ent. See Note 17A .\n\nOn Decem ber 14, 2023, we com pleted the acquisition of Seagen. In addition, other acquisitions and business developm ent activities com pleted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 im pacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2.\n\nWe have m ade certain reclassification adjustm ents to conform  prior-period am ounts to the current presentation for:\n\n- in the first quarter of 2024, we reclassified royalty incom e (substantially all of which is related to Biopharm a) from Other (income)/deductions--net and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item  within Total revenues in our consolidated statem ents of operations, and reclassified the associated royalty receivables from Other current assets to Trade accounts receivable, less allow ance for doubtful accounts in our consolidated balance sheet; and\n- segm ent reporting and geographic inform ation in connection with the com m ercial reorganization that went into effect on January 1, 2024 (see Notes 9 and 17 ).\n\nCertain am ounts in the consolidated financial statem ents and associated notes m ay not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded am ounts.\n\n## B. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2024\n\nOn January 1, 2024, we adopted a new accounting standard which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in m easuring equity securities at fair value. T he new guidance is consistent with our existing policy; therefore, it had no im pact on our consolidated financial statem ents.\n\nI n the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted a new accounting standard which requires the disclosure of significant segm ent expenses that are regularly provided to the C O D M  and included within each reported m easure of segm ent profit or loss, other segm ent item s by reportable segm ent and a description of its com position. See Note 17A .\n\n## C. Estimates and Assumptions\n\nI n preparing these financial statem ents, we use certain estim ates and assum ptions that affect reported am ounts and disclosures. T hese estim ates and assum ptions can im pact all elem ents of our financial statem ents. F or exam ple, in the consolidated statem ents of operations, estim ates are used when accounting for deductions from  revenues, determ ining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form  of depreciation and am ortization, and estim ating restructuring charges and the im pact of contingencies, as well as determ ining provisions for taxes on incom e. O n the consolidated balance sheets, estim ates are used in determ ining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determ ining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which also im pact the consolidated statem ents of operations. C ertain estim ates of fair value and am ounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, im pairm ent reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investm ents and financial instrum ents, valuation allowances, pension and postretirem ent benefit plans, contingencies, share-based com pensation, and other calculations can result from  a com plex series of judgm ents about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estim ates and assum ptions.\n\nOur estim ates are often based on com plex judgm ents and assum ptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estim ates and assum ptions are not representative of actual outcom es, our results could be m aterially im pacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determ ined with precision, our estim ates and assum ptions m ay prove to be incom plete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circum stances m ay occur that m ight cause us to change those estim ates and assum ptions. W e are subject to risks and uncertainties that m ay cause actual results to differ from  estim ated am ounts, such as changes in the healthcare environm ent, com petition, litigation, legislation, developm ent of com peting assets by us or others, regulatory actions, or product recalls or withdrawals. W e regularly evaluate our estim ates and assum ptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. W e adjust our estim ates and assum ptions when facts and circum stances indicate the need for change.\n\n## D. Acquisitions\n\nOur consolidated financial statem ents include the operations of acquired businesses after the com pletion of the acquisitions. W e account for acquired businesses using the acquisition m ethod of accounting, which requires, am ong other things, that m ost assets acquired and liabilities assum ed be recognized at their estim ated fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IP R &amp;D  be recorded on the balance sheet. T ransaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. W hen we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U .S. G AAP , no goodwill is recognized and acquired IP R &amp;D  is expensed in Acquired in-process research and development expenses .\n\nContingent consideration in a business com bination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. F air value is generally estim ated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D . Any liability\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n57",

The governance section confirms that the company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact to date but reiterates the potential for such incidents to result in financial costs and regulatory action, referencing the risk factors section.

      "answer": "JNJ's acquisition of Shockwave Medical for $335.00 per share is directly aligned with a strategic pivot in its MedTech segment, where internal R&D spending dropped from $319 million in 2023 to $167 million in 2024. Despite this decline in R&D, the segment saw a significant increase in identifiable assets, rising from $74,710 million in 2023 to $84,322 million in 2024. This suggests that rather than investing organically through internal R&D, JNJ is prioritizing external growth through acquisitions to expand its MedTech portfolio and asset base.

Acquisitions and divestitures\n\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $132.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion. The Company expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject to applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stockholders and other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative M edicine segment beginning on the acquisition date.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nAcquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Company's financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $15.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal year 2024 acquisitions primarily included; A mbrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave M edical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The remaining acquisitions were not material.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $0.8 billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results of operations are included in the Innovative M edicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $1.2 billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&amp;D, for $0.9 billion, goodwill for $0.3 billion, and $0.3 billion of liabilities assumed which included $0.1 billion related to a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. A cquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal 2024 were not material.\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave M edical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a leading, first-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IV L) technology for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D) in an all-cash merger transaction. The Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Shockwave's common stock for $335.00 per share through a merger of Shockwave with a subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations were included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\n90",

This reduction in internal R&D investment coincides with a robust external acquisition strategy, including the purchase of Ambrx Biopharma for $1.8 billion net of cash acquired, which brought in a proprietary synthetic biology platform for next-generation antibody drug conjugates. The valuation methodology for these acquisitions incorporated probability-adjusted success factors (ranging from 40% to 50%) and discount rates (9.0%\u201316%), reflecting the inherent regulatory and commercial risks of early-stage drug development.

Acquisitions and divestitures\n\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $132.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion. The Company expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject to applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stockholders and other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative M edicine segment beginning on the acquisition date.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nAcquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Company's financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $15.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal year 2024 acquisitions primarily included; A mbrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave M edical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The remaining acquisitions were not material.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $0.8 billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results of operations are included in the Innovative M edicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $1.2 billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&amp;D, for $0.9 billion, goodwill for $0.3 billion, and $0.3 billion of liabilities assumed which included $0.1 billion related to a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. A cquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal 2024 were not material.\n\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave M edical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a leading, first-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IV L) technology for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CA D) and peripheral artery disease (PA D) in an all-cash merger transaction. The Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Shockwave's common stock for $335.00 per share through a merger of Shockwave with a subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations were included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\n90",

Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal 2024 were $0.9 billion of which $0.4 billion was related to the fair value of the inventory step-up and was recorded in Cost of products sold and $0.5 billion primarily related to equity awards and was recorded in Other (income) expense. The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CA D and PA D IV L products with the average weighted lives of 14 years. The IPR&amp;D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&amp;D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk inherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The discount rate applied was 9.0%.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (A mbrx), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (A DCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of approximately $2.0 billion, or $1.8 billion net of cash acquired. The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of A mbrx's common stock for $28.00 per share through a merger of A mbrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The results of operations were included in the Innovative M edicine segment as of the acquisition date.

This enhances transparency into the MedTech segment's operating performance and cost structure (page_88).
