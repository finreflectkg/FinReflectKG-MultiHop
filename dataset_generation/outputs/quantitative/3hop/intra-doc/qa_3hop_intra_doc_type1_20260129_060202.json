      "answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment reported 6% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange. This aligns with P&G's broader strategic focus on organic growth, as emphasized in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), where organic sales growth is defined as net sales growth excluding these same external factors. The MD&A further underscores the importance of organic growth as a key indicator of the company's underlying business performance and sustainability, suggesting that the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment's growth is a meaningful contributor to this strategic objective.",

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported that the Beauty segment experienced a low single-digit increase in net sales in 2024, contributing to the company's overall 2% growth in net sales. However, the detailed breakdown reveals that this growth was driven by a 4% increase in pricing, which was partially offset by a 1% decline in product mix. This indicates that while pricing strategy positively impacted the segment's performance, challenges in product mix\u2014potentially due to shifting consumer preferences or competitive pressures\u2014tempered overall growth. The combination of these factors explains how the segment achieved only modest net sales growth despite strong pricing power.",

      "answer": "Costco's Other International Segment negatively impacted gross margin by increasing 2% rewards, contributing to the 65 basis point decrease in total gross margin percentage in 2022. Despite this, the international segment is characterized by a higher rate of square footage growth compared to domestic markets, as noted in the operating model section. While square footage expansion in foreign markets supports net sales growth, the initial operating profitability of new warehouses is lower, suggesting a trade-off between near-term margin pressure and long-term revenue scaling. This implies that Costco's international expansion is strategically prioritizing growth through real estate investment, even at the cost of short-term margin compression.",

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basispoint  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  driven  by  decreases  in  fresh  foods  and  foods  and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted  by  one  basis  point  due  to  increased  2%  rewards.  Warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the  negative  impact  of  a  one-time  charge  related  to  granting  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off. Changes in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  gross  margin  by  approximately  $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO  charge.  Our  Other  International  segment  was  negatively  impacted  by  increased  2%  rewards.  All  segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.",

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.

Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report).

The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omnichannel initiatives.

This discrepancy arises because the organic growth metric adjusts for foreign exchange headwinds of 2% (page_32), which are not reflected in the reported net sales. Therefore, while the segment appears stagnant in reported terms, its underlying business performance is slightly positive when adjusted for FX volatility.",

      "question": "How does PEP's depreciation and amortization expense in the PBNA segment compare with its acquisition-related spending in the same segment, and what might this indicate about the segment's investment strategy over recent years?",
      "answer": "PEP reported depreciation and amortization expenses for the PBNA segment at $926 million in 2021, $899 million in 2020, and $857 million in 2019, indicating consistent capital investment and asset utilization. On the other hand, acquisition-related spending in the PBNA segment totaled $11 million in 2021 and $66 million in 2020, primarily linked to the Juice Transaction and Rockstar acquisition. The relatively modest acquisition spending compared to the high depreciation and amortization suggests that PEP's PBNA segment has been more focused on optimizing existing assets rather than pursuing aggressive new acquisitions in recent years.",

      "answer": "The Smokeable products segment had $2,963 million in Other Intangible Assets, net in 2023, indicating a significant valuation of its intangible properties such as brand strength and customer relationships. However, the segment reported a $29 million loss in the same year, suggesting operational challenges or declining profitability. This contrast implies that while the segment retains substantial intangible value, its current financial performance introduces risk to the long-term recoverability and justification of these asset valuations. Analysts would need to assess whether the segment\u2019s losses could trigger future impairment charges against the intangible assets.",

Meanwhile, the segment's net sales growth was 14.0% with a negligible foreign exchange impact of -0.5%, resulting in an organic sales growth of 14.5%. This FX-adjusted organic growth is significantly higher than the Total Company\u2019s organic sales growth of 7.0%. The high organic growth relative to its depreciation suggests that Pet Nutrition is utilizing its assets more effectively than the company average, potentially signaling stronger operational efficiency or market demand dynamics within this segment.",

      "answer": "CL reported a 6% increase in operating profit in Asia Pacific, with gross profit margin expansion of 210 bps attributed to cost savings (280 bps) and higher pricing, despite a 110 bps drag from higher raw and packaging material costs. This aligns with the global gross profit margin analysis, which noted a 230 bps negative impact from material costs, and the Hill's Pet Nutrition segment, where material costs reduced gross profit margin by 170 bps. The consistent mention of material costs as a headwind across all segments suggests that while cost savings and pricing have helped mitigate these pressures, they have not fully offset the rising input costs across the business.",

      "answer": "The decline in PBNA's restructuring charges from $51 million in 2022 to $16 million in 2023 suggests reduced investment in restructuring activities. However, PBNA's depreciation and other amortization expenses remained high at $1,003 million in 2023, indicating that the segment continues to bear significant fixed asset and intangible asset costs. This implies that while PBNA may be reducing short-term restructuring costs, it is still managing a large base of long-term assets, which could affect future profitability and cash flow dynamics.",

      "answer": "The consolidated operating results show that net revenues increased by 10.7%, with a significant portion of this growth attributed to favorable pricing variance driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing. However, at the segment level, operating income decreased by 10.5%, partly due to higher marketing, administration, and manufacturing costs, including a $24 million charge related to the Swedish Match AB offer. This contrasts with the pricing benefits seen in the consolidated results, indicating that while pricing strategies boosted top-line growth, increased operational costs and charges negatively impacted bottom-line performance. The $204 million South Korea indirect tax charge and $27 million charge from the termination of a pledge agreement further pressured profitability despite the favorable pricing dynamics.",

In the segment reporting, Sam's Club U.S. is positioned as a distinct reportable segment focused on warehouse membership clubs and digital commerce, contrasting with Walmart U.S.'s broad mass merchandising approach and Walmart International's global retail operations.

The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.

      "question": "How does MDLZ's strategic emphasis on segment operating income as a performance metric relate to the quantified impact of net pricing on adjusted operating income growth, given that net pricing negatively impacted segment operating income in 2020 but contributed positively in 2021?",
      "answer": "MDLZ emphasizes segment operating income as a key performance metric (page_134), which excludes certain corporate-level items to provide transparency into operational performance. In 2020, net pricing had a negative impact on segment operating income, contributing to a 0.3 pp drag on net revenues (page_61). However, in 2021, net pricing contributed favorably at 1.4 pp to net revenue growth and was a key driver of the $317 million (17.9%) increase in segment operating income. This contrasts with the adjusted operating income analysis (page_54), where higher net pricing added $495 million to adjusted operating income in 2019. The divergence in net pricing's impact across time and metrics suggests that while pricing strategy had a measurable effect on profitability, its influence was modulated by other factors such as input costs, volume/mix, and currency. This dynamic relationship underscores the importance of viewing pricing strategy through both segment performance and consolidated adjusted income lenses.",

Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net.

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

      "answer": "MDLZ reports that 'Higher Net Pricing' contributed $678 million to Adjusted Operating Income (page 49), indicating pricing power as a major lever for operating income growth. This pricing impact is confirmed in the segment operating performance analysis (page 60), where higher net pricing is cited as a cross-category driver of segment operating income growth, alongside volume/mix and cost productivity. However, the segment operating income disclosure (page 134) emphasizes geographic volume/mix dynamics\u2014particularly across Latin America, AMEA, Europe, and North America\u2014as central to how management evaluates and allocates resources across business units. This suggests that while pricing contributes significantly to headline operating income, underlying segment performance and strategic resource allocation are more heavily influenced by regional volume trends and product mix, reflecting a nuanced view of profitability drivers at both the consolidated and business-unit levels.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented.

Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.\n\nOur segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were:\n\n",

      "question": "Given PBNA's negative $11 million total contribution in 2021, how significant were employee protection costs as a proportion of PBNA's overall 2021 expenses, and what might this indicate about the segment's cost structure during that period?",
      "answer": "PBNA reported a negative total contribution of $11 million in 2021, indicating an operating loss. Within this, employee protection costs amounted to $14 million, which exceeds the segment's overall net loss. This suggests that employee protection costs were a major contributor to PBNA's negative performance, potentially signaling that external pressures, such as pandemic-related safety measures, imposed a substantial fixed cost burden on the segment during 2021. This interpretation is supported by the context that these costs were disclosed alongside other discretionary or event-driven expenses, indicating a strained cost structure under challenging operating conditions.",

This represents a decrease in capital spending compared to $1,723 million in 2023, while depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively stable at $1,003 million.

      "answer": "FLNA's inventory write-downs dropped significantly from $8 million in 2020 to nearly zero in 2021, indicating improved inventory management or reduced product obsolescence. This reduction coincided with FLNA's minimal acquisition-related spending of only $2 million in 2021, compared to $29 million in 2020. The alignment suggests that FLNA may have shifted focus from external growth through acquisitions to optimizing internal operations, such as inventory efficiency, during this period.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's North America segment, as part of its finished product operations, generates higher net operating revenues but operates with lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate operations. This structural dynamic, combined with rising input costs for raw materials like HFCS and orange juice concentrate due to supply chain disruptions and climate-related risks, places significant pressure on the company's ability to maintain profitability. Since finished product operations have less margin flexibility, inflationary cost increases in this segment are harder to absorb or offset through pricing strategies, increasing the risk of margin compression and negatively impacting overall financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The citrus industry is impacted by the variability of weather conditions and by greening disease, which affect the supply and quality of orange juice and orange juice concentrate, which are important raw materials for our business. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.\n\nAn increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials, aluminum cans and other containers that may be caused by changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; supplier quality and reliability issues; trade disruptions; changes in supply chain; and increases in tariffs; or events such as natural disasters, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like could negatively impact our net operating revenues and profits.\n\n## We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on various costs, such as our costs for materials and labor, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we are dependent upon, among other things, raw materials, packaging materials, plant labor and transportation providers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, geopolitical developments, demand for raw materials, weather, growing and harvesting conditions, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. We expect the inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2022.\n\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company's operating and internal control structures, including extending our Company's internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved with overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of key portions of our operations.

      "answer": "The LatAm segment had capital spending of $837 million in 2024, contributing $394 million to the total depreciation and other amortization expenses of $3,086 million. This indicates that LatAm's capital spending is significantly tied to long-term asset depreciation, with a notable proportion of its investment flowing into amortizable assets. Compared to other segments, LatAm ranks fourth in capital spending but third in depreciation contribution, suggesting a relatively high depreciation rate compared to its peers like Europe ($568 million capital spending leading to $377 million depreciation) and APAC ($294 million capital spending leading to $116 million depreciation).

      "question": "How does the unfavorable volume/mix impact on net revenues reported in the operating results section reconcile with the favorable volume/mix contribution to net revenues mentioned in the consolidated operating results, and what does this reveal about PMI's regional performance dynamics?",
      "answer": "In the operating results (page 61), PMI reports that unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette volume and unfavorable cigarette mix, partially offset favorable pricing, contributing to a 3.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions. In contrast, the consolidated operating results (page 30) indicate that favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, contributed to a 7.6% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions. This apparent contradiction is explained by regional differences: while Europe experienced a decline in cigarette volume and a shift in mix, HTU growth in other markets offset these effects. The variance table (page 65) confirms that volume/mix positively impacted net revenues by $42 million. This synthesis reveals that PMI's volume/mix performance is regionally divergent, with HTU growth compensating for combustible tobacco declines, highlighting a strategic shift toward next-generation products.",

      "question": "How does PEP's capital spending allocation for FLNA in 2024 compare with its pension and retiree benefit obligations for the same segment, and what might this suggest about its financial prioritization?",
      "answer": "In 2024, PEP allocated $1,182 million in capital spending to FLNA, which represents a decrease compared to $1,341 million in 2023 and $1,464 million in 2022. Meanwhile, FLNA's pension and retiree medical benefits expense for 2024 was $150 million, significantly lower than the cumulative capital expenditures for the same period. This suggests that PEP is prioritizing long-term infrastructure and operational investments over immediate pension liabilities within the FLNA segment. However, the segment still carries a substantial portion of the company\u2019s overall pension obligations, as evidenced by the $402 million plan-to-date funding through 2024. This contrast indicates a strategic balance between sustaining capital investment and managing legacy benefit liabilities.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(page_76) \u2192 Capital Spending: PEP reports $1,182 million in capital spending for FLNA in 2024, showing a declining trend from prior years.",
        "Hop 2: Capital Spending \u2192 FLNA: Capital spending is directly attributed to FLNA, indicating strategic investment in this business segment.",
        "Hop 3: FLNA \u2190 PEP(page_82): FLNA is also associated with $150 million in pension and retiree medical benefits expense in 2024, with a cumulative obligation of $402 million."

      "answer": "FLNA reported $806 million in depreciation and other amortization expenses in 2024, compared to $150 million in pension and retiree medical benefits expenses for the same period. This indicates that the segment's capital-intensive operations, as reflected in its depreciation burden, represent a significantly larger financial commitment than its personnel-related liabilities. This suggests that FLNA's financial profile is more heavily shaped by asset utilization and capital investment than by long-term employee benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "PBNA's $1,003 million depreciation and amortization expense in 2023 significantly outweighs its $16 million acquisition/divestiture charges, suggesting that PepsiCo is prioritizing the maintenance and utilization of existing assets over major structural changes or expansion through acquisitions in North America. The relatively low restructuring charges compared to ongoing asset costs indicate a strategic focus on optimizing current operations rather than pursuing aggressive transformation in the region.",

      "answer": "PBNA's capital spending in 2024 was $1,541 million, which is the second-highest among all segments after FLNA's $1,182 million. Correspondingly, PBNA's depreciation and other amortization expense for 2024 was $1,047 million, the highest among all segments. This indicates that PBNA is one of the most asset-intensive segments, as it requires significant capital investment which in turn leads to higher depreciation expenses. This aligns with the expectation that higher capital spending typically correlates with higher depreciation costs, reflecting the segment's reliance on physical assets for its operations.",

      "answer": "PM reported a 2.5% increase in total cigarette and HTU shipment volume globally (excluding China and the U.S.), with the International Duty Free segment contributing significantly through a 14.5% shipment growth. This outperformance relative to the broader market, which only grew by 1.5%, suggests that PM gained share or benefited from specific dynamics in the Duty Free channel. The International Duty Free market itself grew by 34.4%, far exceeding the overall regional average, indicating strong demand in this channel. This growth directly supported PM\u2019s operating income, which increased by 21.0% (excluding currency and acquisitions), driven by favorable volume/mix, including higher HTU volume. Thus, the International Duty Free segment was a key driver of PM\u2019s overall shipment and profitability performance despite modest global market growth.",

Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.\n\nFrom time to time, PMI's shipment volumes and IMS are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements (or wholesaler inventory movements in certain markets where PMI does not sell to distributors), and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of  PMI's competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences  that  may  affect  the  timing  of  sales  to  customers.

      "answer": "The Oral tobacco products segment's goodwill remained unchanged at $5,078 million from 2022 to 2023, indicating no new acquisitions or impairments. However, its Other Intangible Assets, net decreased slightly from $9,097 million in 2022 to $9,065 million in 2023. This reduction aligns with MO's overall trend, where total Other Intangible Assets, net increased from $12,384 million to $13,686 million, primarily due to acquisitions. This suggests that while the Oral tobacco segment saw a minor decline in intangible assets, the company offset this by acquiring new intangible assets in other areas.

      "answer": "QFNA's upfront payments to customers remained at $0 in both 2020 and 2021, as shown in the respective data tables for those years. Additionally, QFNA's proportion of total expenses was consistently 1% in both 2020 and 2021, indicating no change in its relative contribution to overall expenses during this period. The absence of upfront payments aligns with QFNA's minimal expense allocation, suggesting limited direct financial engagement with customer incentives compared to other segments.",

      "answer": "Colgate invested $332 million in capital expenditures for the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in 2021 (page 117), yet the segment reported only a 3% net sales increase for the same year (page 48). This relatively modest growth in sales, especially when compared to the significant capital outlay, suggests that the returns on investment may not have been immediately reflected in top-line performance. The discrepancy could indicate long-term strategic investments in infrastructure, innovation, or market expansion that may yield returns in future periods rather than immediately. Alternatively, it could point to inefficiencies or challenges in translating capital spending into current-period sales growth within this segment.",

This suggests that QFNA operates with a lower labor-related risk exposure compared to other business segments, potentially indicating a less labor-intensive operational model or more stable workforce conditions.

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported that the Fabric & Home Care segment contributed to a mid-single-digit increase in organic sales on page 20, aligning with the 5% organic sales growth specifically noted for that segment in the detailed reconciliation table on page 32. The company emphasizes organic sales growth on page 32 as a key non-GAAP metric for assessing management performance, particularly because it strips away the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange. This suggests that the company views the Fabric & Home Care segment's organic performance as a core driver of its strategic goals, consistent with its broader narrative of prioritizing sustainable, organic expansion across business units.",

      "answer": "The Beauty segment reported a net sales growth of 2% for the year ended June 30, 2022. This growth was primarily driven by a 3% contribution from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% negative impact from product mix. Volume, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, had no positive or negative impact on growth. This indicates that the segment's net sales growth was entirely attributable to pricing strategies, with mix dynamics acting as a drag on performance.",

      "answer": "The 2021 inventory write-down and product return expense for LatAm was only $1 million, suggesting relatively stable inventory management or low return activity in the region. However, this minimal expense contrasts with the LatAm region's declining revenue contribution, which dropped to 5% in 2021 from 6% in 2020 and 7% in 2019. This indicates that despite a small financial impact from inventory issues, the region experienced a consistent decline in revenue contribution over three years. The combination of low write-downs and shrinking revenue suggests that the decline may not be due to inventory inefficiencies but could reflect broader market or operational challenges in the region.",

      "answer": "In 2020, the AMESA segment reported a significant acquisition-related inflow of $173 million linked to the Pioneer Foods transaction, indicating substantial asset additions. This acquisition likely contributed to the increase in depreciation and other amortization expenses for AMESA, which rose from $116 million in 2019 to $149 million in 2020 and further to $181 million in 2021. The upward trajectory in depreciation and amortization aligns with the capital investment made through the Pioneer Foods acquisition, demonstrating the financial impact of that transaction on the segment\u2019s long-term asset base and associated costs.",

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's relatively low depreciation expense in the Quaker Foods North America segment align with its minimal pandemic-related costs compared to other business units?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) segment reported only $51 million in depreciation and no amortization of intangible assets in 2023, significantly lower than other segments like PBNA ($1,003 million depreciation) and Europe ($347 million). This suggests a less asset-intensive operation. The same segment also recorded just $1 million in pandemic-related costs in 2022, far below the $23 million in PBNA or $21 million in Europe. The alignment indicates that QFNA's operational structure\u2014with fewer capital assets\u2014may have been more resilient or less disrupted during the pandemic, resulting in both lower depreciation and limited pandemic exposure compared to more asset-heavy or geographically vulnerable segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(page_75) \u2192 Depreciation and Other Amortization: PepsiCo discloses depreciation and amortization expenses by segment, showing that QFNA has significantly lower depreciation costs compared to other segments.",
        "Hop 2: Depreciation and Other Amortization \u2192 QFNA: QFNA is one of the segments with the lowest depreciation and no intangible asset amortization, indicating a less capital-intensive business model.",
        "Hop 3: QFNA \u2190 PEP(page_74): QFNA also experienced the lowest pandemic-related costs among all segments in 2022, suggesting a correlation between its asset-light model and lower exposure to pandemic disruptions."

      "answer": "FLNA has reduced its capital spending from $1,464 million in 2022 to $1,182 million in 2024, signaling a potential strategic shift or budget reallocation. At the same time, the segment's pension and retiree medical benefits expense has risen significantly, from $46 million in 2022 to $150 million in 2024. This suggests that a growing portion of FLNA's financial resources is being directed toward addressing long-term employee obligations rather than reinvestment in capital assets. The combination of these two trends may indicate a prioritization of liability management over growth-oriented spending, potentially impacting the segment\u2019s long-term operational capacity or expansion plans.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's Latin America segment reported a slight decrease in operating profit, with specific mention of a net organic volume decline and certain operating cost increases that were only partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. In contrast, the North American businesses (FLNA and PBNA) showed effective net pricing helping to offset volume declines, with FLNA's operating profit decreasing 7% and PBNA experiencing flat net revenue but not specifying profit changes. Despite these regional challenges, the company-wide operating margin improved 0.9 percentage points, primarily driven by effective net pricing and productivity savings across the business, suggesting that stronger pricing power in some markets compensated for volume losses and cost pressures in others.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(page_48) \u2192 Operating Profit: Latin America's operating profit decreased slightly, impacted by operating cost increases, a 10-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an indirect tax reserve, and net organic volume decline, partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings.",
        "Hop 2: Operating Profit \u2192 Effective Net Pricing: Effective net pricing was a consistent factor mentioned across multiple regions as a partial offset to various cost and volume pressures, indicating its importance in maintaining profitability despite challenging market conditions.",
        "Hop 3: Effective Net Pricing \u2190 PEP(page_47): In North America, effective net pricing helped offset volume declines in FLNA (which saw a 7% decrease in operating profit) and supported flat net revenue in PBNA despite volume declines, contributing to the company's overall 8% operating profit growth and 0.9 percentage point margin improvement."

      "answer": "Grooming reported a strong 9% organic sales growth (from hop2_evidence), outpacing all other segments. However, net assets for Grooming declined from $12,703 million in fiscal 2023 to $12,633 million in fiscal 2024 (from hop3_evidence). This decline occurred despite the segment's top-line performance, suggesting potential constraints in reinvestment or capital retention. Unlike other segments such as Beauty and Health Care, which saw increases in net assets, Grooming\u2019s decline may signal tighter capital allocation, higher depreciation, or strategic divestitures within the segment. This divergence raises questions about whether the segment is generating sufficient cash flow to support sustainable growth or if operational pressures are limiting its ability to maintain or grow its asset base.",

      "answer": "The Beauty segment's minimal 1% contribution to net sales growth in 2024, despite a 4% price increase, suggests that volume or mix effects may have offset the positive impact of pricing. This low growth contribution is juxtaposed with the segment's substantial net asset position of $13.723 billion as of June 30, 2024. During the year, the segment experienced a $104 million reduction in net assets due to translation and other adjustments, which indicates foreign exchange or accounting impacts negatively affected the segment's reported asset value. The combination of modest sales growth and asset value decline implies that the Beauty segment's financial performance, while stable in terms of pricing, did not significantly expand in real or currency-adjusted terms during the year.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Health Care segment contributed $7,638 million to the company's net sales in fiscal 2024, representing a slight decrease from the previous year. Despite this, the segment reported a 5% net sales growth, which is higher than the company's overall net sales growth of 2%. This implies that while the segment is growing faster than the company average, its absolute contribution to total net sales declined, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining or expanding its market position within a competitive landscape. This contrast highlights a nuanced performance where relative growth is positive, but absolute sales have contracted.",

      "answer": "Despite QFNA contributing only 1% to PEP's overall segment operating profit consistently from 2019 to 2021, it reported depreciation and amortization expenses of $44 million in 2019, $41 million in 2020, and $46 million in 2021. This level of depreciation is relatively high compared to its negligible operating profit contribution, suggesting that QFNA is a capital-intensive segment or holds significant tangible or intangible assets relative to its revenue generation. In contrast, larger segments like PBNA and FLNA, which contribute significantly more to operating profit, have proportionally lower depreciation and amortization expenses relative to their size, indicating a different asset structure or operational model.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's FLNA segment shows a consistent decline in annual capital spending, dropping from $1,464M in 2022 to $1,182M in 2024 (page 76). However, the Plan to Date through fiscal 2024 reports a cumulative capital expenditure commitment of $402M for FLNA (page 82). This suggests that despite the overall downward trend in annual capital spending, FLNA remains a key area of investment focus within PepsiCo's broader capital allocation strategy. The $402M cumulative figure indicates a strategic commitment to FLNA's infrastructure and capabilities, even as annual capital outlays decrease, potentially reflecting more efficient use of capital or prioritization of high-impact projects.",

      "question": "How does the minimal revenue contribution from the QFNA segment compare with its proportion of depreciation and other amortization expenses, and what does this suggest about the capital intensity of this business unit relative to its size?",
      "answer": "The QFNA segment contributes only 1% of total revenue, as disclosed in the segment revenue breakdown, yet it accounts for a non-trivial portion of the company's depreciation and other amortization expenses, with $46 million in 2021. This suggests that despite its small revenue footprint, QFNA requires a relatively significant level of capital investment compared to its size. This is further emphasized when compared to larger segments like PBNA (19% revenue contribution) which has much higher absolute depreciation expenses, but aligns with the pattern seen in other smaller segments like APAC. The capital intensity of QFNA, therefore, appears disproportionately high relative to its revenue contribution.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(page_72) \u2192 QFNA: QFNA contributes only 1% of total revenue in 2021, indicating it is a small segment by revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2024, QFNA reported capital spending of $124 million and depreciation and other amortization expenses of $46 million. This indicates that the segment is investing more in new capital than it is expensing through depreciation, suggesting a potential growth or modernization phase where new assets are being added at a faster rate than they are being retired or worn down. This aligns with the company's broader capital spending strategy, as seen in other segments, where investment outpaces depreciation, indicating a net increase in asset base.",

      "answer": "The 9% net sales growth in Procter & Gamble's Health Care segment was driven by a combination of 4% volume growth (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), a 3% contribution from pricing, and a 3% contribution from product mix. This indicates that the growth was not solely dependent on acquisition or divestiture activity but was supported by underlying pricing power and product mix improvements. In contrast, the volume growth contribution of 4% suggests that organic demand played a significant role in the segment's performance, distinguishing it from segments where pricing was the primary driver.",

      "answer": "The Beauty segment's net earnings decreased from $3,210 million in 2021 to $3,160 million in 2022 despite reporting a 2% net sales growth and no acquisition or divestiture impact, suggesting that factors such as increased operating costs, lower gross margins, or higher expenses offset the positive effect of sales growth on profitability. This indicates potential margin pressures within the segment despite stable sales performance.",

        "Hop 1: PG(page_50) \u2192 Net Earnings/(Loss): PG discloses that the Beauty segment's net earnings decreased from $3,210 million in 2021 to $3,160 million in 2022.",

However, PBNA also reported $11 million in acquisition/divestiture-related charges during the same year, indicating that part of the capital allocation was used for transactional activities such as the Juice Transaction and Rockstar. This suggests that PBNA was both a recipient of capital investment and a contributor to restructuring or transaction costs during 2021.",

      "answer": "The $107 million favorable volume/mix contribution to adjusted operating income growth on page 49 was a key driver of the 17.9% segment operating income increase mentioned on page 61. However, as noted on page 134, segment operating income excludes several items including divestitures/acquisition impacts, amortization of intangible assets, and centrally managed benefit plan non-service income. This means the favorable volume/mix impact includes both operational performance and potentially some acquisition/divestiture effects that are later excluded in segment operating income. The reconciliation shows how favorable volume/mix contributes to profitability before these exclusions, highlighting the operational strength in snack demand despite input cost pressures.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net.

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Health Care segment reported a 5% net sales growth, primarily driven by a 4% contribution from pricing and a 2% from mix improvements, as detailed in the sales growth drivers. This aligns with the segment-level performance, where pricing and product mix played a critical role in achieving the overall growth, despite a 1% volume decline. The combination of these factors confirms that the growth was not volume-based but rather driven by pricing strategies and improved product mix.",

      "answer": "In 2024, PEP allocated $837 million in capital spending to LatAm, significantly higher than their 2024 pension and retiree medical benefits expense of $51 million in the same region. This disparity suggests that PEP is prioritizing growth and infrastructure investments over near-term benefit obligations in LatAm, aligning with a long-term strategic focus on market expansion and operational development in the region.",

      "answer": "The depreciation and amortization expenses for the LatAm segment fluctuated between $270 million in 2019, $251 million in 2020, and $283 million in 2021, showing no clear trend. However, during the same period, the percentage contribution of LatAm to total operating profit declined from 7% in 2019 to 6% in 2020 and 5% in 2021. This suggests that despite relatively stable or even increasing capital investment (as indicated by depreciation and amortization), the segment's profitability relative to the company as a whole was declining, indicating potential inefficiencies or external challenges affecting the region's performance.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported that the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment had no net sales growth in fiscal 2024 despite a 3% price increase contribution, indicating that volume declines (-2%) and foreign exchange impacts (-2%) fully offset the positive effect of pricing. This suggests significant volume erosion in this segment, which is contrary to the overall company growth of 2% and highlights potential market share challenges or demand elasticity issues in this category.",

The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "PEP's pension plan asset allocation strategy, which includes equities, high-quality debt securities, and real estate, directly affects the performance of plan assets relative to expectations. On page 96, the company explains that amortization of net (loss) gain reflects the recognition of differences between actual experience and assumptions\u2014such as investment returns\u2014on plan assets and benefit obligations. Page 98 shows that PEP targets a long-term rate of return of 7.5% for U.S. plan assets in 2025, up from 7.4% in 2024, and actively manages the portfolio to meet this objective. If actual returns deviate from these expectations due to allocation decisions or market conditions, it results in gains or losses that are amortized into future income statements. Therefore, strategic shifts in asset mix or underperformance relative to the 7.5% target could increase volatility in amortization charges, directly impacting reported pension costs and earnings.",

      "answer": "The decline in AMESA's acquisition and divestiture-related charges from $10 million in 2021 to $2 million in 2023 aligns with a parallel decrease in the segment's depreciation and other amortization expenses, which fell from $181 million to $167 million over the same period. This suggests a reduction in both restructuring activity and the associated long-term asset write-downs or amortization within the AMESA region. The drop in charges indicates less M&A-related activity, which likely contributed to the lower depreciation burden, reflecting a more stable or consolidated operational footprint in the region.",

      "answer": "The LatAm segment reported charges of $64 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2022, showing a significant decrease. Over the same period, the Depreciation and Other Amortization expenses for LatAm increased from $283 million in 2021 to $306 million in 2022. This indicates that while the segment reduced its short-term charges, it continued to invest in long-term assets, as reflected in the rising depreciation and amortization expenses.",

      "answer": "The mid-single-digit net sales growth for Fabric & Home Care, as reported in the segment performance section, aligns with the overall 2% increase in company net sales to $84.0 billion. However, the total company growth is lower than the segment's growth due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of 2%, which offset some of the pricing-driven gains. While Fabric & Home Care contributed positively with 4% reported growth and 5% organic growth, other segments like Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care had lower or flat growth, limiting the total company growth to 2%. This indicates that while Fabric & Home Care performed consistently, the broader portfolio's performance was mixed, with some segments not contributing significantly to overall sales growth.",

      "answer": "The favorable mix effect of 1% in the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment, driven by volume growth and pricing, contrasts with the unfavorable mix impact in Fabric & Home Care, where premium-priced products with lower gross margins grew disproportionately. This divergence suggests that while some segments benefited from mix improvements, others\u2014like Fabric & Home Care\u2014experienced gross margin pressures due to the shift toward lower-margin premium products. Despite this, total company mix improved by 1%, indicating that gains in Baby, Feminine & Family Care offset some of the pressures in other segments.",

Unfavorable foreign  exchange  decreased  net  sales  by  2%.  Higher  pricing increased  net  sales  by  5%.  Mix  had  a  neutral  impact  to  net sales. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

      "answer": "The negative 5% foreign exchange impact on Oral, Personal and Home Care net sales in 2020, as disclosed on page 48, indicates that currency fluctuations reduced the segment's reported sales growth. Despite this headwind, the segment still achieved 6% organic sales growth. On page 117, the company reported $274 million in capital expenditures for Oral, Personal and Home Care in 2020, suggesting continued investment in the segment's infrastructure and operations. This implies that the company maintained a strategic focus on long-term growth in the segment despite short-term currency challenges.",

      "answer": "QFNA's $46 million depreciation and other amortization expense in 2021 is relatively high compared to its minimal 1% contribution to operating profit, suggesting potential inefficiencies in how the segment utilizes its assets. While depreciation expenses typically reflect ongoing investment in physical assets, the segment's low profitability indicates that these investments are not generating significant returns. This contrast highlights a concern for a segment that is not proportionally contributing to overall profitability despite incurring notable depreciation costs, potentially signaling underperforming assets or operational challenges.",

These losses will be gradually recognized in earnings, creating downward pressure on future net income and potentially impacting key financial metrics such as operating margins and earnings per share.

      "answer": "The impact of foreign exchange on Baby, Feminine & Family Care's net sales growth is quantified as a 1% reduction, as shown in the segment performance table. This aligns with the broader context of unfavorable foreign exchange effects mentioned in the Fabric & Home Care segment, where foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Both segments experienced negative impacts from foreign exchange, but Baby, Feminine & Family Care's reduction was proportionally smaller. This suggests that while foreign exchange pressures were a company-wide challenge, their effect varied across segments, with Baby, Feminine & Family Care being less severely impacted compared to Fabric & Home Care.",

          "chunk_text": "\nFabric &amp; Home Care net sales increased 6% to $27.6 billion in fiscal  2022  on  a  3%  increase  in  unit  volume.  Unfavorable foreign  exchange  decreased  net  sales  by  2%.  Higher  pricing increased  net  sales  by  5%.  Mix  had  a  neutral  impact  to  net sales. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's year-to-date capital spending on QFNA in 2024 was $124 million, as reported on page 76. However, their disclosed full-year plan for QFNA through December 2024 indicates a cumulative planned spending of only $30 million, as shown on page 82. This significant difference suggests that either the company front-loaded its investment strategy for QFNA early in the year or that actual spending has exceeded initial projections. Without explicit commentary on strategic intent, the data alone raises questions about whether this reflects a revised outlook or an unplanned deviation from the original capital allocation plan.",

      "answer": "The unfavorable pricing variance in Indonesia significantly contributed to the 2.3% decrease in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions), primarily due to lower pricing for combustible products. Combustible products, which include cigarettes and other tobacco products, are a major component of PM's operating revenues, as stated on page 97. The pricing pressure in Indonesia, only partially offset by the Philippines, directly weighed on revenue performance for this category, despite favorable mix dynamics in the same region. This shows that despite the strategic importance of combustible products to PM's revenue, pricing pressures in key markets like Indonesia had a measurable negative impact on financial performance.",

Despite the general trend of a stronger U.S. dollar negatively affecting other segments (like Latin America and Asia Pacific), Global Ventures benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar relative to currencies such as the euro and British pound, which had a favorable impact on its financials.

This favorable mix was also noted in page 58, where favorable cigarette mix in regions like the Philippines and Indonesia partially offset lower cigarette volumes.

      "answer": "MDLZ reported that favorable volume/mix contributed 3.6 percentage points to the 9.3% growth in net revenues in 2021, driven by increased demand across most snack categories and recovery in the world travel business. However, the company also disclosed risks on another page indicating that supply chain constraints, particularly in the U.S. and U.K. in the second half of 2021, could limit the ability to grow net revenues. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices and input costs posed a risk to profitability and revenue growth, especially as the company may not always be able to pass these costs on to consumers without affecting demand. Therefore, while favorable volume/mix positively impacted net revenues, the company faced countervailing risks related to supply chain limitations and input cost volatility that could undermine sustained revenue growth despite strong demand.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

      "question": "How does Grooming's contribution to net sales growth in 2024 compare to the overall net sales growth of Procter & Gamble, and what does this suggest about the segment's performance relative to the company's broader business?",
      "answer": "The Grooming segment contributed 4% to Procter & Gamble's net sales growth in 2024, outperforming the company's overall net sales growth of 2%. This indicates that Grooming was a stronger-performing segment compared to the rest of the business. The segment's growth was driven by a 1% volume increase (excluding acquisitions and divestitures) and an 8% price increase, despite a 5% headwind from foreign exchange. This suggests that Grooming was not only resilient in the face of currency pressures but also a key growth engine for P&G during the year.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Grooming segment achieved strong organic sales growth of 9%, yet overall net sales growth was only 2% due to a 5% negative impact from foreign exchange. The Grooming segment had a net sales balance of $12,633 million as of June 30, 2024, and the company noted mid-single digit increases in this segment. While the segment performed well organically, the foreign exchange headwind significantly dampened the reported net sales growth. This contrast highlights how currency fluctuations can mask underlying business performance, particularly for global segments like Grooming with significant international exposure.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ reconcile the risk of input cost volatility and supply constraints limiting net revenue growth with the $678 million operating income benefit attributed to higher net pricing in its adjusted operating income?",
      "answer": "MDLZ acknowledges in its risk factors that input cost volatility and supply constraints could limit net revenue growth by forcing price increases that reduce consumer demand or by constraining production capacity. However, the company also implemented a strategic pricing approach that contributed $678 million to adjusted operating income. This was achieved through favorable net pricing across all categories except cheese & grocery, as noted in the year-over-year revenue analysis, which offset some of the adverse effects from input cost increases. The financial reporting on page 49 confirms that despite the risks outlined, the company successfully passed through some of these increased costs to consumers, demonstrating a deliberate pricing strategy to maintain profitability even in the face of supply chain pressures.",

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "answer": "The $76 million negative impact from Post-Employment Benefits listed under 'Other Income/Expense' on page 124 reflects a current-year expense related to post-employment obligations. This contrasts with the $21 million Prior Service Cost debit noted in the amortization table on page 123, which indicates a reduction in benefits or an adjustment to prior service obligations. The connection suggests that while the company is recognizing a significant expense in the current year related to post-employment benefits, it is also adjusting its prior service cost assumptions downward, potentially signaling a revision in long-term obligations or benefit structures. This dual movement highlights a complex dynamic in how the company is managing its post-employment liabilities\u2014recording current costs while revising past assumptions in a way that affects overall liability estimates.",

However, this growth was overshadowed in financial terms by an 11% unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact on consolidated operating income. While the U.S. dollar's strength against currencies like the Argentine peso and Mexican peso hurt performance in Latin America and other regions, the Global Ventures segment saw a favorable impact from a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound. Despite the positive volume growth, the overall operating income declined by 12% due to compounding pressures from higher commodity costs, SG&A expenses, and refranchising impacts, which were only partially offset by the pricing initiatives and the FX gains in certain markets.",

This contrast reveals that while Walmart is investing in digital capabilities across both segments, the U.S. focus is on enhancing customer experience and driving same-store growth through digital fulfillment, whereas international eCommerce expansion is occurring at a much larger scale and growing rapidly in absolute dollar terms.

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.3% and 1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.\n\n## Margin\n\nOur objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") ex penses. Additionally, we focus on our mix  of businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.\n\n",

      "answer": "The Fabric & Home Care segment experienced a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on its $27.6 billion in net sales, which still allowed for 6% reported sales growth and 8% organic sales growth. Meanwhile, the Health Care segment saw a 1% foreign exchange headwind, but this only modestly affected its strong performance, as organic sales growth reached 10%. This suggests that while foreign exchange negatively impacted both segments, the Health Care segment's underlying organic momentum was robust enough to overcome currency pressures more effectively than Fabric & Home Care.",

Unfavorable foreign  exchange  decreased  net  sales  by  2%.  Higher  pricing increased  net  sales  by  5%.  Mix  had  a  neutral  impact  to  net sales. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

      "answer": "The $2 million indirect tax impact, disclosed on page 130, is a cost that partially offsets the $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense resulting from the Swiss tax reform. This leads to a net benefit of $767 million, as disclosed on page 40. The reform's broader implications include a shift in MDLZ's tax strategy, particularly with the acquisition of Chipita in 2022, which may lead to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets tied to the step-up in intangible assets. This suggests that while the indirect tax cost is relatively minor, the overall tax reform has a significant positive impact on earnings and provides future tax flexibility.",

Income Taxes\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures ), we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in 2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.\n\nEarnings/(losses) from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of:\n\n",

See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

          "chunk_text": "internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

Additionally, the segment realized 3% growth from pricing and 3% from mix effects, contributing to a total of 10% organic sales growth.

      "answer": "The $246 million pre-tax charge related to Saudi Arabia customs assessments in 2021, which was recorded as a reduction in net revenues for the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment, directly impacted the base year comparison for PMI's consolidated net revenues. This reduction in 2021 revenues influenced the year-over-year growth calculation, meaning that the $3.4 billion increase in net revenues reported for 2023 must be viewed in the context of prior-year charges that lowered the comparative base. While the 2023 results show strong growth (10.7%), the prior-year customs charge contributed to a lower starting point, thereby amplifying the apparent growth in 2023. This chain of impact illustrates how discrete regulatory and customs events in specific markets can shape multi-year financial performance trends.",

      "answer": "The $1,232 million in losses to be amortized for pension plans on page 123 indicates the accumulated losses that will be recognized over time, while the $85 million amortization of net losses recognized in earnings for post-employment benefits on page 124 reflects the current year\u2019s portion of those amortized losses being transferred to earnings. This implies that while the pension plan has a significant amount of deferred losses, only a portion is being systematically recognized in earnings each year, which affects the company\u2019s short-term financial performance. The difference highlights the accounting mechanism that spreads long-term pension liabilities across multiple periods, balancing the immediate earnings impact.",

      "answer": "PEP's 2024 LatAm segment expense is $51 million, with 10% of that amount allocated to expected pre-tax charges, equating to $5.1 million. This percentage is lower than the 15% allocated by FLNA, 25% by PBNA, and 25% by Europe, but higher than the 5% by AMESA and 4% by APAC. This indicates that LatAm has a relatively moderate allocation of pre-tax charges compared to other segments, reflecting either a strategic prioritization or lower exposure to chargeable activities in that region.",

      "answer": "PBNA's amortization of intangible assets decreased slightly from $28 million in 2020 to $25 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in the value of acquired intangible assets being expensed annually. However, the segment's depreciation and other amortization expenses increased from $899 million in 2020 to $926 million in 2021, suggesting a growing capital investment in tangible assets such as property, plant, and equipment. This divergence implies that while the segment may have had fewer new intangible asset additions or a revaluation of existing ones, it continued to invest heavily in physical infrastructure, pointing to an increase in capital intensity and potentially expanding operational capacity.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble highlights the Health Care segment as a standout performer with 10% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022, reflecting its strong contribution to the company's overall growth. This aligns with the company's strategic emphasis on organic sales growth, which is defined and disclosed in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) as a core non-GAAP metric used by management to evaluate performance. The MD&A further explains that organic sales growth excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange, making it a clean indicator of underlying business performance. The strong 10% growth in Health Care thus represents a key driver within the broader context of the company\u2019s reliance on organic growth to signal sustainable performance trends and strategic success across segments.",

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "question": "Given that Baby, Feminine & Family Care had no net sales growth in fiscal 2024 despite contributing to organic sales growth, how might the lack of net sales growth in this segment impact P&G's overall net sales growth of 2%, especially considering that organic sales growth excludes foreign exchange and acquisition/divestiture effects?",
      "answer": "Baby, Feminine & Family Care had no net sales growth in fiscal 2024, which contrasts with its contribution of 2% to organic sales growth. This implies that while the segment performed well on an organic basis, the effects of foreign exchange (2% unfavorable impact) and/or acquisitions/divestitures fully offset the organic growth, resulting in zero net sales growth. Since P&G's total net sales growth was 2%, and one of its five major segments contributed nothing to that growth, the burden of growth fell more heavily on the other four segments. This raises questions about the segment's resilience in foreign markets and its strategic positioning within the broader portfolio, especially as P&G prepares to adopt new segment reporting standards that may reveal even more granular performance insights.",

This suggests that the segment\u2019s asset base requiring regular depreciation and amortization is much larger than the new additions from acquisitions like the Juice Transaction and Rockstar. While the segment engages in acquisition activity, the scale of its existing asset base dominates its financial activity related to depreciation and amortization.

      "question": "How does Target's reported earnings before income taxes of $5.3 billion, including $1.1 billion from foreign entities, reconcile with the EBIT figure of $5.672 billion and the decline in operating income to $5.566 billion across different sections of the 2024 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "Target's 2024 10-K filing shows a nuanced financial picture. On page 60, earnings before income taxes are reported at $5.3 billion, with $1.1 billion coming from foreign entities. This figure reflects the company's overall profitability before tax considerations. On page 31, EBIT is disclosed as $5.672 billion, showing a slight decrease of 2.2% from the prior year. This metric includes operating income and interest expenses, providing a broader view of operational efficiency. Moving to page 69, the operating income is detailed at $5.566 billion, indicating a decline from $5.707 billion in the prior year. The slight discrepancy between EBIT and operating income arises because EBIT adjusts for interest expenses and other income, while operating income reflects core business operations. The decline in operating income suggests challenges in maintaining profitability from core operations, despite EBIT remaining relatively stable. This synthesis highlights the importance of understanding how different financial metrics, such as earnings before income taxes, EBIT, and operating income, interrelate and reflect various aspects of the company's financial health.",

      "answer": "In South & Southeast Asia, PM reports unfavorable pricing and volume/mix, along with higher marketing, administration, and research costs, which negatively impacts profitability. In contrast, Eastern Europe experiences favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, and favorable pricing, while East Asia & Australia sees favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs, despite higher marketing, administration, and research costs. These favorable trends in Eastern Europe and East Asia & Australia contribute to improved operating income growth. Specifically, in the European Union, favorable volume/mix driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume contributes to a 12.5% increase in operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions. The contrast highlights how regional differences in volume/mix and cost structures significantly affect PM's profitability across markets.",

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

      "answer": "The $24 million post-retirement benefit loss in other comprehensive earnings (reported on page 124) reflects the current year's unfavorable changes in post-retirement benefit obligations. This loss contributes to the accumulated net losses that are then amortized over time. On page 123, we see that $16 million of post-retirement benefit losses are included in the total $2,589 million of losses to be amortized. The prior service cost (credit) of $1 million for post-retirement benefits on page 123 further indicates adjustments being made to align benefit obligations with financial reporting standards. Together, these figures demonstrate how the company accounts for and systematically amortizes post-retirement benefit losses over time.",

      "answer": "Fabric & Home Care achieved 8% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022, reflecting strong top-line performance. However, its Earnings Before Income Taxes for the same period stood at $5,729 million, representing a decline from $5,986 million in fiscal 2021. This indicates that while the segment grew sales significantly, its profitability contribution to P&G weakened year-over-year.

      "question": "How does QFNA's $2 million employee compensation expense compare with its consistent 1% allocation of corporate unallocated expenses over the past three years, and what does this suggest about its relative operational scale compared to other business segments?",
      "answer": "QFNA consistently represents just 1% of corporate unallocated expenses across 2019\u20132021, and in 2021, it accounted for only $2 million (1.56%) of the company's total $128 million employee compensation expense. This low proportion in both cost categories indicates that QFNA operates at a significantly smaller scale compared to other segments like LatAm ($64 million total expenses, including $44 million in employee compensation) or FLNA ($56 million total, $35 million in employee compensation). The alignment between its minimal cost footprint and its low allocation of corporate expenses suggests QFNA is a minor contributor to overall operations, both in terms of workforce size and strategic resource allocation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(page_72) \u2192 QFNA: QFNA is reported to account for a consistent 1% of corporate unallocated expenses from 2019 to 2021.",
        "Hop 2: QFNA \u2192 Employee Compensation Expense: In 2021, QFNA\u2019s employee compensation expense was $2 million, representing a small fraction of the company-wide $128 million in total employee compensation expense.",
        "Hop 3: Employee Compensation Expense \u2190 PEP(page_74): The detailed expense breakdown by segment shows QFNA\u2019s $2 million employee compensation expense is significantly lower than other segments, reinforcing its smaller operational scale."

      "answer": "In 2024, PepsiCo allocated $450 million in capital spending to the AMESA segment, reflecting a focus on infrastructure and growth initiatives in the region. In contrast, the company's pension and retiree benefits expense allocation for AMESA in 2024 was only $14 million, indicating a much smaller financial commitment to legacy obligations in the same region. This disparity suggests that PepsiCo is prioritizing growth and operational expansion over legacy cost burdens in AMESA, potentially signaling confidence in the region's future profitability and strategic importance.",

      "answer": "P&G reports Home Care as a component of the broader Fabric & Home Care segment, which includes Fabric Care products like laundry detergents and fabric enhancers. While Home Care has consistently contributed 12% of total sales over the past three fiscal years (2022\u20132024), its performance is aggregated with Fabric Care in the segment reporting structure. This aggregation limits detailed visibility into Home Care's individual growth, profitability, or operational performance, especially compared to standalone segments like Grooming or Oral Care. As a result, stakeholders must infer Home Care's trajectory from limited disclosures rather than direct segment-level financials, potentially obscuring specific opportunities or risks within this category.",

      "answer": "The 2% negative foreign exchange impact on Fabric & Home Care net sales growth, as shown in the consolidated net sales table, reduces the segment's overall growth from what would otherwise have been achieved organically. Despite this headwind, the segment still achieved an 8% organic sales growth, which indicates strong underlying performance driven by volume and pricing initiatives. Given the segment's $27.6 billion revenue base, the foreign exchange headwind likely represents a meaningful dollar amount that offset the full potential of reported sales growth. This contrast highlights how currency fluctuations constrain top-line growth even when operational performance is robust.",

          "chunk_text": "\nFabric &amp; Home Care net sales increased 6% to $27.6 billion in fiscal  2022  on  a  3%  increase  in  unit  volume.  Unfavorable foreign  exchange  decreased  net  sales  by  2%.  Higher  pricing increased  net  sales  by  5%.  Mix  had  a  neutral  impact  to  net sales. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

The 2024 pension and retiree benefits expense for FLNA is $150 million, which is part of a cumulative spending plan to date of $402 million for that segment.

      "answer": "The decline in AMESA's acquisition and divestiture-related charges from $10 million in 2021 to $2 million in 2023, as disclosed in the Corporate section (page 112), indicates reduced M&A activity or related costs in recent years. However, the depreciation and other amortization expenses for AMESA remained stable at $167 million in 2023, $179 million in 2022, and $181 million in 2021 (page 75), suggesting that the segment continues to carry a consistent level of long-term asset base or intangible assets from prior periods.

      "answer": "The Fabric & Home Care segment accounts for 35% of P&G's net sales but only 31% of net earnings, suggesting lower profitability compared to sales. Within this segment, Home Care products consistently represent 12% of net sales, while Fabric Care contributes 23% of net sales. Given that the segment\u2019s earnings contribution (31%) is less than its sales contribution (35%), and assuming similar operating costs across sub-segments, Home Care likely has lower margins than Fabric Care. This implies that while both sub-segments contribute to the overall performance, Fabric Care may be more profitable on a per-dollar-sold basis.",

        "Hop 1: PG(page_52) \u2192 Fabric & Home Care Segment: This segment reported net earnings contributions of 31% and net sales of 35%, indicating a lower profitability ratio compared to other segments.",

This amount is a portion of the total $591 million in losses to be amortized over time, as shown in the 'Losses to be amortized' line item. This indicates that only a small fraction (approximately 12.9%) of the total post-employment benefit losses is being recognized in the current reporting period, suggesting that the company will continue to experience earnings pressure from these losses in future periods as the remaining balance is gradually amortized.",

      "answer": "In 2021, the AMESA segment reported $10 million in acquisition-related payments, a significant drop from $173 million in 2020, reflecting a reduction in acquisition activity following the Pioneer Foods integration. Meanwhile, upfront payments to customers across all segments declined from $59 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021, indicating a company-wide strategic shift toward reduced customer incentive spending. However, AMESA itself reported no upfront payments to customers in 2021, suggesting that the segment's focus post-acquisition shifted away from customer acquisition incentives despite the prior high spending in 2020.",

Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives and the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India.\n\nIn 2024, fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 11% due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira, Nigerian naira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments.

      "answer": "MDLZ reports that unallocated assets include prepaid pension assets, which increased significantly from $672 million in 2020 to $1,009 million in 2021. These assets are not reflected in segment-level reporting and are instead managed centrally, along with other unallocated items like deferred taxes and derivatives. This centralized treatment means that the growth in prepaid pension assets contributes to the overall consolidated asset base but is not visible in individual segment asset disclosures, thereby affecting how investors assess asset allocation and pension-related liquidity across the business structure.",

This increase is notable because the noncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities is also classified under the same 'other noncurrent liabilities' line item. The consolidation of these two distinct liability types into one reported figure could obscure the true composition of KO's long-term obligations, potentially masking the relative growth in financial liabilities (derivatives) versus operational liabilities (leases).

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Health Care segment had $7,718 million in net assets at the end of fiscal year 2023 (page 49), and it achieved 5% Organic Sales Growth (page 32), which excludes foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures. The company defines Organic Sales Growth as a non-GAAP metric used to assess underlying sales trends and evaluate management performance for at-risk compensation. This dual perspective shows that while Health Care is a significant asset holder, its performance is also directly tied to a key strategic metric that influences executive incentives, indicating alignment between segment performance and corporate governance objectives.",

      "answer": "The $1,358 million in Other Intangible Assets, net attributed to 'Other' in 2024 appears to be a significant asset base supporting the 'All other' product line within the Other Products segment. However, this intangible asset value contrasts sharply with the $38 million in net revenues and the $(414) million operating loss reported for the same segment in 2024. This discrepancy suggests potential overvaluation or impairment risk for these intangible assets, given the segment\u2019s poor operating performance.

This indicates that the full amount of post-retirement losses previously identified as needing amortization was recognized in the current year's financial performance, suggesting a complete realization of those deferred losses into current earnings.

      "answer": "The $1 million in amortized losses from post-retirement benefits recognized in the earnings section (page 124) represents the portion of post-retirement benefit losses that were actually charged to earnings during the reporting period. This amount is significantly lower than the $16 million in total losses to be amortized disclosed in the post-retirement benefits rollforward (page 123), which indicates that only a small portion of the total unrecognized losses are being systematically recognized each year. The difference highlights the accounting treatment where losses are amortized over time rather than recognized immediately, reflecting a gradual recognition of actuarial losses that have accumulated in prior periods.",

      "answer": "In 2024, FLNA reported capital spending of $1,182 million and depreciation and other amortization expenses of $806 million. This indicates that FLNA is investing more in new capital than it is depreciating existing assets, suggesting a growth-oriented investment strategy focused on expanding or upgrading its asset base. The difference between these figures ($376 million) implies that FLNA is not only maintaining its current asset infrastructure but also expanding it, which could signal long-term growth plans for the segment.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(page_82) \u2192 FLNA: FLNA is disclosed as a key segment with a total capital allocation of $150 million under restructuring costs for 2024.",

        "Hop 3: Depreciation and Other Amortization \u2190 PEP(page_76): The detailed breakdown on page 76 shows FLNA's capital spending of $1,182 million in 2024, which is significantly higher than its depreciation and amortization expense, suggesting active investment in new assets."

      "answer": "The $14 million actual pre-tax charge recorded for AMESA in 2024 represents a relatively small portion of the total $698 million in pre-tax charges for that year. However, AMESA was allocated only 5% of the expected pre-tax charges as disclosed in the regional breakdown. This suggests that the actual charge recorded for AMESA aligns closely with its allocated percentage, indicating that PEP's regional distribution methodology may have been reasonably accurate for this segment. In comparison, Europe was allocated 25% and recorded $123 million, and FLNA was allocated 15% and recorded $150 million, showing similar alignment. Therefore, while the AMESA charge is proportionally low, it does not appear to deviate significantly from expectations when compared to other segments.",

      "question": "How does PEP's acquisition-related financial performance in the AMESA segment compare with its credit risk exposure as measured by Allowances for Expected Credit Losses in that same region?",
      "answer": "PEP reported $10 million in gains from the Pioneer Foods acquisition within the AMESA segment in 2021, indicating a positive short-term financial contribution. However, the company also maintained Allowances for Expected Credit Losses of $1 million for the AMESA region, suggesting a cautious approach to credit risk in that market. This relatively low allowance compared to the acquisition gain implies that PEP may view the credit risk in AMESA as manageable relative to the strategic benefits of expansion through acquisitions like Pioneer Foods.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(page_115) \u2192 AMESA: PEP discloses $10 million in acquisition-related gains from Pioneer Foods under the AMESA segment in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: AMESA \u2192 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses: PEP reports $1 million in Allowances for Expected Credit Losses attributed to the AMESA segment, indicating a provision for potential credit risk.",
        "Hop 3: Allowances for Expected Credit Losses \u2190 PEP(page_74): The credit loss allowances are part of a broader set of financial provisions, with AMESA\u2019s $1 million representing a small portion of the global total of $32 million."

      "question": "How does Procter & Gamble's organic sales growth performance in the Fabric & Home Care segment compare with its overall net sales growth, and what does this suggest about the segment's contribution to the company's financial strategy?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's overall net sales growth for fiscal 2024 was 2%, driven by 4% pricing increases, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Within this, the Fabric & Home Care segment reported 4% net sales growth, with only a 1% foreign exchange impact, resulting in 5% organic sales growth. This indicates that the Fabric & Home Care segment outperformed the company average in terms of organic growth, suggesting it played a key role in driving the company's financial momentum. As one of the five core reportable segments, Fabric & Home Care includes product categories such as Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, and Home Care products like Air Care and Surface Care, which appear to be contributing meaningfully to P&G\u2019s growth strategy despite macroeconomic headwinds.",

      "answer": "MDLZ reported that higher net pricing contributed 2.0 percentage points to their $725 million net revenue increase in 2021 (chunk 2), which in turn helped drive a $374 million (8.5%) increase in adjusted operating income (chunk 1). However, the company acknowledges risks where continued volatility in commodity prices and supply constraints could limit their ability to grow net revenues and earnings (chunk 3). Specifically, they note that their hedging strategies have not always protected them from raw material cost increases, and supply constraints in 2021 limited growth potential. This creates a sustainability concern: while higher net pricing has positively impacted recent financial performance, the company's ability to maintain this lever could be undermined by external pressures on input costs and supply chain reliability, which they have only partial control over.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndeforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between PepsiCo's $1,110 million pension payment obligation in 2022 and the $216 million pension liabilities figure disclosed in the deferred tax liabilities section, and how does this reflect the company's net financial exposure?",
      "answer": "The $1,110 million pension payment obligation for 2022, disclosed in the near-term future payments table, represents the gross cash outflow PepsiCo expects to make in that year. This contrasts with the $216 million pension liabilities figure in the deferred tax liabilities section, which reflects the net tax-impacted value of pension obligations on the company's balance sheet. The difference between these figures highlights the impact of tax deductions related to pension contributions and liabilities, which reduce the reported net liability. This relationship illustrates how pension obligations are treated differently in liquidity planning (gross cash payments) versus financial reporting (net tax-adjusted liabilities).",

      "question": "How does the decline in PEP's capital spending for PBNA from $1,723 million in 2023 to $1,541 million in 2024 reconcile with the increase in PBNA's pension and retiree benefits expense from $41 million to $238 million year-over-year?",
      "answer": "The decline in capital spending for PBNA from $1,723 million in 2023 to $1,541 million in 2024 suggests a reduction in investment in infrastructure, technology, or facilities within that segment. However, the pension and retiree benefits expense for PBNA increased significantly from $41 million to $238 million in the same period, indicating higher financial obligations tied to workforce retirement liabilities. This contrast highlights a shift in financial focus from capital investment to personnel-related liabilities within the PBNA segment, potentially signaling a more mature or consolidating phase of operations.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(page_76) \u2192 Capital Spending: PEP reports a decrease in capital spending for PBNA from $1,723 million in 2023 to $1,541 million in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Capital Spending \u2192 PBNA: Capital spending is a measure of investment in the PBNA segment, reflecting strategic decisions about growth or maintenance.",
        "Hop 3: PBNA \u2190 PEP(page_82): PBNA's pension and retiree benefits expense rises sharply from $41 million in 2023 to $238 million in 2024, indicating increased liability in employee benefits."

      "answer": "Walmart's Sam's Club U.S. segment reported a net sales growth of 4.7% in fiscal 2025, indicating a positive trend in revenue performance. According to the segment disclosure, the Sam's Club U.S. segment includes warehouse membership clubs, samsclub.com, and omnichannel initiatives. This strategic focus on omnichannel initiatives aligns with the segment's revenue growth, suggesting that these initiatives are contributing to the overall performance improvements. The growth in this segment, therefore, reflects both the effectiveness of the omnichannel strategy and its integration into the broader revenue-generating activities of the company.",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites and mobile applications, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omnichannel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.",

      "question": "How does the acquisition of Grenade in 2021, which contributed $63 million in net revenues, align with the reported negative acquisition impact of (1.7) percentage points on 2020 net revenue growth, and what does this reveal about the timing and scale of acquisition effects on MDLZ's segment operating income?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Grenade in March 2021 added $63 million in net revenues on a constant currency basis, positively contributing to segment operating income that year. However, in 2020, the impact of acquisitions was reported as a (1.7) percentage point drag on net revenue growth, indicating that any acquisitions during that year had a negative or dilutive effect on revenue performance. This contrast reveals that the timing and scale of acquisitions significantly affect financial outcomes\u2014Grenade contributed positively post-acquisition in 2021, whereas 2020 acquisitions likely involved integration challenges, smaller scale, or unfavorable market conditions. The difference in acquisition impacts across years highlights how such strategic moves can either enhance or constrain operating income depending on execution and timing.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

This reconciliation is explained by the impact of foreign exchange, which negatively affected the segment's reported net sales growth by 2 percentage points (page 32), masking the underlying organic performance. While the segment did not show growth on the net sales line due to currency effects, its organic growth contribution factored into the company's total organic sales increase of 4% (page 22).",

      "answer": "The current year's post-employment benefit loss was $142 million, as reported in the financial statements. This represents a movement in the overall post-employment benefits category, which also includes other components like prior service costs and deferred income taxes. The cumulative losses to be amortized for post-employment benefits total $593 million, as disclosed in the amortization schedule. This indicates that the $142 million loss contributes to the larger pool of unamortized losses that will be recognized in future earnings, potentially increasing earnings volatility. The significant difference between the current-year loss and the cumulative amortization amount highlights the long-term nature of these obligations and the potential for continued earnings impact as these losses are amortized over time.",

      "answer": "The 2% unit case volume growth in energy drinks within the Global Ventures segment contributed positively to Coca-Cola's operational performance. However, this growth occurred in the context of an 11% unfavorable foreign exchange impact on operating income due to a stronger U.S. dollar against currencies like the Argentine peso, Mexican peso, and Japanese yen. While the Global Ventures segment experienced some favorable foreign exchange effects from weaker dollars against the euro and British pound, these only partially offset the broader negative FX impact. Thus, the 2% volume growth in Global Ventures likely provided operational momentum that was dampened, but not entirely negated, by FX headwinds.",

      "question": "How does Grooming's 4% reported net sales growth align with its 9% organic sales growth, and what does this imply about the impact of foreign exchange on the segment's performance?",
      "answer": "Grooming reported a 4% net sales growth, as seen in the consolidated net sales change drivers, but its organic sales growth was significantly higher at 9%, indicating strong underlying performance. However, the segment was notably impacted by foreign exchange, which reduced net sales growth by 5 percentage points. This implies that despite foreign exchange headwinds, the Grooming segment demonstrated robust growth through volume and pricing strategies. The difference between organic and reported net sales growth highlights the importance of currency effects in shaping the segment's financial outcomes.",

        "Hop 1: [PG](page_20) \u2192 [Grooming]: The Grooming segment is noted to have contributed to a mid-single-digit increase in net sales, with organic sales increasing high single digits.",

        "Hop 3: [Net Sales Growth] \u2190 [PG](page_23): The detailed net sales change drivers on page 23 confirm that Grooming experienced a 5% negative foreign exchange impact, which explains the gap between its 9% organic growth and 4% reported net sales growth."

The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "PEP's expected pre-tax charges allocated to the LatAm segment amount to 10% of the total charges, indicating a relatively smaller portion of restructuring focus. However, in the subsequent disclosure on restructuring spending, LatAm accounts for $51 million in 2024, which represents a significant portion of the total $698 million spent across all segments. This suggests that despite a modest allocation of charges, the actual cash outlay and execution of restructuring initiatives in LatAm is more substantial, reflecting a deeper investment in transformation efforts in the region than initially signaled by the pre-tax charge allocation.",

      "answer": "MDLZ excludes certain items like higher net pricing from segment operating income to provide what they claim is better transparency into segment performance. However, in 2021, segment operating income growth of 17.9% was partially driven by higher net pricing, which contributed $678 million to adjusted operating income growth. This suggests that while management claims to exclude pricing impacts for clearer segment evaluation, pricing was in fact a material contributor to the growth reported across business segments. The reconciliation of adjusted operating income shows that higher net pricing was a key factor in performance, raising questions about the alignment between management's stated rationale for exclusions and the actual drivers of profitability.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

      "answer": "Altria maintains a long-term compensation increase assumption of 4.0% in its pension disclosures (page 90), a key input in calculating pension obligations. This assumption remained unchanged across multiple years and is used to estimate future benefit payments. Separately, Altria's weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt was approximately 4.0% at the end of 2021 (page 48), indicating that the company's cost of borrowing aligns closely with its assumed rate of future compensation growth. This alignment suggests a deliberate liability management strategy where Altria may be structuring its debt profile to match or hedge against long-term pension obligations. By maintaining a fixed interest rate on debt at a level consistent with expected compensation increases, Altria could be mitigating interest rate risk and aligning cash flow expectations across both pension and debt liabilities.",

Altria monitors the credit quality of its bank group and is not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider in that group. For further discussion on short-term borrowings, see Note 8.\n\nAny commercial paper issued by Altria and borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PM USA. For further discussion, see Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information below and Note 9.\n\nDebt - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria's total debt was $28.0 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively.\n\nIn May 2021, Altria repaid in full its 4.75% senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion at maturity.\n\nIn February 2021, Altria issued long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion (the 'Notes'). The net proceeds from the Notes were used (i) to fund the purchase and redemption of certain unsecured notes and payment of related fees and expenses (as described below) and (ii) for other general corporate purposes.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, Altria (i) completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,042 million and (ii) redeemed all of its outstanding 3.490% Notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt of $649 million, which included premiums and fees of $623 million and the write-off of related unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $26 million. As a result of the debt transactions, Altria reduced its near-term maturity towers, extended the weighted-average maturity of its debt and lowered its weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt.\n\nAll of Altria's long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was fixed-rate debt. The weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt was approximately 4.0% and 4.1% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nFor further details on long-term debt, see Note 9.",

      "answer": "The $1,430 million increase in Other Intangible Assets, net for the Smokeable products segment is attributed to acquisitions, as disclosed in the changes due to acquisitions on page 67. However, despite this addition, the overall value of the segment\u2019s intangible assets decreased from $2,989 million in 2022 to $2,963 million in 2023 (page 66), likely due to amortization or write-downs not explicitly detailed in the segment reporting. This suggests that while acquisitions added to the asset base, other factors reduced the net value of intangible assets within the same segment over the reporting period.",

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for inhome consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.\n\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\nFavorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.",

      "answer": "Despite Fabric & Home Care achieving an 8% organic sales growth in 2022, the segment's Net Earnings/(Loss) decreased from $4,622 million in 2021 to $4,386 million in 2022. This suggests that while the segment successfully grew its top line, profitability was pressured by factors such as increased operating costs, higher depreciation and amortization expenses (which rose from $646 million to $672 million), or strategic investments that reduced short-term margins. The contrast highlights the tension between sales growth and earnings performance, indicating potential inefficiencies or margin compression in translating revenue gains into bottom-line results.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Grooming segment reported 5% organic sales growth on page 36, driven by strong underlying performance. However, this was offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange, as detailed on page 26, which significantly reduced the overall net sales growth to just 2%. Additionally, pricing strategies contributed 5% to net sales growth, but this was insufficient to fully counteract the FX headwinds. This indicates that while the segment is performing well organically, currency fluctuations are materially affecting reported growth.",

      "answer": "PG reported that foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by $589 million in fiscal 2024 due to the weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This negative impact is reflected not only in the bottom line but also in the operating margin, where foreign exchange had an 80 basis point unfavorable effect on gross margin, partially offset by productivity and cost savings. The exposure to foreign exchange risk is further emphasized in the economic conditions section, where PG notes that over half of its sales come from outside the U.S., particularly in key markets like Greater China, the U.K., and Germany. Thus, the $589 million earnings hit and the margin compression both stem from the same underlying currency volatility, highlighting the financial and operational interplay of FX risk across different sections of the 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nGlobal E conomic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are G reater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and G ermany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign ex change and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which  have  negatively  impacted  net  sales,  net  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  response  to  the  devaluation  of  foreign  currencies  (including  those  deemed  highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCommodities and  Supply  Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. V olatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution  operations  can  lead  to  increased  costs.  Legal  or  regulatory  requirements  and  sustainability  initiatives  may  result  in  increased  costs.  We  strive  to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response  to  certain  inflationary  or  cost  increases  may  also  offset  portions  of  the  cost  impacts;  however,  such  price  increases  may  negatively  impact  product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy'. G overnment controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG &amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for ex ample, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&amp;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in  SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased  advertising),  inflation,  foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.",

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable geographic mix impacts, partially offset by decreases due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nEarnings before income taxes increased $408 million, or 2%, to $18.8 billion due to the increase in operating income discussed above. Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in earnings before income tax es, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax  rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.\n\nNet earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n\nDiluted EPS increased $0.12, or 2%, to $6.02 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.\n\n## SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on items included in the Corporate segment.\n\n",

The increase in gross margin was due to:\n\n- a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings,\n- 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and\n- a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n\n- an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,\n- a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,\n- 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and\n- 30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs.\n\nTotal SG&amp;A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.\n\n- Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n- Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.\n\nProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.\n\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the G illette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the G illette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOperating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG &amp;A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above.\n\nOperating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n- Interest ex pense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\n- Other  non-operating  income  was  unchanged  at  $668  million  as  gains  from  the  sale  of  minor  brands  and  an  increase  in  net  non-operating  benefits  on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.",

      "answer": "The Beauty segment reported 2% organic sales growth in 2022, indicating modest revenue expansion. However, its Earnings Before Income Taxes (EBIT) declined from $4,018M in 2021 to $3,946M in 2022, a decrease of $72M. This suggests that despite top-line growth, the segment faced cost pressures or margin contraction during the year. The decline in EBIT relative to sales growth indicates a potential inefficiency or increased operating costs that offset the benefits of higher sales. This divergence between revenue and pre-tax earnings highlights a need for further analysis into the segment's cost management and profitability drivers.",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble reported a 200 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2024 (from 25.7% to 27.7%). This increase includes the impact of losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, which are disclosed on another page as being 'substantially offset' by currency mark-to-market adjustments within the same SG&A expense line. This suggests that while the company experienced derivative losses that would have increased SG&A expenses, the offsetting currency gains helped moderate the overall expense growth that might otherwise have been more pronounced. The combination of these effects contributed to the observed increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales.",

Specifically, in Latin America, favorable pricing actions\u2014including inflationary pricing in Argentina\u2014were complemented by positive channel and product mix effects, despite increased promotional funding. In North America, favorable channel, package, and product mix further supported pricing initiatives. These channel mix improvements, as detailed in the revenue drivers section, directly contributed to the enhanced profitability reflected in the gross margin expansion.

      "answer": "The Grooming segment reported 5% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange, as defined in the non-GAAP metric explanation. This growth indicates that Grooming outperformed the overall company's 7% average, suggesting strong underlying performance. The broader definition of organic sales growth in the MD&A highlights that this metric is used by management to assess sustainable results and trends, implying that Grooming's performance is viewed as a meaningful contributor to the company's strategic objectives. The exclusion of one-time or non-recurring impacts ensures that this growth reflects true market and operational dynamics rather than accounting artifacts.",

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "answer": "In 2024, KO reported that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the impact of the Argentine peso, decreased net operating revenues by 5%. This decline was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the Argentine peso and other currencies. On another section of the filing, it is noted that the same set of currency fluctuations, including the peso, caused an 11% unfavorable impact on operating income. KO actively manages these exposures through a hedging program that includes forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options, with a total notional value of $18,442 million in 2024. Despite these hedging efforts, the Argentine peso's volatility still significantly affected both revenue and income, indicating that the hedging strategy did not fully offset the peso's depreciation. This suggests a gap in hedge effectiveness or a limitation in hedging coverage for high-risk emerging market currencies like the Argentine peso.",

          "chunk_text": "The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 5% and 4% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 11% and 8% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Other Income (Loss) - Net' above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million and $312 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2024, we generated $28.7 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $18,442 million and $17,505 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $366 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $511 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $62 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $325 million decrease in fair value.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to ex isting and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix  of fix ed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.",

Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we ex pect foreign currency ex change rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2025 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

      "answer": "PG's Oral Care segment contributes 8% to the company's total net sales in fiscal 2023, as part of the broader Health Care segment. According to the segment reporting, Health Care accounts for 14% of PG's total net sales and includes Oral Care (toothbrushes, toothpastes, and other oral care) as a key sub-category.

      "answer": "Colgate invested heavily in Latin America ($118M) and Africa/Eurasia ($33M) for Oral, Personal and Home Care in 2021, as shown in the capital expenditures table. However, the FX impact data from 2020 reveals that Latin America experienced a 14% FX headwind and Africa/Eurasia faced an 8.5% FX headwind, which significantly reduced reported net sales growth in those regions. This suggests that the company increased capital commitments to emerging markets shortly after experiencing substantial currency-related revenue pressures.

      "answer": "The noncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities is explicitly classified under other noncurrent liabilities on Coca-Cola's balance sheet, indicating that this line item includes long-term obligations beyond operating leases. On another page, the fair value of foreign currency contracts is shown to negatively impact other noncurrent liabilities, with a reported $12 million in liabilities as of December 31, 2024. This implies that Coca-Cola's long-term liabilities are not only shaped by contractual lease obligations but also by derivative instruments like foreign currency contracts, which introduce volatility tied to currency markets. The coexistence of these two distinct liabilities within the same balance sheet line item suggests a broader exposure to financial risks that may affect the company's long-term capital structure.",

      "answer": "The LatAm segment saw a decline in capital spending from $557 million in 2019 to $461 million in 2021, representing a 17.2% decrease. During the same period, PepsiCo's total capital expenditures increased from $4,232 million in 2019 to $4,625 million in 2021, a 9.3% increase. This inverse relationship suggests that while the company was increasing overall investment, it was reducing capital allocation to the LatAm region specifically.

      "answer": "The Pioneer Foods acquisition in the AMESA segment contributed $181 million to PEP's depreciation and other amortization expenses in 2021. This reflects a significant portion of the segment's capital allocation and investment activity tied to the acquisition. In the broader context, the total depreciation and other amortization expenses across all segments amounted to $2,619 million in 2021, indicating that AMESA's share was approximately 6.9% of the total. This highlights the strategic importance of the AMESA segment in PEP's global capital allocation, particularly in relation to the integration and asset base of Pioneer Foods.",

      "answer": "QFNA represented only 1% of total revenue in 2021, consistent with its historical contribution (PEP page 72), and reported $0 in upfront payments to customers in both 2020 and 2021 (PEP page 74). This contrasts with the overall trend where PEP paid $59 million in upfront customer payments in 2020 and reduced that to $23 million in 2021. QFNA's financial profile indicates it operates with no recorded upfront payments, distinguishing it from segments like PBNA, which had significant upfront payments of $56 million in 2020 and $21 million in 2021. This suggests QFNA's business model involves minimal financial commitments to customers relative to other segments.",

This segment includes direct-to-consumer retail operations through Costa, which are part of the finished product operations described in the revenue recognition section. The Global Ventures segment's performance improved in 2021, turning to a $293 million operating profit, attributed in part to the reopening of Costa retail stores in the United Kingdom. The revenue recognition section confirms that Costa retail store sales are included in the Global Ventures operating segment, indicating that the 2020 loss likely reflects challenges faced by these direct retail operations during the pandemic, which subsequently improved in 2021 as conditions normalized.",

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 6 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nOperating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3,331 million and $2,471 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and category mix, effective cost management and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nAsia Pacific's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,325 million and $2,133 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 11 percent, a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 4 percent and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nGlobal Ventures' operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $293 million, while the operating segment's operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $123 million. The change in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth as a result of the reopening of Costa retail stores in the United Kingdom and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent.\n\nBottling Investments' operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $473 million and $308 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by volume growth of 11 percent, lower other operating charges and favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.\n\nCorporate's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,383 million and $1,221 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2021 increased primarily as a result of higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased marketing spending, increased charitable donations and higher other operating charges.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income was $276 million in 2021, compared to $370 million in 2020, a decrease of $94 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates in certain of our international locations as well as lower investment balances.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense was $1,597 million in 2021, compared to $1,437 million in 2020, an increase of $160 million, or 11 percent. This increase was primarily due to charges of $650 million in 2021 versus charges of $484 million in 2020 associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity Income (Loss) - Net\n\nEquity income (loss) - net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2021, equity income was $1,438 million, compared to equity income of $978 million in 2020, an increase of $460 million, or 47 percent. This increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by most of our equity method investees in 2021, as results in 2020 were more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $13 million and $216 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represent the Company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers.

      "answer": "Pension participation changes negatively impacted MDLZ's segment operating income by reducing it, as noted in the operating performance section where it was listed among the offsetting factors to the $317 million increase in segment operating income. However, the same pension changes had a positive impact on selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as indicated in the financial analysis section, where they were listed among factors contributing to the $165 million increase in SG&A. This dual effect reflects how pension-related costs were excluded from segment operating income (as centrally managed items) but flowed through to SG&A expenses, creating opposite directional impacts on these financial metrics.",

Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net.

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for inhome consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.\n\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\nFavorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.",

      "question": "Why did the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment report zero net sales growth despite contributing to the company's overall organic sales growth of 2% in fiscal year 2024, and how does this align with the detailed breakdown of net sales change drivers showing a 3% pricing increase in this segment?",
      "answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment reported zero net sales growth in fiscal year 2024, as stated on page 20, despite contributing to the company's overall organic sales growth of 2%. This apparent contradiction is explained by the detailed sales change drivers on page 23, which show that a 3% pricing increase in the segment was offset by a 2% volume decline (both excluding acquisitions/divestitures). This indicates that while the segment maintained pricing power and contributed to organic growth, it struggled with volume retention, resulting in flat overall net sales. The segment's organic sales growth of 2%, as shown on page 32, further confirms that excluding external factors like foreign exchange and M&A activity, the underlying business did grow modestly.",

        "Hop 2: [Baby, Feminine &Family Care] \u2192 [Net Sales Growth]: Discloses that the segment had 0% net sales growth but 2% organic sales growth, indicating external factors like FX or volume declines may have offset gains.",

The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "MDLZ excludes acquisition-related costs and impacts from segment operating income (as stated on page 134) to provide better transparency into core segment performance. However, in the year-over-year revenue comparison (page 60), the acquisition of Gourmet Food contributed $47 million in net revenues and added 0.9 percentage points to overall revenue growth. Meanwhile, the reconciliation of organic net revenue (page 53) shows acquisitions had a negative (1.7) percentage point impact in 2020. This reveals a dual perspective: while acquisitions can positively boost top-line revenue in specific years (2021), MDLZ management chooses to exclude these impacts when evaluating ongoing segment profitability, likely due to the inconsistent contribution across reporting periods.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "answer": "The depreciation and amortization expenses for the LatAm segment increased from $270 million in 2019 to $283 million in 2021, indicating a relatively stable level of capital investment or asset base in the region. However, during the same period, the LatAm segment's operating income contribution declined from 7% in 2019 to 5% in 2021, suggesting that despite maintaining capital spending, the region's profitability contribution to the company weakened. This raises questions about the efficiency of asset utilization in LatAm and whether the sustained depreciation expense is translating into proportional revenue or profit growth.",

      "question": "Given the Beauty segment's $13,723 million net assets and 3% organic sales growth, how does its financial contribution compare to the company's overall net sales increase of 2% in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "The Beauty segment reported $13,723 million in net assets as of June 30, 2024, and achieved 3% organic sales growth, contributing to the company's overall net sales increase of 2% to $84.0 billion in fiscal 2024. While the segment's organic growth outperformed the company average on a percentage basis, its relatively modest net sales growth of 1% (which includes a 2% positive foreign exchange impact) suggests that the segment's financial contribution to total revenue growth was constrained by external currency pressures. This contrasts with segments like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which delivered higher organic growth and stronger net sales performance.",

      "answer": "On page 40, MDLZ discloses a net tax benefit of $767 million from the Swiss tax reform, primarily driven by a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to the step-up of intangible assets and remeasurement of deferred tax balances. This benefit was partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. On page 130, the company notes that the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 creates a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset from the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be necessary, with the release amount dependent on future Swiss taxable income. This indicates that while the initial net benefit was substantial, future adjustments to the valuation allowance could materially affect the long-term tax implications of the Swiss reform.",

In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged.

Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures.

Income Taxes\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is our position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter of 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. With the acquisition of Chipita in January 2022 (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures ), we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the step-up of intangible assets will no longer be needed. The amount of the valuation allowance to be released in 2022 is dependent on the increase in Switzerland's future taxable income.\n\nEarnings/(losses) from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of:\n\n",

      "question": "How does the mid-single-digit organic sales growth reported for Fabric & Home Care in the consolidated results compare to the detailed net sales growth attribution for the segment, and what does this imply about the drivers of performance?",
      "answer": "The consolidated results on page 20 indicate that Fabric & Home Care achieved mid-single-digit organic sales growth, contributing to the overall 2% increase in net sales. However, the more granular breakdown on page 23 reveals that the segment\u2019s net sales growth was 4%, driven by a 1% volume increase (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), a 3% price increase, and a 1% mix benefit, partially offset by a 1% foreign exchange headwind. This implies that while organic growth was a key contributor, pricing and product mix played a more prominent role in driving the segment\u2019s net sales performance, suggesting a strategic emphasis on pricing power and product portfolio optimization.",

The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "question": "Given the declining revenue and negative operating income from Other Products in 2024, how does the increase in Other Intangible Assets, net for the 'Other' category from $1,658 million in 2023 to $1,358 million in 2024 reflect the company's asset valuation approach amid underperforming segments?",
      "answer": "The 'Other Products' segment reported a significant decline in net revenues (from $60 million in 2023 to $38 million in 2024) and a sharp deterioration in operating income (from -$74 million in 2023 to -$414 million in 2024), indicating worsening performance. Despite this, the 'Other Intangible Assets, net' under the 'Other' category decreased only slightly from $1,658 million in 2023 to $1,358 million in 2024, suggesting limited impairment or a conservative write-down approach. This implies that while the segment is underperforming financially, the company may not be fully adjusting the carrying value of its intangible assets downward, potentially signaling management's expectation of future value or a strategic decision to maintain asset valuations despite short-term performance issues.",

        "Hop 2: Other Products \u2192 Other Intangible Assets, net: The 'Other' category includes both the underperforming 'Other Products' segment and its associated intangible assets, creating a direct link between operational performance and asset valuation.",

      "question": "How does the decline in PBNA's restructuring charges from $51 million in 2022 to $16 million in 2023 reconcile with the segment's consistently high depreciation and amortization expenses of $1,003 million in 2023, despite reductions in prior years?",
      "answer": "The PBNA segment, which represents PepsiCo's North American beverage business, saw a significant reduction in restructuring charges from $51 million in 2022 to $16 million in 2023, indicating fewer major operational changes compared to the previous year. However, this reduction contrasts with the segment's continued high level of depreciation and amortization expenses, which rose slightly to $1,003 million in 2023 from $930 million in 2022. This suggests that while PepsiCo may have scaled back on restructuring activities, it is still maintaining or investing in its existing asset base within PBNA. The continued high depreciation and amortization may reflect ongoing capital investment in infrastructure or the long-term amortization of previously acquired intangible assets, even in the context of reduced restructuring activity.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's exposure to commodity cost volatility reconcile with the company's reported success in leveraging higher net pricing to drive revenue growth and operating income improvements?",
      "answer": "MDLZ acknowledges significant exposure to commodity cost volatility, noting that continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies could materially affect profitability (page_26). However, the company reported that higher net pricing positively contributed to revenue growth, accounting for 2.0 percentage points of a 12.6% net revenue increase in 2021. This pricing strategy also contributed to a $233 million increase in segment operating income. Further, on page 49, higher net pricing is explicitly quantified as contributing $678 million to adjusted operating income changes, despite facing $474 million in higher input costs. This suggests that while MDLZ faces cost pressures from commodity volatility, it has successfully offset some of these risks through strategic pricing actions that directly contributed to both revenue and profitability improvements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndeforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "question": "How does the decline in PBNA's capital spending from $1,723 million in 2023 to $1,541 million in 2024 align with PepsiCo's broader capital allocation strategy as reflected in the spending trends across other divisions?",
      "answer": "PBNA's capital spending decreased from $1,714 million in 2022 to $1,723 million in 2023, and further to $1,541 million in 2024, indicating a consistent downward trend. This reduction contrasts with the overall capital spending strategy at PepsiCo, where divisions like LatAm increased spending from $581 million in 2022 to $837 million in 2024, and Europe maintained relatively stable investment levels. The decline in PBNA's capital allocation suggests a strategic shift in prioritizing investment toward other geographic or business segments, potentially signaling a mature or consolidating market position for PBNA within the North American beverage landscape.",

        "Hop 3: Capital Spending \u2190 PEP(page_76): PepsiCo's overall capital spending across divisions shows varied trends, with some regions like LatAm seeing increased investment, contrasting PBNA\u2019s declining allocation."

      "answer": "PG reported that Oral Care accounted for 8% of total net sales in fiscal 2024, consistent with prior years. Oral Care is a sub-category within the broader Health Care segment, which generated 14% of total net sales. Despite Oral Care's stable contribution, the company emphasized that Health Care was one of the segments with mid-single-digit growth in net sales and high-single-digit growth in organic sales during fiscal 2024. This suggests that while Oral Care itself maintained its proportional contribution, other categories within Health Care may have driven the segment's growth performance.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's exposure to commodity cost pressures reconcile with the $107 million favorable volume/mix contribution to operating income in 2020, given the potential for input cost volatility to affect both pricing strategies and consumer demand?",
      "answer": "MDLZ faces significant exposure to commodity cost pressures, as noted in the risk factors on page 26, where continued volatility in commodity prices could affect product costs, prompting price increases that may reduce sales volumes or require price reductions that affect revenues and margins. However, the company also reported a $107 million favorable volume/mix contribution to operating income in 2020, indicating that increased demand for products positively impacted performance. This apparent contradiction suggests that despite input cost volatility, MDLZ was able to manage pricing strategies effectively enough to maintain or grow sales volumes, particularly in high-demand categories like chocolate, biscuits, and refreshment beverages. The favorable volume/mix contribution implies that consumer demand remained resilient, even as the company navigated inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, suggesting some success in balancing cost-driven pricing with market demand.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndeforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

      "answer": "The $314 million in pension net losses amortized in 2021 (page 102) and the $78 million in post-employment benefits amortized in 2022 (page 107) are part of a broader pattern where net losses totaling $3,718 million for pensions and $775 million for post-employment benefits were recognized (page 106), creating a prolonged impact on earnings. These losses are amortized over time rather than recognized all at once, which smooths the financial impact on earnings across reporting periods. This amortization pattern, which includes $331 million total amortized in 2022 (page 107), indicates a structural pressure on earnings stability, as legacy obligations continue to affect future income statements in a predictable but unavoidable manner.",

      "answer": "The 38% decline in QFNA's operating profit is primarily attributed to the significant drop in organic volume caused by the Quaker Recall, which had a 14-percentage-point impact, as well as other operating cost increases. While the segment benefited from productivity savings and a 12-percentage-point favorable impact of an insurance recovery related to the recall, these were not enough to offset the volume loss. Additionally, lower advertising and marketing expenses contributed to cost mitigation, yet the overall volume decline and cost pressures still led to the steep drop in profitability.",

      "answer": "In 2024, PepsiCo allocated $450 million in capital spending to AMESA, reflecting a focus on growth and infrastructure investment in the region. In contrast, the company's pension and retiree benefits expense for AMESA in 2024 was only $14 million, indicating a much smaller near-term financial obligation relative to capital commitments. This disparity suggests that PepsiCo is prioritizing growth-oriented investments in AMESA over legacy costs, aligning with a strategic emphasis on expanding market presence in the region despite long-term obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2021, PBNA reported no charges related to inventory write-downs and product returns despite engaging in major acquisitions like the Juice Transaction and Rockstar. This contrasts sharply with 2020, when PBNA recorded $28 million in such charges, likely tied to integration activities from those same acquisitions. The absence of write-downs in 2021 suggests that PBNA may have improved its integration processes, potentially realizing synergies or streamlining inventory management post-acquisition. This shift could reflect more effective acquisition execution or a strategic focus on brands with better-aligned product portfolios, reducing the need for inventory impairments in the subsequent year.",

      "answer": "Membership income is identified as a significant contributor to the operating income of the Sam's Club U.S. segment, which reported $90.2 billion in net sales for fiscal 2025. This aligns with Walmart's overall financial performance, where membership income globally contributed to an increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales by 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Furthermore, Walmart\u2019s non-GAAP metric, Return on Investment (ROI), is influenced by operating income, which benefits from strong membership income growth.

(1)\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix  shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of ex ceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.\n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.\n\n## Returns\n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\n\n## Return on Assets and Return on Investment\n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.",

This discrepancy suggests that the $216 million may represent a temporary tax difference specific to 2021, such as a timing difference in expense recognition for pension funding versus tax deductibility.

      "question": "How does Costco's strategy of higher square footage growth in foreign markets relate to the negative impact of foreign currency changes on gross margin in the Other International Operations?",
      "answer": "Costco's strategy emphasizes higher square footage growth in foreign markets due to their smaller base and lower wage costs compared to domestic operations. This expansion strategy increases exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. According to page 26, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176 million, primarily attributable to the Other International Operations. This indicates that as Costco expands its footprint internationally, the financial benefits of growth may be partially offset by currency-related headwinds, especially as the segment experiences greater expansion and operates with a different cost structure.",

        "Hop 1: COST(page_23) \u2192 Square Footage Growth: The company achieves net sales growth through warehouse expansion, with a higher rate of square footage growth in foreign markets due to the smaller base.",
        "Hop 2: Square Footage Growth \u2192 Other International Segment: The Other International segment has relatively higher rates of square footage growth and lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales.",

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31.

Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basispoint  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  driven  by  decreases  in  fresh  foods  and  foods  and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted  by  one  basis  point  due  to  increased  2%  rewards.  Warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the  negative  impact  of  a  one-time  charge  related  to  granting  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off. Changes in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  gross  margin  by  approximately  $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO  charge.  Our  Other  International  segment  was  negatively  impacted  by  increased  2%  rewards.

      "answer": "PBNA's operating profit increased from $1,937 million in 2020 to $2,442 million in 2021, a growth of $505 million. PEP's total operating profit rose from $10,080 million to $11,162 million, an increase of $1,082 million. Therefore, PBNA accounted for approximately 46.7% of the total operating profit growth.

However, on page 23, the net sales growth for Beauty is shown to be 1%, driven by a 4% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a -1% mix effect. This indicates that while organic sales growth was modest, the net sales growth was maintained through pricing discipline despite unfavorable product mix.

      "answer": "The increase in prepaid pension assets from $672 million in 2020 to $1,009 million in 2021 directly contributes to the unallocated assets category, which includes items like prepaid pension assets and is not reflected in segment-level reporting. This exclusion means that the growth in prepaid pension assets does not influence segment performance metrics, despite being a significant component of the company's consolidated asset base.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's exposure to commodity cost volatility, as outlined in the risk factors, reconcile with the 1.4 percentage point contribution from higher net pricing in 2021, and what does this imply about the company's ability to pass through input cost increases to consumers?",
      "answer": "MDLZ acknowledges in its risk factors that volatility in commodity costs could materially affect profitability, especially if the company cannot pass these costs to consumers through price increases. However, in 2021, net pricing contributed 1.4 percentage points to net revenue growth, indicating that the company was able to implement pricing strategies to offset at least some input cost pressures. This is further supported by the 2021 operating income analysis, which shows that higher net pricing contributed $495 million to adjusted operating income. This suggests that while MDLZ is exposed to commodity risk, it has had some success in managing these risks through pricing actions, though the sustainability of this approach may depend on consumer sensitivity and competitive dynamics.",

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

      "answer": "Walmart International, as a reportable segment, operates 5,566 retail units globally, of which 4,079 (73.3%) are leased rather than owned. This leasing-heavy approach contrasts with Walmart U.S., where only 12.3% of units are leased, suggesting a deliberate capital-light strategy in international markets. The leasing model likely reduces capital intensity and allows for greater operational flexibility, particularly in diverse regulatory and economic environments. This aligns with Walmart's broader international strategy of adapting to local market conditions while maintaining financial discipline. The segment reporting emphasizes that these international unit counts are reported as of December 31, 2024, except for Canada, which aligns with the balance sheet date for those markets, further reinforcing the strategic and financial alignment of international operations.",

      "answer": "The operating profit in Latin America decreased slightly, primarily due to operating cost increases, a 10-percentage-point impact from an indirect tax reserve, and a net organic volume decline, which were partially offset by effective net pricing and productivity savings. On a broader company level, operating profit increased 8%, with productivity savings being a key driver alongside effective net pricing and the prior-year impairment charges related to SodaStream. In APAC, productivity savings again played a positive role, contributing to a 14% increase in operating profit despite unfavorable net pricing and cost pressures. This shows that while productivity savings were consistently called out as a positive factor across different regions and the consolidated view, their impact was not sufficient to fully offset localized cost pressures in Latin America, but did contribute meaningfully to overall operating profit growth and margin improvement.",

      "answer": "The 61.3% increase in PMI Duty Free shipment volume on page 72 indicates strong growth in this specific segment, largely driven by a higher total market and increased market share. However, this growth contrasts with the 0.6% overall decrease in cigarette shipment volume in the broader Region as reported on page 62, which was primarily impacted by declines in Germany, Italy, and France. The divergence suggests that while PMI Duty Free experienced significant growth, it was not enough to offset the broader regional declines in cigarette shipments. This dynamic highlights the importance of segment-level performance in mitigating broader market challenges, as PMI Duty Free's positive momentum contributed to the company\u2019s overall shipment growth in other areas, even as some key markets contracted.",

      "answer": "MDLZ reported that favorable volume/mix contributed $107 million to the growth in adjusted operating income in 2021. This favorable volume/mix directly supported the 17.9% increase in segment operating income, which was driven by strong demand across key product categories such as chocolate, biscuits, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages. Segment operating income is a key metric used by MDLZ to evaluate performance and allocate resources, with exclusions such as amortization and acquisition-related costs to provide clearer visibility into core operations. The alignment between favorable volume/mix and segment income growth demonstrates how operational performance in key business segments contributes to overall profitability, consistent with the company's segmentation strategy focused on regional and product-specific performance indicators.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.",

      "question": "How does the $2,149 million in pension losses to be amortized impact the pattern of net losses amortized into earnings, considering the $178 million recognized in the current year?",
      "answer": "The $2,149 million in pension losses to be amortized, as disclosed in the table on page 125, represents the accumulated net losses that will be gradually recognized in earnings over time through amortization. On page 126, the company reports that $178 million of net pension losses were amortized into earnings during the current year. This indicates that only a small portion of the total accumulated losses has been recognized so far, suggesting a gradual financial impact on future earnings as the remaining $1,971 million (i.e., $2,149 million - $178 million) is amortized over time. The pattern of amortization reflects the company\u2019s long-term pension obligations and their ongoing influence on financial results.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's 2021 net revenues increased by $949 million (9.3%), with higher net pricing contributing 1.4 percentage points to this growth. However, the company acknowledges in its risk factors that volatility in commodity prices and supply constraints\u2014such as those experienced in the U.S. and U.K. in the second half of 2021\u2014could materially limit its ability to grow net revenues and earnings. Additionally, while net pricing has been a successful lever for revenue growth, the company also notes that increases in product pricing to offset input cost inflation could lead to lower sales volumes. Therefore, although net pricing has positively impacted net revenues recently, ongoing exposure to input cost volatility and supply chain disruptions presents a material risk that could undermine future revenue and margin performance, especially if mitigation strategies are not effective or if pricing actions reduce demand.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

      "question": "How does AMESA's actual expense contribution compare to its projected impact on pre-tax charges, and what might this discrepancy suggest about the segment's cost structure or restructuring outlook?",
      "answer": "In 2024, AMESA contributed $14 million in actual expenses out of a total $698 million across all segments, representing approximately 2% of total expenses. However, AMESA is expected to account for only 5% of total pre-tax charges, which is relatively low compared to other segments. This suggests that AMESA may not be undergoing significant restructuring or cost transformation activities at this time, or that its cost base is already streamlined relative to other regions. The alignment between its modest expense contribution and limited pre-tax charge allocation indicates a potentially stable cost trajectory for the segment.",

      "answer": "The exclusion of shipping and handling costs from the cost of sales results in a higher gross profit margin, with the margin being inflated by 910 basis points in 2023. This accounting treatment enhances the visibility of gross profit margin improvements, such as those driven by higher pricing, which contributed 390 basis points to the overall gross profit margin increase in 2023. In Europe, net selling price increases of 9.5% contributed to gross profit growth, and within that region, higher pricing was responsible for 310 basis points of the gross profit improvement, despite being partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs. The combination of favorable accounting treatment and pricing strategy amplifies the reported gross profit margin growth, making it essential to understand both the accounting policy and regional pricing dynamics to accurately assess the company's underlying performance.",

This growth in comparable sales, especially in high-traffic categories like grocery and health and wellness, supported Walmart's broader omni-channel strategy and drove expense leverage. The improved sales performance, combined with supply chain efficiencies and business mix changes, led to a 20 basis point increase in gross profit margin for both fiscal years. These factors, along with lapping prior-year restructuring costs and disciplined expense management, contributed to a $1.9 billion increase in operating income in fiscal 2024, demonstrating how membership growth at Sam's Club U.S. positively influenced both top-line performance and bottom-line profitability.",

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.3% and 1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.\n\n## Margin\n\nOur objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") ex penses. Additionally, we focus on our mix  of businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.\n\n",

For fiscal 2025, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in all of our international markets, which included strength in eCommerce, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $3.2 billion. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales across our international markets and positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $3.0 billion.\n\nGross profit rate increased 20 basis points for both fiscal 2025 and 2024 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, the increase was primarily due to improved eCommerce margin and business mix changes, partially offset by ongoing channel and format mix changes. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies partially offset by ongoing channel and format mix shifts.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 5 and 152 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased sales driving expense leverage, partially offset by planned investments in associate wages and strategic priorities in Mexico and Central America. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2024, was primarily due to the lapping of business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to Flipkart and Massmart in fiscal 2023 and an increase in sales in fiscal 2024.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.6 billion and $1.9 billion for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.",

      "answer": "The increase in EBIT from $6,523 million to $9,328 million reflects improved operational performance before interest and taxes. However, to arrive at the reported net earnings of $6,946 million, adjustments for net interest expense, income taxes, and other income/expense items are applied. According to the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation, EBIT is a pre-interest and pre-tax metric, while net earnings are the final GAAP measure that incorporates these deductions.

Despite this drag, the segment achieved an 8% organic sales growth, outperforming the total company's 7% organic sales growth.

Unfavorable foreign  exchange  decreased  net  sales  by  2%.  Higher  pricing increased  net  sales  by  5%.  Mix  had  a  neutral  impact  to  net sales. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric &amp; Home Care segment increased 1.5 points.\n\n- Fabric  Care  net  sales  increased  high  single  digits.  The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased  pricing,  increased  trade  spend  efficiencies  and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America  and  growth  of  fabric  enhancers  and  premium forms,  all  of  which  have  higher  than  category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North  America and increased  low  single  digits  in  Asia  Pacific,  both  due  to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.\n- Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a  low  single  digit  decrease  in  volume,  increased  trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased  pricing.  Organic  sales  increased  low  single digits.  V olume  decreased  20%  in  IMEA  (due  to  market contraction  and  competitive  activity)  and  decreased  low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus  a  prior  year  that  benefited  from  pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.\n\nNet earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased  due  primarily  to  a  reduction  in  gross  margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by  an  increase  in  commodity  and  transportation  costs,  and unfavorable  mix  caused  by  the  growth  of  premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segmentaverage  gross  margins,  partially  offset  by  increased  pricing. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale  benefits  of  the  net  sales  increase  and  a  reduction  in marketing spending.\n\n## BABY, FEMININE &amp; FAMILY CARE\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2024, PepsiCo allocated $450 million in capital spending to the AMESA segment, an increase from $391 million in 2023 and $307 million in 2022. This upward trend in capital investment suggests a growing strategic emphasis on the AMESA region, potentially aimed at expanding infrastructure, improving operational efficiency, or capturing market opportunities. This aligns with the broader context of PepsiCo\u2019s capital allocation strategy, where the company is directing more resources toward high-potential markets. The increase in capital spending contrasts with the relatively modest investments in the region in prior years, signaling a shift in investment priorities.",

      "question": "Given the decline in the total cigarette market in several key markets in the SSEA, CIS & MEA region, how can PM justify the 61.3% increase in cigarette shipment volume through PMI Duty Free in the same reporting period?",
      "answer": "Despite a decline in the total cigarette market in several key markets within the SSEA, CIS & MEA region\u2014such as Algeria (-16.1%), Bangladesh (-6.2%), and Turkey (-6.7%)\u2014PM reported a 61.3% increase in cigarette shipment volume through its PMI Duty Free segment. This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that PMI Duty Free operates in a different market context, likely benefiting from increased international travel and duty-free retail dynamics, which are not captured in the broader regional market trends. The growth in PMI Duty Free shipments reflects a combination of higher market share and a rebound in the duty-free cigarette market, suggesting that PM is leveraging specific opportunities in this niche despite broader market contraction.",

        "Hop 2: Cigarette Shipment Volume \u2192 PMI Duty Free: PM attributes a significant portion of its global shipment growth (61.3% increase) to the PMI Duty Free segment, indicating a strong positive impact from this business unit.",
        "Hop 3: PMI Duty Free \u2190 PM(page_72): The PMI Duty Free segment is highlighted as a key growth driver, with its cigarette shipment volume rising sharply (61.3%), even as broader regional cigarette markets contracted."

      "question": "How does the increase in PEP's pension liabilities from $216 million in 2021 to a projected $1,110 million in 2022 impact the company's future cash outflows and financial obligations?",
      "answer": "PEP disclosed a pension liability of $216 million in 2021 on page 86, which increased significantly to a projected $1,110 million in 2022 as outlined on page 98. This sharp rise indicates a substantial escalation in the company's long-term financial obligations toward pension benefits. The projected $1,110 million in pension payments for 2022 suggests that PEP expects a significant cash outflow in the near term, which could affect liquidity and capital allocation decisions. The connection between the disclosed pension liabilities and the detailed pension payment schedule demonstrates how the company's growing pension obligations are expected to directly impact its future cash flows, potentially influencing financial flexibility and debt management strategies.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's refranchising activity in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and parts of India impact the Bottling Investments segment's unit case volume performance, and what does this suggest about the segment's operational footprint as disclosed in different parts of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's Bottling Investments segment experienced a 23% decrease in unit case volume in 2024, primarily due to the refranchising of bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and certain territories in India. This refranchising activity significantly affected the segment's volume performance, as these operations were previously consolidated. Meanwhile, the segment's broader operational context is disclosed in a different section of the 10-K, where it is noted that revenue disclosures for the Bottling Investments segment are detailed in Note 20. This indicates that the refranchising not only reduced volume but also likely altered the segment's revenue composition and operational scope, reflecting a strategic shift in how the company engages with bottling markets.",

This figure is derived from the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $9,328 million, which reflects operating performance before the impact of financing decisions and tax policies. The difference between EBIT and net earnings\u2014approximately $2,382 million\u2014largely reflects Target's interest expense and provision for income taxes. Specifically, the company reported net interest expense of $421 million and income taxes of $1,961 million, totaling $2,382 million, which aligns with the reduction from EBIT to net earnings. This relationship highlights the significant influence of interest and tax costs on the final profitability metric reported to shareholders.",

      "question": "Given PBNA's significant restructuring charges in 2023 compared to prior years, how does PepsiCo's depreciation and other amortization expense for PBNA align with potential asset base adjustments in the North American beverage business?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's PBNA segment reported $16 million in restructuring charges in 2023, a significant decline from $51 million in 2022, suggesting reduced transformation activity. However, depreciation and other amortization expenses for PBNA remained high at $1,003 million in 2023, slightly increasing from $930 million in 2022. This pattern indicates that despite reduced restructuring activity, PepsiCo continues to carry a substantial asset base in North America, potentially signaling ongoing investment in core infrastructure or a strategic decision to maintain operational capacity in the beverage business despite prior restructuring efforts.",

      "answer": "Walmart's fiscal 2023 operating results (page 42) indicate that strong food sales were a key driver of comparable sales growth, which rose 7.0% for the Walmart U.S. segment. This aligns with the more general statement on page 37 that U.S. comparable sales growth was driven by increases in average ticket, including strong food sales and inflationary impacts. The 7.0% comparable sales growth figure directly reflects the contribution of food sales to broader sales momentum, suggesting that food played a central role in driving transaction value and customer spending during a period of inflationary pressure. This alignment shows that food sales were not only a stabilizing force in Walmart's core business but also a primary engine behind the segment's overall sales performance.",

However, despite this robust growth, the segment's depreciation and amortization expense was $62 million in 2021, which is relatively modest compared to the Total Company's $556 million.

      "answer": "PepsiCo allocated 15% of expected pre-tax restructuring charges to the Foodservice Latin America segment and 25% to the PepsiCo North America segment, indicating a greater anticipated transformation effort in North America. This aligns with the $238 million restructuring expense reported for PBNA in 2024 compared to FLNA's $150 million, suggesting PBNA required more significant operational changes. The cumulative 'Plan to Date' figures of $402 million for FLNA and $505 million for PBNA further support this differential transformation scale.",

This growth was supported by regional performances such as 8.0% in North America and 9.0% in Latin America. Meanwhile, capital expenditures for the same segment increased significantly from $274 million in 2020 to $332 million in 2021, suggesting strategic investment to sustain and potentially enhance this growth trajectory.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's Bottling Investments segment experienced a 23% decline in unit case volume in 2024, primarily due to the refranchising of bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and certain territories in India. This refranchising activity significantly affected the segment's reported volume, as Bottling Investments only reflects consolidated bottlers. The refranchising implies a reduction in the number of directly operated bottling entities, which aligns with the segment's operational footprint as disclosed in the financial statements under Note 20, where revenue disclosures by operating segment are detailed. This suggests that the Bottling Investments segment has undergone structural changes that have reduced its direct market presence in those regions.",

          "chunk_text": "\n- Net sales increased 2% to $84.0 billion versus the prior year. The net sales growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care and Grooming and a low single-digit increase in Beauty. Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in G rooming, mid-single digits in Fabric &amp; Home Care and Health Care and low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care.\n- Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the Gillette intangible asset.\n- Net earnings increased $236 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by a higher effective tax  rate. Foreign ex change impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million.\n- Net earnings attributable to Procter &amp; Gamble increased $226 million, or 2%, to $14.9 billion.\n- Diluted EPS increased 2% to $6.02 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the G illette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring charges, increased 12% to $6.59.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was $19.8 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital ex penditures and certain other impacts, was $16.9 billion.\n-    Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the G illette intangible asset impairment charge and a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105%.",

      "answer": "PG's Grooming segment reported 5% organic sales growth in fiscal 2022. However, by the end of fiscal 2022, the Grooming segment's net assets stood at $12,571 million, which is lower than the net assets of other larger segments such as Beauty ($13,296 million) and Health Care ($7,589 million), indicating a relatively smaller investment base despite positive growth. This suggests that PG may be allocating fewer resources to the Grooming segment compared to its other, larger business units.",

      "answer": "Fabric & Home Care's mid-single-digit organic sales growth contributed to P&G's total 2% net sales growth, as noted in the segment performance. According to the detailed breakdown, Fabric & Home Care achieved 1% volume growth, 3% pricing, and 1% mix, resulting in 4% net sales growth for the segment. This segment-level performance fed into the overall net sales increase of 2%, which was driven by 4% higher pricing across the company but partially offset by a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Volume and mix were unchanged at the company level, indicating that the segment's volume growth was neutralized elsewhere, and the overall growth was primarily price-driven despite FX headwinds.",

      "answer": "Philip Morris highlights on page 13 that cigarette tax regimes based on sales price place them at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets due to their premium-price brand portfolio. This concern is compounded on page 14, where it is stated that tax increases are expected to have an adverse impact on cigarette sales due to lower consumption levels and a shift from premium-price to mid- or low-price categories. The decline in cigarette sales volumes, also noted on page 14, could materially affect the company's revenue and profitability, which in turn threatens its ability to fund the smoke-free transformation. Thus, the interplay between tax policy, sales performance, and strategic transformation reveals a significant financial and operational risk.",

      "answer": "MDLZ experienced a $118 million increase in operating income due to favorable currency changes, primarily from the strength of the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar. At the same time, the company's Total Level 3 Investments were positively impacted by $52 million due to currency movements, as disclosed in the fair value measurement table. This shows that MDLZ's financial position is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations both at the operating income level and on its investment portfolio, where gains in one area (operating income) may coincide with parallel valuation effects on assets like Level 3 investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring 2021, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input costs. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for inhome consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.\n\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\nFavorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.",

      "answer": "The net loss from post-employment benefits in the comprehensive earnings section is reported as $85 million being amortized into earnings (page 124), which contributes to the total amortization amount of $266 million. This aligns with the $605 million of losses to be amortized related to post-employment benefits mentioned on page 123, which is part of the broader $2,589 million total losses to be amortized across all benefit categories. The $46 million in 'Net (losses) gains' under 'Other movements during the year' on page 124 further reflects ongoing adjustments to the post-employment benefits liability, contributing to the overall post-employment benefits movement of $101 million in total other comprehensive earnings. This shows how the initial loss recognition on page 123 flows through to earnings via amortization and other adjustments as detailed on page 124.",

      "answer": "The Beauty segment's net sales grew by only 1% in fiscal 2023, driven by 4% pricing gains but offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange and a 1% drag from mix effects (page 22 and 23). Despite this modest top-line growth, the segment's net assets increased from $13.296 billion at the end of fiscal 2022 to $13.888 billion at the end of fiscal 2023 (page 49). This asset growth reflects both acquisitions/divestitures ($405 million addition) and positive translation and other adjustments ($187 million), indicating that external factors and strategic moves contributed more to balance sheet growth than operating performance. This suggests that while the segment's core sales performance was constrained by mix and foreign exchange headwinds, asset growth was supported by external financial adjustments and M&A activity.",

      "question": "Why does Target's reported operating income of $5.6 billion differ from both its EBIT of $5.7 billion and the $5.3 billion earnings before income taxes figure, and what does this reveal about its financial reporting methodology?",
      "answer": "Target's reported operating income of $5.566 billion (rounded to $5.6 billion) on page 69 excludes certain interest expenses and tax-related adjustments. The EBIT figure of $5.672 billion (rounded to $5.7 billion) on page 31 adds back net interest expense of $411 million to operating income, reflecting earnings before interest and taxes. However, the earnings before income taxes figure of $5.3 billion on page 60 further adjusts this calculation, likely accounting for additional non-operating or extraordinary items not included in standard EBIT calculations. This reveals that while operating income focuses on core operational performance, EBIT incorporates financing decisions, and earnings before income taxes may reflect additional adjustments such as foreign tax considerations or one-time events, highlighting the importance of understanding which metrics include what adjustments when analyzing financial health.",

      "answer": "The finished product operations segment generates higher net operating revenues but operates with lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate operations. This means that while it contributes significantly to top-line growth, it has less room for absorbing cost increases. The company acknowledges that supply chain risks\u2014such as potential shortages and higher prices for HFCS due to weather or agricultural disease (e.g., citrus greening)\u2014could negatively impact net operating revenues. Additionally, the company notes that it may not be able to fully offset rising input costs through price increases, as consumer sensitivity to pricing could reduce sales volume. Therefore, any sustained increase in raw material costs could disproportionately affect the profitability of the finished product operations due to its lower margin structure and limited pricing flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "The Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nThe Company's operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating structure includes the following operating segments:\n\n- Europe, Middle East and Africa\n- Latin America\n- North America\n- Asia Pacific\n- Global Ventures\n- Bottling Investments\n\nOur operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives; and (2) a platform services organization supporting the operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs.\n\nFor additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this report.\n\nExcept to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a consolidated basis.\n\n## Products and Brands\n\nAs used in this report:\n\n- 'concentrates' means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used to prepare syrups or finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals for purified water products;\n- 'syrups' means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining concentrates with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive);\n- 'fountain syrups' means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;\n- 'Company Trademark Beverages' means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages bearing trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit; and\n- 'Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages' or 'Trademark Coca-Cola' means beverages bearing the trademark Coca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, etc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word 'Trademark' together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as 'Trademark Fanta,' 'Trademark Sprite' or 'Trademark Simply'), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions (such that 'Trademark Fanta' includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; 'Trademark Sprite' includes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and 'Trademark Simply' includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\n\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\n\n- beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as 'beverage bases,' and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our 'concentrate operations'); and\n- finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our 'finished product operations').\n\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.",

          "chunk_text": "areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The citrus industry is impacted by the variability of weather conditions and by greening disease, which affect the supply and quality of orange juice and orange juice concentrate, which are important raw materials for our business. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.\n\nAn increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials, aluminum cans and other containers that may be caused by changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; supplier quality and reliability issues; trade disruptions; changes in supply chain; and increases in tariffs; or events such as natural disasters, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like could negatively impact our net operating revenues and profits.\n\n## We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on various costs, such as our costs for materials and labor, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we are dependent upon, among other things, raw materials, packaging materials, plant labor and transportation providers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, geopolitical developments, demand for raw materials, weather, growing and harvesting conditions, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. We expect the inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2022.\n\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company's operating and internal control structures, including extending our Company's internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved with overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of key portions of our operations. These third-party service providers and business",

      "question": "How does Procter & Gamble's reported 1% Net Sales Growth in the Beauty segment for 2024 reconcile with the segment's $13,723 million net balance at year-end, especially considering that the segment showed 3% Organic Sales Growth driven primarily by pricing strategies?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's Beauty segment reported a modest 1% Net Sales Growth for 2024, which reflects the combined impact of a 2% positive foreign exchange effect and a 3% Organic Sales Growth driven by pricing strategies. Despite this, the segment's net balance at year-end stood at $13,723 million, indicating that while the top-line growth was limited, the segment maintained a significant asset base and revenue-generating capacity. This suggests that although pricing actions contributed to growth, external factors such as market demand elasticity or competitive pressures may have constrained overall sales expansion, even as the company preserved its long-term investment and operational footprint in the Beauty category.",

      "question": "How does Altria's long-term debt interest rate of 4.0% at the end of 2021 relate to its consistent use of a 4.0% rate of compensation increase in pension disclosures, and what does this suggest about its financial assumptions and risk management alignment?",
      "answer": "Altria's weighted-average coupon interest rate on long-term debt was 4.0% at the end of 2021, reflecting its cost of capital for debt obligations. In its pension disclosures, Altria also uses a 4.0% rate of compensation increase for long-term assumptions, a metric that has remained unchanged from 2019 to 2021. This alignment between the company\u2019s actual debt cost and its long-term compensation growth assumption suggests a conservative and consistent financial modeling approach, where future pension liabilities are projected using a rate that matches the company\u2019s real borrowing costs. This may indicate an effort to closely align actuarial assumptions with current financial realities to manage risk and ensure more accurate liability projections.",

Altria monitors the credit quality of its bank group and is not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider in that group. For further discussion on short-term borrowings, see Note 8.\n\nAny commercial paper issued by Altria and borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PM USA. For further discussion, see Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information below and Note 9.\n\nDebt - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria's total debt was $28.0 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively.\n\nIn May 2021, Altria repaid in full its 4.75% senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion at maturity.\n\nIn February 2021, Altria issued long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion (the 'Notes'). The net proceeds from the Notes were used (i) to fund the purchase and redemption of certain unsecured notes and payment of related fees and expenses (as described below) and (ii) for other general corporate purposes.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, Altria (i) completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,042 million and (ii) redeemed all of its outstanding 3.490% Notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt of $649 million, which included premiums and fees of $623 million and the write-off of related unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $26 million. As a result of the debt transactions, Altria reduced its near-term maturity towers, extended the weighted-average maturity of its debt and lowered its weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt.\n\nAll of Altria's long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was fixed-rate debt. The weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt was approximately 4.0% and 4.1% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nFor further details on long-term debt, see Note 9.",

Altria monitors the credit quality of its bank group and is not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider in that group. For further discussion on short-term borrowings, see Note 8.\n\nAny commercial paper issued by Altria and borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by PM USA. For further discussion, see Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information below and Note 9.\n\nDebt - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria's total debt was $28.0 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively.\n\nIn May 2021, Altria repaid in full its 4.75% senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion at maturity.\n\nIn February 2021, Altria issued long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion (the 'Notes'). The net proceeds from the Notes were used (i) to fund the purchase and redemption of certain unsecured notes and payment of related fees and expenses (as described below) and (ii) for other general corporate purposes.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, Altria (i) completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its long-term senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,042 million and (ii) redeemed all of its outstanding 3.490% Notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax losses on early extinguishment of debt of $649 million, which included premiums and fees of $623 million and the write-off of related unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $26 million. As a result of the debt transactions, Altria reduced its near-term maturity towers, extended the weighted-average maturity of its debt and lowered its weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt.\n\nAll of Altria's long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was fixed-rate debt. The weighted-average coupon interest rate on total long-term debt was approximately 4.0% and 4.1% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nFor further details on long-term debt, see Note 9.",

      "answer": "In 2020, acquisitions and divestments contributed 2.0% to the net sales growth of the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment, indicating a strategic emphasis on M&A as a lever for growth. During the same year, the company invested $274 million in direct capital expenditures for the same segment, suggesting a complementary approach that combines both strategic transactions and organic investment to drive growth. The M&A activity accounted for a meaningful portion of the 3.0% total net sales growth reported for the segment, while capital investments likely supported infrastructure and capabilities to sustain long-term performance.",

Meanwhile, PBNA's net acquisition-related investments for the year totaled $11 million, linked to strategic moves such as the Juice Transaction and Rockstar acquisition.

      "question": "Given QFNA's minimal contribution to PEP's operating profit, how does its allocation of employee protection costs reflect the company's cost distribution strategy across low-performing segments?",
      "answer": "QFNA contributed only 1% to PEP's total operating profit in 2021, indicating it is a low-performing segment. Despite this, the segment was allocated $1 million in employee protection costs, which represents a small but non-trivial portion of the company's total $70 million in such costs. This allocation pattern suggests that PEP distributes employee-related expenses based on operational requirements or regulatory obligations rather than segment profitability. When compared to higher-performing segments like FLNA, which absorbed $27 million in employee protection costs, the allocation appears proportionally aligned with operational scale, highlighting a cost distribution strategy that factors in segment size and compliance needs rather than financial performance alone.",

        "Hop 1: [PEP](page_72) \u2192 [QFNA]: QFNA contributes only 1% to PEP's operating profit, identifying it as a low-performing segment.",

        "Hop 3: [Employee Protection Costs] \u2190 [PEP](page_74): Employee protection costs are disclosed in aggregate ($70 million total), with QFNA's $1 million allocation being a small portion of this expense."

      "answer": "In 2024, AMESA's capital spending of $450 million significantly exceeds its depreciation and amortization expenses of $172 million, suggesting the segment is actively expanding or modernizing its asset base rather than simply maintaining existing assets. This contrasts with segments like Europe, where capital spending of $568 million is closer to its $377 million in depreciation and amortization, indicating a more mature asset base. The substantial gap in AMESA's figures implies a growth-oriented capital investment strategy, as the segment is investing more than what is required to replace depreciating assets, which aligns with management's plan to allocate $111 million in capital to AMESA through 2024.",

      "question": "The Argentine peso contributed to an 11% decrease in operating income but only a 5% decline in net operating revenues. What does this discrepancy suggest about KO's foreign exchange hedging effectiveness?",
      "answer": "The difference between the 11% unfavorable impact on operating income and the 5% decline in net operating revenues suggests that KO's foreign exchange hedging program partially offset the losses from currency fluctuations. Specifically, the hedging activities reduced the full negative impact of currencies like the Argentine peso on operating income compared to revenues. This is supported by the disclosure that the total impact of foreign exchange on operating income, including hedging, was a decrease of 11%, while the impact on net operating revenues was a 5% decrease. This indicates that KO\u2019s hedging strategy was effective in mitigating some of the earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange movements, particularly in markets like Argentina.",

The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures.

The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 11% and 8% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Other Income (Loss) - Net' above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million and $312 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2024, we generated $28.7 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $18,442 million and $17,505 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $366 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $511 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $62 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $325 million decrease in fair value.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to ex isting and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix  of fix ed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.",

      "answer": "Walmart emphasizes ROI over ROA because ROI adjusts operating income by excluding depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash or non-operational items, while also refining the denominator by using invested capital instead of total assets. This approach better reflects how Walmart is deploying its key assets, especially as ROA remained flat at 5.6% for both fiscal years despite rising operating income. The increase in ROI from 14.0% to 14.9% suggests that these adjustments more accurately capture the impact of strategic asset deployment, even though GAAP-based ROA did not change.",

We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\n\n## Return on Assets and Return on Investment\n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. ROI was 14.9% and 14.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which increased primarily due to the increase in operating income.\n\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.\n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain",

      "answer": "Sam's Club U.S. owns 513 of its 600 retail units (85.5%) compared to Walmart U.S., which owns only 4,039 of its 4,605 total units (87.7% owned). This high property ownership for Sam's Club U.S. may require more capital commitment to real estate, potentially limiting flexibility for digital investments compared to Walmart U.S., which leases a larger portion of its units and may have more capital available for omnichannel initiatives.

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites and mobile applications, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club U.S. segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omnichannel initiatives.

      "answer": "Pet Nutrition achieved 14% GAAP net sales growth in 2020 with minimal foreign exchange headwinds (only 0.5% negative impact), indicating strong organic performance. Despite this growth, the segment reported only $62 million in depreciation and amortization expense for 2020, significantly lower than other segments like North America (Oral, Personal and Home Care: $104 million).

This contrasts sharply with PBNA, which contributed $238 million in 2024 expenses and is expected to bear 25% of pre-tax charges, and Europe, which also has a 25% expected pre-tax charge allocation despite contributing $123 million in 2024 expenses.

However, on page 26, the net sales growth for Grooming is reported at 2%, which factors in a negative 3% impact from foreign exchange. This discrepancy is explained by the significant effect of currency fluctuations, which offset the strong pricing contribution of 5% in the Grooming segment. Thus, while the underlying business performance (organic growth) is strong, the reported net sales growth is reduced due to external macroeconomic factors beyond the company's control.",

      "answer": "MDLZ excludes acquisition integration costs from segment operating income to provide transparency into core segment performance, but this exclusion means that the $6 million in integration costs related to the Grenade acquisition (reported on page 98) are not reflected in the $317 million year-over-year increase in segment operating income (disclosed on page 134). While the Grenade acquisition added $63 million in incremental net revenues in 2021, the integration costs\u2014though relatively small\u2014represent a real expense that affects overall profitability. By separating these costs from segment results, MDLZ allows investors to focus on ongoing operational performance, but it also means that the true economic impact of the acquisition on profitability is less immediately visible in the segment reporting framework.",

Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the Turkish lira and Russian ruble. Favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, cheese &amp; grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The March 25, 2021 acquisition of Grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.\n\nSegment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower Simplify to Grow Program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $235 million (2.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.8 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.3 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix due to overall higher volume was tempered by the net impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, as overall increased food purchases for in-home consumption were partially offset by a negative volume impact on our world travel retail and foodservice businesses due to lockdowns and other restrictions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, cheese &amp; grocery, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and gum. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits and chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in cheese &amp; grocery, candy, gum and refreshment beverages. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Norwegian krone and Ukrainian hryvnia, mostly offset by the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, British pound sterling, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\n\nSegment operating income increased $43 million (2.5%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

The fair value measurements of intangible assets are based on significant unobservable inputs, and thus represent Level 3 inputs. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair values of intangible assets include discounted future cash flows, customer attrition rates and discount rates. Through the oneyear anniversary of the acquisition, Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and operating income of $6 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $15 million in 2020. We incurred acquisition integration costs of $6 million in 2021 and $2 million in 2020.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in a U.S. refrigerated nutrition bar company, Perfect Snacks, within our North America segment for $284 million cash paid, net of cash received, and expanded our position in broader snacking. During the first quarter of 2020, we finalized the purchase price allocation of $31 million to definite-life intangible assets, $107 million to indefinite-life intangible assets, $150 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant and equipment, $12 million to inventory, $8 million to accounts receivable, $13 million to current liabilities, $3 million to deferred tax liabilities and $9 million to other liabilities. Through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, Perfect Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million and an immaterial amount of incremental operating income in 2020.\n\nOn May 28, 2019, we completed the sale of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa to Arla Foods of Denmark. In 2019, we received cash proceeds of $161 million and divested $19 million of current assets and $96 million of non-current assets. During 2019, we recorded a net pre-tax gain of $44 million on the sale. The divestiture resulted in year-over-year declines in net revenues of $55 million and operating income of $9 million during 2020.

      "answer": "The AMESA segment's depreciation and other amortization expenses increased from $116 million in 2019 to $181 million in 2021, a $65 million rise over two years. This increase coincides with the acquisition of Pioneer Foods in 2020, which was valued at $173 million. The timing and magnitude of the expense increase suggest that the acquisition introduced significant depreciable and amortizable assets into the AMESA segment. Given that the filing separately discloses 'Amortization of Intangible Assets' and 'Depreciation and Other Amortization,' it is likely that the Pioneer Foods acquisition included both intangible assets (such as brand value or customer relationships) and tangible assets (like property, plant, and equipment) that are now being systematically amortized and depreciated, respectively.",

      "answer": "In 2020, Colgate's Pet Nutrition segment achieved 14.0% GAAP net sales growth, significantly outperforming the Europe region's 12.0% growth within Oral, Personal and Home Care. However, capital investment as measured by depreciation and amortization expenses was much lower for Pet Nutrition ($62M) compared to Europe ($98M). This suggests Colgate maintained a more capital-efficient approach in its fastest-growing segment while allocating more resources to the Europe region, which had a higher capital intensity relative to its growth rate.",

      "answer": "In Germany, unfavorable cigarette mix contributed to a partial offset of higher heated tobacco unit volume and favorable device mix, with net revenues increasing by 8.8%, driven by favorable pricing and volume/mix dynamics. In contrast, in Russia and Ukraine, unfavorable cigarette mix was a more pronounced drag, contributing to a 5.9% net revenue increase despite favorable pricing and heated tobacco unit volume. This reveals that Germany's combustible product portfolio maintains stronger pricing power and mix resilience compared to Russia and Ukraine, where cigarette mix had a more negative impact on profitability despite similar regional dynamics in heated tobacco growth.",

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

On page 47, the company attributes part of the favorable price, product, and geographic mix to improved channel and package mix across several regions, including Latin America and North America. This favorable channel and package mix is explicitly cited on page 48 as a primary contributor to the gross profit margin increase from 58.1% in 2022 to 59.5% in 2023. Therefore, the improvement in gross profit margin is partially explained by the same channel and package mix dynamics that positively influenced net operating revenues, revealing a strategic alignment in how product and channel optimization is driving both top-line and pre-expense profitability growth.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's risk factors highlight ongoing challenges related to commodity price volatility, supply chain constraints, and cost pressures that could adversely affect profitability and net revenues. Despite these risks, the company reported a $107 million contribution from favorable volume/mix improvements in the operating income reconciliation. This suggests that volume gains, particularly in categories like chocolate, biscuits, gum, and candy, helped offset some of the negative impacts from rising input costs. The alignment indicates that while MDLZ faces real cost pressures from supply chain and commodity risks, its strategic focus on product mix and volume growth contributed positively to operating income, supporting its ability to manage through these challenges without fully passing on increased costs to consumers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndeforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. Thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation, such as we experienced across our business, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, primarily in the second half of 2021, may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products, or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives, and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.\n\nWith respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws. Equity investments such as our investments in JDE Peet's N.V. and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.\n\nFurthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $725 million (12.6%), due to favorable volume/mix (5.3 pp), favorable currency (3.8 pp), higher net pricing (2.0 pp), the impact of an acquisition (0.9 pp) and the partial year contribution of a business divested on November 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected net overall volume gains as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across most of the region, though some markets were still challenged. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment beverages. Favorable currency impacts were due to the strength of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, South African rand and New Zealand dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. The April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis) in 2021. The packaged seafood business, which was part of our April 1, 2021 acquisition of Gourmet Food but divested on November 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture.\n\nSegment operating income increased $233 million (28.4%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, favorable currency, the impact of an acquisition, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges and the partial year contribution of a business divested which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues decreased $30 million (0.5%), due to unfavorable currency (1.3 pp), the impact of a divestiture (0.9 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Indian rupee, South African rand, Australian dollar and Pakistan rupee, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Philippine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to unfavorable product mix as overall higher volume was tempered by the negative volume impact from COVID-19 related lockdowns impacting our traditional trade markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in gum, chocolate, candy and refreshment beverages, partially offset by gains in biscuits and cheese &amp; grocery. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, biscuits, refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in candy and gum.\n\nSegment operating income increased $130 million (18.8%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lapping prior-year expenses from the resolution of tax matters in India totaling $87 million, lower manufacturing costs (net of incremental COVID-19 related costs), lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and the impact of the prior-year divestiture.",

      "question": "How does the unfavorable pricing variance in Indonesia for combustible products, as noted in the revenue analysis, reconcile with the reclassification of derivative gains into net revenues in 2022, and what does this imply about PM's revenue management strategy?",
      "answer": "The unfavorable pricing variance in Indonesia for combustible products contributed to a 2.3% decrease in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, as noted on page 57. However, on page 110, PM reported a reclassification of $59 million in derivative gains into net revenues for 2021, which partially offset revenue declines. This implies that PM utilized financial hedging strategies to mitigate some of the negative impacts from pricing pressures in key markets like Indonesia, thereby managing overall revenue performance.",
