      "answer": "The $132 million in acquisition-related integration costs included in the Corporate/Other segment's adjusted operating income on page 118 reflects the segment-level impact of integration activities, which are also aggregated into the consolidated view on page 185 where total acquisition-related integration costs declined from $332 million in 2020 to $132 million in 2021. This shows that while acquisition-related costs are decreasing overall, they still represent a material adjustment to operating income at both the segment and consolidated levels, indicating ongoing integration efforts post-acquisition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "question": "How does Merck's disclosure of the Animal Health segment's vulnerability to disease outbreaks and product-specific risks, such as Bravecto, reconcile with the relatively stable segment profits of $1.938 billion in 2024 despite these exposures?",
      "answer": "Merck's Animal Health segment faces significant risks from disease outbreaks and product-specific vulnerabilities like Bravecto, which accounted for 19% of the segment's sales in 2024. Despite these risks, the segment reported stable profits of $1.938 billion in 2024, suggesting strong underlying performance and diversification across products and markets. The segment profit metric, which includes cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and R&D costs directly incurred by the segment, indicates that Merck has managed these risks effectively through operational controls and strategic resource allocation. This alignment suggests that while the segment is exposed to material risks, its profitability remains resilient, likely due to robust product demand, cost management, and risk mitigation strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

However, in terms of sales, the Medical Devices segment accounted for only 9.5% of JNJ's total sales in 2020.

However, the identifiable assets for the same segment remained relatively flat, decreasing slightly from $58,436 million in 2022 to $58,324 million in 2023.

      "question": "How does the expected strength in Front Store sales referenced in the Retail/LTC segment's 2022 outlook reconcile with the risk that reduced customer traffic due to ongoing COVID-19 policies could negatively impact Front Store sales?",
      "answer": "The Retail/LTC segment's 2022 outlook (page 134) includes expectations of continued strength in Front Store sales, particularly from OTC test kits, despite pharmacy reimbursement pressure and minimum wage-related operating expenses. This positive outlook is based on the assumption that demand for pandemic-related products will persist at a reduced level compared to 2021. However, the risk factors section (page 40) highlights that government policies aimed at reducing the transmission of COVID-19, including mask mandates and social distancing, could reduce customer traffic in retail pharmacies and thereby negatively impact Front Store sales. The contradiction between these perspectives suggests that while the company anticipates sustained consumer demand for certain products like OTC test kits, external regulatory and public health measures remain a material risk that could undermine this expectation, especially if new variants emerge or vaccine hesitancy persists.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

The impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be material and adverse.\n\nCOVID-19 has spread to every state in the U.S., has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to severely impact, the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world.\n\nThe legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently, including the Families First Act, the CARES Act, the American Rescue Plan Act and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our Health Care Benefits Insured products. As a result of COVID-19, including legislative and/or regulatory responses to COVID-19, the premiums we charge in our Insured Health Care Benefits products may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical services delivered to our Insured medical members, which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs.\n\nFederal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including existing and new variants, such as mask and vaccination mandates, restrictions on large gatherings and social distancing directives, may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and have resulted in, among other things, a reduction in utilization that is discretionary, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, reduced customer traffic and front store sales in our retail pharmacies, our customers being ordered to close or severely curtail their operations, the adoption of work-from-home policies and a reduction in diagnostic reporting due to reductions in health care provider visits and restrictions on our access to providers' medical records, all of which impact our businesses. Among other impacts of these policies and initiatives on our businesses, there may be changes in medical claims submission patterns and an adverse impact on (i) drug utilization due to the reduction in discretionary visits with providers; (ii) front store sales as a result of reduced customer traffic in our retail pharmacies; (iii) medical membership in our Health Care Benefits segment and covered lives in our PBM clients due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers (including due to business failures) as well as reduced willingness to change benefits providers by prospective customers; (iv) benefit costs due to COVID-19 related support programs we have put in place for our medical members and mandated increases to the medical services we must pay for without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our Insured Health Care Benefits products; and (v) the amount, timing and collectability of payments to the Company from customers, clients, government payers and members as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on them. Over time, these policies and initiatives also may cause us to experience increased benefit costs and/or decreased revenues in our Health Care Benefits segment if, as a result of our medical members not seeing their providers as a result of COVID-19, we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage benefit costs and chronic conditions of our medical members and appropriately document their risk profiles.\n\nIn addition, in response to COVID-19, during the first half of 2020, we began to offer our medical members expanded benefit coverage and became obligated by governmental action to provide other additional coverage. This expanded benefit coverage continued to be provided without a corresponding increase in the premiums we receive in our Insured Health Care Benefits",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2021, JNJ reported $53,372 million in identifiable assets allocated to the Medical Devices segment, while research and development (R&D) spending for the same segment was $2,377 million, representing 8.8% of sales. This suggests that while the Medical Devices segment is capital-intensive with significant asset allocation, its R&D investment relative to sales is modest compared to the Pharmaceutical segment, which spent 22.8% of sales on R&D. This could indicate a more mature, asset-heavy business with less emphasis on innovation-driven growth within the Medical Devices segment.",

However, despite this growth, JNJ initiated a restructuring program within the MedTech segment, particularly in the Orthopaedics franchise, incurring $319 million in pre-tax restructuring expenses in 2023 alone. This suggests that while the MedTech segment is performing well in terms of revenue generation, especially in the U.S. market, JNJ is also taking proactive steps to streamline operations, exit certain markets and product lines, and optimize cost structures. The restructuring is expected to cost between $700 million and $800 million and be completed by the end of fiscal year 2025, indicating a strategic balance between capitalizing on growth and managing long-term operational efficiency.",

      "question": "How does JNJ's expected return on plan assets for its retirement plans in 2023 compare to the net periodic benefit cost, and what does this imply about the financial health and sustainability of the plans given JNJ's sponsorship and actuarial assumptions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an expected return on plan assets of $2,716 million for its retirement plans, while the net periodic benefit cost was a credit of $676 million. This indicates that the returns generated from plan assets were sufficient to offset most of the pension expenses for the year. However, the net credit contrasts with the significant service cost of $893 million and interest cost of $1,437 million, suggesting that without the expected return, the plans would have been a net expense. Given that JNJ sponsors these plans and relies on actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and expected returns, the financial health of the plans depends heavily on the accuracy of these assumptions and the performance of the underlying assets. This dynamic underscores the importance of asset-liability management and the potential risk to JNJ if future returns fall short of expectations.",

      "question": "How does Merck's risk disclosure around disease outbreaks in the Animal Health segment reconcile with the segment's 4.5% year-over-year increase in sales from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "Merck's risk disclosure on page 37 highlights that disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza or African Swine Fever could materially impact the Animal Health segment by reducing demand for products and disrupting manufacturing. Despite these risks, the Animal Health segment reported sales growth from $5.625 billion in 2023 to $5.877 billion in 2024, representing a 4.5% increase. This growth, detailed in the financial tables on page 131, was partially driven by strong performance of products like Bravecto, which accounted for 19% of segment sales. The segment's ability to grow sales despite identified risks suggests effective risk mitigation strategies and continued demand for key products, even in the face of potential disease-related disruptions.",

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "answer": "The Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division oversees the Primary Care segment, which includes vaccines and treatments such as Comirnaty and Paxlovid. In 2024, revenues for Comirnaty dropped significantly from $37,809 million in 2022 to $5,353 million, while Paxlovid revenue also declined from $18,933 million to $5,716 million. These drops likely reflect reduced demand for pandemic-related products. Despite this, the U.S. Commercial Division maintained a dedicated structure for Primary Care, including internal medicine, migraine, and vaccine portfolios, suggesting a continued strategic emphasis on these therapeutic areas.

      "question": "Given the Consumer Health segment's $2,061 million pre-tax income in 2019 and the subsequent 2021 decision to spin off this segment, how does Johnson & Johnson's financial performance in this business line align with the strategic rationale for its separation?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's Consumer Health segment generated $2,061 million in pre-tax income in 2019, indicating a historically profitable business line. However, the company announced in November 2021 its intention to spin off the Consumer Health segment, signaling a strategic shift away from this business to focus on higher-growth areas like Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. This decision suggests that despite the segment's profitability, J&J viewed it as less aligned with its long-term innovation-driven strategy. The spin-off likely aims to unlock shareholder value and allow the newly independent Consumer Health company to operate more nimbly in a competitive, consumer-facing market.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

      "question": "How does the $1.2 billion increase in Adjusted Operating Income in the Pharmacy Services segment reconcile with the $1,471 million loss reported in the Corporate/Other segment, especially considering the strategic role of the Corporate/Other segment in supporting the broader health care model described in the notes to financial statements?",
      "answer": "The $1.2 billion increase in Adjusted Operating Income in the Pharmacy Services segment reflects strong performance driven by improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy services. However, this is contrasted by the $1,471 million loss in the Corporate/Other segment, which includes costs related to strategic initiatives, integration, and corporate-level support functions. The notes to financial statements indicate that Corporate/Other plays a critical role in enabling the broader health care model by facilitating integration across segments, managing acquisitions, and supporting innovation. Therefore, while the Pharmacy Services segment delivers strong operational performance, the Corporate/Other segment absorbs significant strategic and transitional costs that are essential to sustaining and enhancing the Company\u2019s integrated health care delivery model over the long term.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "answer": "The Health Services segment experienced a 44% increase in its total balance from $23,615 million in 2022 to $34,066 million in 2023, primarily driven by acquisitions. This growth positively contributed to the segment\u2019s Adjusted Operating Income, which rose to $7,312 million in 2023. However, despite this segmental improvement, the overall Adjusted Operating Income for CVS declined slightly from $18,037 million in 2022 to $17,534 million in 2023, indicating that challenges in other segments or corporate-level costs offset the gains from Health Services.

      "question": "How does the decline in Specialty Diagnostics' revenue from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023 relate to the increase in its depreciation expense from $75 million to $86 million, and what does this imply about TMO's capital investment strategy for this segment?",
      "answer": "The Specialty Diagnostics segment experienced a revenue decline from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023, as disclosed on page 21. Despite this drop, the segment's depreciation expense rose from $75 million to $86 million, as detailed in the consolidated depreciation table on page 50. This increase in depreciation suggests that TMO continued to invest in capital assets for Specialty Diagnostics during a period of declining revenues. This could indicate a strategic decision to modernize or expand the segment's asset base in anticipation of future growth, even amid current financial headwinds. The combination of declining revenue and rising depreciation implies a deliberate capital investment strategy aimed at long-term positioning rather than short-term profitability.",

      "question": "How does the growth in CVS's Health Services segment balance from 2022 to 2023 relate to the Adjusted Operating Income performance, and what does this imply about the profitability trajectory of this segment relative to the company's overall adjusted earnings?",
      "answer": "CVS's Health Services segment balance grew from $23,615 million in 2022 to $34,066 million in 2023, reflecting significant expansion through acquisitions and realignment. This growth coincided with an Adjusted Operating Income of $6,781 million for Health Services in 2022, which was slightly lower than the prior year adjusted figure of $7,356 million. However, the overall Adjusted Operating Income for CVS in 2023 was $17,534 million, down from $18,037 million in 2022. Despite the segment's strong balance sheet growth, its Adjusted Operating Income declined, suggesting that the integration of acquisitions and expansion may not have immediately translated into proportional profitability gains. This implies a short-term drag on segment-level profitability despite long-term strategic growth.",

      "question": "Given UnitedHealthcare's revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023, how does the decline in its operating margin contrast with the overall stability in the company's consolidated operating margin, and what might this indicate about performance pressures within UNH's broader segment portfolio?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealthcare saw its revenues increase by $16,848 million (6%) in 2024 compared to 2023, rising from $281,360 million to $298,208 million. However, its operating margin declined from 5.8% to 5.2%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points, indicating margin compression despite top-line growth. In contrast, UNH's consolidated operating margin, which reflects the performance of the entire company including Optum and intersegment eliminations, remained relatively stable, decreasing only slightly from 8.7% in 2023 to 8.1% in 2024. This suggests that while UnitedHealthcare faced specific cost or pricing pressures that eroded its profitability, other segments\u2014particularly Optum Health and Optum Rx, which saw operating margin improvements\u2014helped stabilize the company's overall profitability. The divergence implies that UnitedHealthcare may be experiencing operational or market-specific challenges, such as increased medical cost trends or competitive pricing, which are being offset by stronger performance in other business areas.",

      "question": "Given the growth in revenues from Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services, how does the increase in consolidated depreciation in 2023 reflect the capital intensity of supporting this business segment compared to prior years?",
      "answer": "The Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment reported revenues of $23,041 million in 2023, up from $22,511 million in 2022, indicating growth in this business area. This growth appears to have required increased capital investment, as evidenced by the rise in depreciation specific to this segment from $614 million in 2022 to $669 million in 2023. This increase in segment-level depreciation directly contributed to the overall rise in consolidated depreciation, which grew from $986 million in 2022 to $1,068 million in 2023. The upward trend in depreciation suggests that TMO has been investing in fixed assets to support the operations and expansion of the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, making this segment more capital-intensive over time.",

      "answer": "The 20.6% increase in Adjusted Operating Income ($1.2 billion) in the Pharmacy Services segment in 2021 indicates strong performance in core PBM and specialty pharmacy operations. However, this positive trend contrasts with the $1,471 million loss reported in the Corporate & Other segment, which includes unallocated corporate expenses and strategic initiatives not tied directly to operating segments. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 118 clarify that the Corporate & Other segment reflects the company\u2019s broader strategic investments and administrative overhead, which may not directly contribute to segment-level profitability. Therefore, while the Pharmacy Services segment is delivering strong financial performance, the Corporate & Other segment\u2019s loss suggests that corporate-level investments or restructuring efforts are offsetting some of these gains, potentially in support of long-term strategic goals such as digital transformation, integration of acquisitions, or expansion into new health care services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "answer": "The Analytical Instruments segment experienced a revenue increase from $6,624 million in 2022 to $7,263 million in 2023, representing an 11.5% growth. Over the same period, its segment income rose from $1,507 million to $1,908 million, a 26.6% increase. This significant growth in segment income outpaces the overall consolidated operating income decline from $8,393 million in 2022 to $6,859 million in 2023.

      "question": "How does the inclusion of $6.2 billion in inventory write-offs within the Biopharma segment's earnings for 2023 reconcile with the broader impact of these write-offs on the company's overall cost of sales and profitability trends in 2024?",
      "answer": "The Biopharma segment's 2023 earnings included $6.2 billion in inventory write-offs and related charges due to lower-than-expected demand for Pfizer's COVID-19 products. These write-offs were specifically attributed to Paxlovid ($5.0 billion) and Comirnaty ($1.2 billion) and were recorded as part of the Cost of Sales. In 2024, the Cost of Sales decreased by $7.1 billion year-over-year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of this $6.2 billion non-cash charge, despite the inclusion of $1.9 billion related to the Seagen acquisition. This indicates that while the Biopharma segment absorbed the direct impact of these charges in 2023, the broader financial effect was seen across the company in the following year, influencing overall cost structure and profitability trends. The segment-level disclosure provides insight into the origin of the charges, while the consolidated cost of sales section highlights their downstream impact on financial performance.",

      "question": "How does the allocation of Office Real Estate Optimization Charges to the Health Care Benefits segment in 2023 impact the segment's adjusted operating income relative to its overall balance sheet growth during the year?",
      "answer": "The Office Real Estate Optimization Charges allocated to the Health Care Benefits segment in 2023 amounted to $49 million, which was part of the broader $46 million total charges disclosed in the GAAP to adjusted operating income reconciliation. This negatively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income of $5,577 million. However, despite these charges, the Health Care Benefits segment experienced significant balance sheet growth, increasing from $44,159 million to $46,644 million in total assets by the end of 2023, driven largely by acquisitions adding $2,594 million. This indicates that while restructuring activities had a measurable impact on short-term financial metrics, the segment's long-term asset base expanded substantially.",

      "answer": "Optum Health experienced significant revenue growth of $14.257 billion (36%) from 2020 to 2021, yet its operating margin decreased from 8.6% to 8.3% during the same period. This margin contraction occurred despite strong revenue growth, suggesting rising costs or expenses. The risk disclosures highlight that Optum Health depends on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other providers, and that disputes or financial instability among these providers could lead to increased costs or disruptions in service. While the evidence doesn't explicitly state that provider relationships caused the margin decline, the risk disclosures indicate that such relationships represent a material financial risk that could impact profitability, making the margin contraction potentially concerning from a risk exposure perspective.",

Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether innetwork or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management's attention from our operations and result in negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.\n\nSome providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in other cases the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us.\n\nThe success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers.\n\nIn addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

      "question": "How does Merck's revenue recognition framework for collaborative arrangements like the Eisai partnership differ from its revenue recognition approach for the Animal Health segment, and what implications does this have for interpreting segment profitability?",
      "answer": "Merck recognizes its share of profits from the Eisai collaboration as alliance revenue, calculated net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, and does not directly record Lenvima product sales since Eisai acts as the principal. In contrast, Merck acts as the principal in the Animal Health segment, recording revenue on a gross basis for product sales with a single performance obligation\u2014the transfer of goods. This difference in revenue recognition frameworks means that profitability metrics for the Animal Health segment reflect full revenue and cost of sales dynamics, while the Eisai collaboration\u2019s contribution to profitability is reported on a net basis, limiting comparability between the two business structures.",

Prior period Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segment profits have been recast to reflect this change on a comparable basis.\n\nPharmaceutical  segment  profits  grew  19%  in  2021  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  and  the  favorable  effect  of  foreign exchange, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs. Pharmaceutical segment profits increased 11% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales, as well as lower selling and promotional costs. Animal Health segment profits grew 17% in 2021 reflecting  higher  sales,  partially  offset  by  higher  promotional,  selling  and  administrative  costs. Animal  Health  segment  profits increased 4% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales and lower promotional and selling costs, partially offset by higher R&amp;D costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 11.0% in 2021, 22.9% in 2020 and 21.8% in 2019. The full  year  effective  income  tax  rate  reflects  a  favorable  mix  of  income  and  expense,  as  well  as  higher  foreign  tax  credits  from ordinary business operations that the Company was able to credit in 2021. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the beneficial impact of the settlement of a foreign tax matter, as well as a net tax benefit of $207 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the unfavorable effect of a charge for the acquisition of Pandion for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2020 reflects the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of VelosBio for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the favorable impact of a $106 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of Merck's Consumer Care (MCC)  business  due  to  the  lapse  in  the  statute  of  limitations.  In  addition,  the  effective  income  tax  rate  in  2019  reflects  the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and charges of $117 million related to the finalization of treasury regulations for the transition tax associated with the 2017 enactment of U.S. tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $13 million in 2021, $4 million in 2020 and $(84) million in 2019. The loss in 2019 was driven primarily by the portion of goodwill impairment charges related to certain businesses in the Healthcare Services segment that were attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company's performance that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the  nature  of  these  items  and  the  impact  that  they  have  on  the  analysis  of  underlying  business  performance  and  trends.  The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs,  income  and  losses  from  investments  in  equity  securities  and  certain  other  items.  These  excluded  items  are  significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP EPS. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP pretax income. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be  comparable  to  the  calculation  of  similar  measures  of  other  companies.  The  information  on  non-GAAP  income  and  nonGAAP  EPS  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  but  not  as  a  substitute  for  or  superior  to,  net  income  and  EPS  prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP).",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "answer": "CVS reported a $1.2 billion (20.6%) increase in Adjusted Operating Income for 2021, primarily due to improved purchasing economics and contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. However, this growth occurred alongside persistent Intersegment Eliminations, which totaled $711 million in 2021 and consistently reduced consolidated operating income across multiple years (e.g., $697 million in 2019). These eliminations reflect internal transactions between business segments that must be removed for consolidated reporting. The contradiction between strong segment-level performance and the recurring negative impact of internal eliminations suggests that intercompany activities may be substantial enough to influence overall profitability metrics, despite positive trends in core business drivers like purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "The cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges, which include interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, are explicitly stated to be included in the balance sheet under 'long-term obligations.' On page 97, the document notes that these adjustments are part of the fair value treatment for derivatives. On page 88, the long-term obligations section shows that euro-denominated notes, such as the 1.875% Senior Notes due in 2049 and the 2.00% Senior Notes due in 2051, have carrying values that reflect fair value hedge accounting adjustments. These adjustments, which totaled $25 million in 2020 and are now embedded in the $32,333 million long-term obligations as of 2022, reconcile the derivative-related fair value changes with the reported carrying values of specific debt instruments. This three-hop analysis reveals how derivative instruments directly impact the valuation of long-term euro-denominated debt liabilities on the balance sheet.",

As a result, despite the drag from growth investments, the operating profit margin increased by 980 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020.

In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 2.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020. On an overall basis, in 2021 the Life Sciences segment saw continued strong demand for products supporting customers in the pursuit and production of COVID-19-related vaccines and therapeutics as well as broad strength across its other product lines. In 2021, core sales for the filtration, separation and purification technologies business increased compared to 2020 due to strong demand for these products led by the biopharmaceutical and the microelectronics end-markets, partially offset by weaker demand in the aerospace end-market. Geographically, core sales for the business were led by North America, Western Europe and China. Core sales for the Company's flow cytometry, genomics, lab automation, centrifugation, particle counting and characterization business increased in 2021 across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. Core sales for the business were driven by demand earlier in the year for genomic sample preparation consumables related to COVID-19 as well as demand for flow cytometry products. Core sales in the mass spectrometry business increased in 2021 across all major endmarkets driven in part by demand for new products. Geographically, demand for these products increased across all major geographies, led by North America, Western Europe and China.\n\nThe acquisitions of Cytiva on March 31, 2020 (the 'Cytiva Acquisition') and Aldevron on August 30, 2021 have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's bioprocessing workflow and genomic medicine solutions. In 2021, Cytiva experienced significant increased year-overyear demand across all major geographies, driven by continued strong demand for instruments and consumables used in the research and development and production of COVID-19 related treatments and vaccines and increased demand for non-COVID 19 related products as well as by the completion of a major project in China. Since acquisition, Aldevron has seen sales growth in all major product lines compared to the prior year period.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins increased 980 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020.

This aligns with Optum being listed as a reportable segment, which indicates its strategic importance and the company's focus on tracking its financial performance independently.

      "answer": "The $6.2 billion inventory write-off in 2023, primarily driven by lower-than-expected demand for Comirnaty and Paxlovid, directly reduced the Biopharma segment's earnings, which reported $15,923 million in 2023.

      "question": "How does the negative impact of foreign exchange on Keytruda sales, as detailed in the operating results section, reconcile with its reported revenue growth of $29.482 billion in 2024, and what does this reveal about Merck's geographic pricing dynamics?",
      "answer": "The negative impact of foreign exchange, particularly the devaluation of the Argentine peso, reduced Keytruda sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points in 2024, as noted in the operating results section. Despite this, Keytruda still achieved a reported revenue of $29.482 billion, representing 18% global sales growth (22% excluding foreign exchange). This reveals that Merck's geographic pricing strategy, including inflation-adjusted price increases in markets like Argentina, helped offset currency headwinds. The difference between the reported growth and constant currency growth underscores the importance of foreign exchange volatility in shaping financial outcomes and highlights Merck's ability to maintain strong demand for Keytruda across both metastatic and earlier-stage cancer indications globally.",

The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

      "question": "How does Danaher's emphasis on core sales growth as a key performance indicator reconcile with the 170 basis point decline in operating profit margins, especially considering that higher core sales were cited as contributing 250 basis points of favorable impact on margins?",
      "answer": "Danaher's 2024 10-K highlights a 170 basis point decline in operating profit margins compared to 2023, with lower core sales being a key unfavorable factor (page 42). However, in another section, the company notes that higher core sales contributed 250 basis points of favorable impact on operating margins (page 44). This apparent contradiction is clarified by the definition provided on page 40, which explains that core sales growth is a non-GAAP metric that excludes currency translation, acquisitions, and divestitures, aiming to reflect underlying business trends. Therefore, while core sales growth is emphasized as a strategic performance indicator to highlight operational improvements, the GAAP-based operating margin decline reflects broader financial pressures, including reduced leverage on fixed costs due to lower overall sales volume. This distinction shows how non-GAAP metrics can present a more favorable narrative even when GAAP-based profitability is under pressure.",

However, the risk factors section highlights that Optum Health's profitability is highly sensitive to the accuracy of medical cost estimation, particularly under its value-based arrangements. If actual costs exceed forecasts\u2014due to factors like medical inflation, unexpected utilization, or inaccurate population risk assessment\u2014its ability to maintain or grow earnings could be materially impacted.

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "question": "How does the $307 million negative adjustment to operating income from the receipt of the fully reserved ACA Risk Corridor receivable align with the reported financial resilience of the Health Care Benefits segment, given its consistent asset base between 2020 and 2021?",
      "answer": "The $307 million negative adjustment to operating income from the receipt of the fully reserved ACA Risk Corridor receivable in 2020 reflects a one-time accounting impact that temporarily reduced reported operating income. However, this does not appear to have significantly affected the long-term financial health of the Health Care Benefits segment, as evidenced by its consistent asset base of $45.1 billion at both December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This suggests that while the adjustment created a short-term drag on GAAP operating income, the underlying segment maintained its financial stability and asset position, indicating resilience in its core operations.",

      "answer": "The Biotechnology segment experienced a significant drop in operating profit, declining from $3,008 million in 2022 to $1,909 million in 2023, despite maintaining a relatively stable level of intangible assets, which increased slightly from $22,087 million to $22,477 million over the same period. This decline in profitability occurred alongside a depreciation and amortization expense of $1,026 million for the segment in 2023, which is a key component of the company's overall operating cost structure. The modest growth in intangible assets, primarily driven by foreign currency translation and other adjustments of $388 million, suggests limited new investment activity, yet the segment still saw a notable reduction in operating profit. This indicates that the drop in profitability may be attributable to operating performance issues rather than asset base changes, especially considering the significant depreciation burden that persists even with flat intangible asset growth.",

      "question": "How does the change in pension benefit obligation between 2022 and 2023 reflect the differing impact of the discount rate changes reported in other comprehensive income, particularly considering the negative $67 million effect in 2023 versus the positive $870 million effect in 2022?",
      "answer": "The change in pension benefit obligation between 2022 and 2023 reflects the sensitivity of pension liabilities to discount rate changes. In 2022, the $870 million positive effect from the discount rate change in other comprehensive income suggests that discount rates increased, reducing the present value of pension obligations. In contrast, the $67 million negative effect in 2023 indicates that discount rates decreased, thereby increasing the present value of pension obligations. The reversal in sign and magnitude shows that the company's pension liability is inversely related to discount rate movements, with the 2023 decline in rates causing a larger upward adjustment in liabilities compared to the prior year\u2019s downward adjustment.",

The broader context shows that JNJ's total U.S. sales across all segments grew by 10.6% in 2023, suggesting that the MedTech restructuring contributed to a stronger U.S. performance relative to other regions.

      "question": "How does the $189M decline in Adjusted Operating Income specifically in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment correlate with the Health Care Benefits segment maintaining a stable $46.6B asset base from 2023 to 2024, particularly in light of the $747M restructuring charges recorded during the same period?",
      "answer": "The $189M decline in Adjusted Operating Income in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, driven by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, contrasts with the Health Care Benefits segment's asset base remaining unchanged at $46.6B from 2023 to 2024. This stability in asset value occurred despite $747M in restructuring charges (primarily from lease write-downs) that were recorded company-wide during 2024. While the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment faced margin pressures, the Health Care Benefits segment's consistent asset base suggests minimal restructuring impact on its infrastructure or operations, potentially indicating a strategic focus on maintaining scale in health plan services even as other segments underwent cost-cutting measures.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "The $20.7 billion in net cash consideration paid for Cytiva, as disclosed on page 83, dwarfs the $1.4 billion in total net cash consideration for the 13 acquisitions made in 2021, as shown on page 84. This stark contrast underscores the strategic significance and outsized financial commitment to the Cytiva Acquisition compared to other smaller, complementary acquisitions. Furthermore, the allocation of such a large sum to Cytiva aligns with its role in expanding DHR's Life Sciences segment's geographic and product line diversity, as noted in the narrative section on page 83, indicating a major strategic pivot rather than an incremental growth move.",

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million.

      "answer": "The Januvia/Janumet product line, part of MRK's human health division, experienced a 33% revenue decline overall in 2024, with 29% decline when excluding foreign exchange impacts, indicating FX exacerbated the revenue drop. In contrast, Bravecto animal health sales grew 6% (or 8% excluding FX), suggesting that FX pressures were dampened in this division. The Animal Health segment commentary reveals that foreign exchange was a headwind, with the Argentine peso devaluation contributing 2 percentage points of negative FX impact, yet this was offset by pricing adjustments. This contrast suggests Januvia/Janumet may have greater exposure to FX volatility in key markets, while the Animal Health division demonstrated better resilience or hedging, as FX effects were neutralized or even turned positive for Bravecto. This reflects differing geographic footprints and currency risk management effectiveness between the two business lines.",

The devaluation of the A rgentine peso contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market.\n\nSales of livestock products grew 4% in 2024 primarily due to higher pricing, increased demand for poultry and swine products, as well as the inclusion of sales from the July 2024 acquisition of the aqua business of Elanco A nimal Health Incorporated (Elanco aqua business). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business.\n\nSales of companion animal products grew 6% in 2024 reflecting higher pricing. Sales of the Bravecto line of products were $1.1 billion in 2024, an increase of 6% compared with 2023, or 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\n\n",

      "question": "Given the decline in UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations despite an increase in its total revenues, how does the segment's operating margin performance reconcile with the overall consolidated operating margin trend for the company?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations decreased by $831 million in 2024 despite an $16,848 million increase in its total revenues, resulting in a drop in its operating margin from 5.8% in 2023 to 5.2% in 2024. Meanwhile, the consolidated operating margin for the company also declined, from 8.7% in 2023 to 8.1% in 2024. This indicates that while UnitedHealthcare experienced revenue growth, its profitability as a percentage of revenue weakened, contributing to a broader downward trend in the company's overall operating margin. This divergence between revenue growth and margin contraction at the segment level highlights operational inefficiencies or cost pressures specific to UnitedHealthcare.",

      "question": "How does the change in Diagnostics segment assets from 2022 to 2023 align with the reported depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses for the same segment, and what might this indicate about the company's investment and asset management strategy in the Diagnostics business?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the Diagnostics segment's assets increased slightly from $6,875 million to $6,910 million, indicating minimal asset growth. During the same period, the Diagnostics segment's depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense was $577 million in 2023, down from $590 million in 2022. This modest decline in D&A, despite stable asset levels, may suggest that the company is either extending the useful lives of its assets or experiencing lower recent capital expenditures in the Diagnostics segment. Given the slight increase in asset value and the reduction in D&A, DHR may be managing its Diagnostics segment with a focus on optimizing existing assets rather than significant new investment.",

      "answer": "The 'Other Assets and Liabilities, Net' for Cytiva shows a net liability of $386 million, whereas the aggregated 'Other' entities in similar acquisition disclosures reflect a much smaller net liability of $104 million. This significant difference suggests that Cytiva's balance sheet structure is far more complex compared to the other acquired businesses. The larger net liability for Cytiva indicates a greater volume or complexity of miscellaneous balance sheet items that did not fit into standard asset or liability categories, pointing to more intricate integration challenges post-acquisition.",

The impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2021.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins were 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 19.0% in 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points\n- 2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points.\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points",

      "question": "How does Optum Insight's 25% year-over-year increase in earnings from operations align with its $22.4 billion contract backlog as of December 31, 2021, especially considering the multi-year delivery nature of its arrangements?",
      "answer": "Optum Insight reported a 25% year-over-year increase in earnings from operations\u2014rising from $2.725 billion in 2020 to $3.398 billion in 2021\u2014indicating strong profitability growth. This growth aligns with the $22.4 billion contract backlog as of December 31, 2021, which Optum Insight disclosed consists largely of long-term arrangements often spanning several years. The significant backlog suggests a stable and growing pipeline of multi-year commitments, which likely supports sustained revenue and earnings over time. Given the extended delivery nature of these contracts, the earnings growth in 2021 may reflect both revenue recognition from ongoing contracts and the ramp-up of new arrangements, demonstrating the financial impact of Optum Insight\u2019s ability to secure long-term contracts with life sciences and healthcare clients.",

      "answer": "The $132 million in acquisition-related integration costs disclosed in 2021 represents a decrease from the $332 million recorded in 2020, which was entirely allocated to the Corporate/Other segment. This $332 million directly contributed to the Corporate/Other segment\u2019s $1.641 billion operating loss in 2020, indicating that acquisition-related integration costs were a significant cost component affecting the segment\u2019s financial performance. The decrease in 2021 suggests a reduction in integration activity, but the prior-year impact highlights how these costs are concentrated in Corporate/Other and materially influence its operating results.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group received $1.4 billion in capital distributions from its subsidiaries in 2022, indicating a significant financial dependence on these inflows. Optum, as a core subsidiary segment, includes Optum Rx, which is explicitly identified as a primary contributor to UnitedHealth Group's revenue growth. The financial statements show that increases in UnitedHealth Group's consolidated revenues were 'primarily driven by growth in Optum Rx.' This suggests that Optum Rx's revenue performance directly supports the financial flows from Optum to the parent company, aligning its operational success with the broader capital structure of UnitedHealth Group.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities.

      "answer": "UnitedHealth's Cost of Products Sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers, along with rebate adjustments that directly reduce this expense. These rebates are accrued as a reduction of both cost of products sold and product revenue. The estimation of these costs relies on observed medical cost trend factors and rebate accruals, which are updated based on recent claims and rebate data. This approach affects the accuracy and timing of cost recognition, which in turn impacts the broader Total Operating Costs. In 2024, Total Operating Costs reached $4,652 million, reflecting not only the direct cost of pharmaceuticals but also the net effect of rebate adjustments and estimation methodologies applied to medical cost trends. Therefore, the way UnitedHealth accounts for these cost components directly influences its overall operating cost structure and financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndemographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the ex tent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nIn July 2024, the Company amended its Medicare Supplement Program with a membership organization (the Medicare Supplement Program). The amendments provide the Company the right to use a trade name and other intellectual property in marketing efforts for Medicare Supplement offerings. Amounts previously reported as assets under management are now included within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon their classification.\n\nFor periods prior to the amended Medicare Supplement Program, the Company excluded the effects of certain balance sheet amounts in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while these effects are included for periods after the amendments.\n\n## Other Current Receivables\n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Adjusted Operating Income from $18,037 million in 2022 to $17,534 million in 2023 reconcile with the strategic expansion of the Health Services segment through acquisitions like Signify Health and Oak Street Health, and what might this suggest about the financial integration of these acquisitions?",
      "answer": "The Adjusted Operating Income of CVS declined from $18,037 million in 2022 to $17,534 million in 2023, despite the strategic expansion of the Health Services segment through acquisitions such as Signify Health and Oak Street Health. The Health Services segment, which saw increased scope due to these acquisitions, contributed $6,492 million to Adjusted Operating Income in 2022 and $5,110 million in 2021, indicating a growing trend before the drop in 2023. However, the decline in Adjusted Operating Income in 2023 suggests that the integration of these acquisitions may not have yet yielded immediate financial benefits or that integration costs and operational adjustments (such as restructuring charges of $507 million in 2023) may have offset early gains. This raises questions about the short-term financial impact of these strategic moves and the effectiveness of integration efforts.",

      "question": "What does the composition and growth of Optum Insight's $32.1 billion backlog indicate about its strategic role in supporting UnitedHealth Group's integrated healthcare delivery model, particularly in light of its segment-specific operational responsibilities?",
      "answer": "Optum Insight\u2019s $32.1 billion backlog, with $18.7 billion expected to be realized within the next 12 months, indicates strong and growing demand for its analytics, technology, and health care solutions across a range of stakeholders including hospital systems, health plans, and governments. This backlog growth from $30.0 billion in 2022 to $32.1 billion in 2023 reflects increasing reliance on Optum Insight\u2019s capabilities, which are described in the segment financial information as essential for improving performance, achieving efficiency, reducing costs, and modernizing core operating systems. Given that Optum Insight is one of four reportable segments and is positioned to provide integrated services across UnitedHealth Group\u2019s ecosystem\u2014including to its affiliated segments like UnitedHealthcare and Optum Rx\u2014it plays a foundational role in enabling data-driven care coordination, cost management, and regulatory compliance. This aligns with UnitedHealth Group\u2019s broader strategy of integrating medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care to create a more efficient, consumer-centric healthcare delivery model.",

        "Hop 1: UNH (page_66) \u2192 Optum Insight: Optum Insight is one of four reportable segments of UnitedHealth Group, focused on delivering analytics, technology, and health care solutions to improve performance and efficiency.",

        "Hop 3: Backlog \u2190 UNH (page_5): The backlog is described as a key performance metric representing revenue from signed contracts and anticipated renewals, indicating strong forward-looking demand for Optum Insight\u2019s services."

      "answer": "Optum's earnings from operations increased by $1,949 million (19%) between 2020 and 2021, rising from $10,046 million to $11,995 million. During the same period, affiliated customer revenues for Optum grew by $10,825 million (14%), from $80,042 million in 2020 to $90,867 million in 2021. This indicates that the growth in Optum\u2019s earnings outpaced the growth in affiliated revenues, suggesting improved operational efficiency or margin expansion within Optum despite the increase in internal revenue.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment reported a $1.2 billion increase in Adjusted Operating Income in 2021, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy contributions (page_86). However, this occurred alongside a $1.176 billion decline in Health Care Benefits Adjusted Operating Income, which fell from $6,188 million in 2020 to $5,012 million in 2021 (page_80). Additionally, the Retail/LTC segment experienced a $431 million impairment charge in 2021 (page_152), signaling further pressure on that segment\u2019s performance. While the growth in Pharmacy Services helped offset some of the losses, the combined impact of declining profitability in Health Care Benefits and the Retail/LTC impairment suggests that CVS's overall segment diversification may be under strain, with disproportionate reliance on the performance of its Pharmacy Services division.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How did the 2023 $349 million loss on assets held for sale impact the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment's operating performance, and what does this suggest about the company's strategic asset management compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "The $349 million loss on assets held for sale in 2023 directly affected the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment\u2019s operating income, reducing its GAAP operating income of $5,349 million. This loss indicates that the segment was involved in restructuring or divestiture activities, likely related to underperforming or non-core assets. Comparing this to the prior year, where a significantly higher $2,533 million loss on assets held for sale was recorded, suggests that while asset-related losses remained a factor in 2023, the magnitude of such losses decreased considerably. This shift may reflect progress in CVS\u2019s strategic realignment, particularly as the segment was newly formed in early 2023 under a revised operating model. The decline in losses could signal more efficient asset management or a tapering of major restructuring actions taken in 2022, aligning with the company\u2019s broader strategy to streamline operations and focus on core pharmacy and wellness services.",

      "question": "How does the impact of Cytiva's acquisition on operating margin expansion relate to the pension liabilities assumed from Cytiva, particularly in light of how the company manages and discloses its broader pension obligations?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Cytiva contributed 210 basis points to the improvement in operating profit margins in 2021, primarily through acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue. However, the acquisition also brought significant pension liabilities of $423 million directly tied to Cytiva, as shown in the balance sheet. These liabilities are part of the company's broader pension obligations, which are disclosed in the footnotes as components of net periodic benefit costs, including actuarial losses and interest costs. The juxtaposition of Cytiva's margin-enhancing effects with its associated pension liabilities raises questions about the long-term financial implications of the acquisition, particularly as the company must now manage these liabilities alongside its existing pension obligations without the benefit of strategic divestiture or third-party transfer.",

The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points\n- 2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points.\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points",

These other components of net period benefit costs include the assumed rate of return on plan assets, partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest. The Company's net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of $7 million ($6 million after-tax) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its nonU.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third-party.\n\n## Investment Gains (Losses)\n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of investments in equity securities using the Fair Value Alternative and records adjustments to fair value within net earnings. Additionally, the Company is a limited partner in partnerships that invest primarily in early stage companies. While the partnerships record these investments at fair value, the Company's investments in the partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The investment gains (losses) include realized and unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities and the Company's equity in earnings of the partnerships that reflect the changes in fair value of the investments of the partnerships.\n\n## Gains on Sale of Product Lines\n\nDuring 2021 the Company divested certain product lines for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $26 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $13 million ($10 million after-tax). The divested product lines generated revenues of approximately $88 million in the Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment in 2020. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nAs a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company was required to divest certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment that in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. On April 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of these product lines for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2020. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\n## Loss on Early Extinguishment of Borrowings\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed the \u20ac800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings related to the payment of the make-whole premiums and deferred costs in connection with the redemption of $96 million ($73 million aftertax), which is reflected as a loss on early extinguishment of borrowings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.",

Segments of business and geographic areas\n\nFollowing the separation of the Consumer Health business in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, the Company is now organized into two reportable segments: Innovative M edicine and M edTech. The segment results have been recast for all periods to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM ) is the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer). For the Innovative M edicine and M edTech segments, the CODM uses segment income before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process. The CODM  considers planning-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis to assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources to the segments.\n\n",

      "answer": "The decline in Optum Insight's operating margin from 22.5% in 2023 to 16.5% in 2024 is directly tied to the $867 million business disruption impact caused by the Change Healthcare cyberattack. This margin compression reflects both lost revenue and increased operational costs as Optum maintained readiness of affected services during the incident. The cyberattack, disclosed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section, significantly disrupted Optum Insight\u2019s ability to generate revenue while incurring additional costs related to service restoration and customer support. This contextualizes the financial performance shown in the operating metrics and highlights how a strategic segment of Optum was financially impacted by an external event.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "question": "How does the $46.6 billion in Health Care Benefits assets as of 2024 contrast with the $189 million decline in adjusted operating income, and what does this suggest about the financial performance of this segment relative to its strategic scale?",
      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment grew its assets to $46.6 billion as of 2024, maintaining the same level from 2023 (chunk_1), yet its adjusted operating income declined by $189 million, or 3.2%, year-over-year (chunk_3). This decline was driven by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, despite increased prescription volume and improved drug purchasing (chunk_3). The contrast between asset scale and earnings contraction suggests that while the segment remains a core strategic component of CVS\u2019s portfolio, its profitability is under pressure despite its large balance sheet footprint. This may signal operational inefficiencies or market dynamics that are limiting the segment\u2019s ability to convert asset growth into earnings growth.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

How does this investment trend align with their disclosed therapeutic area focus in the Pharmaceutical business segment, and what might this indicate about their long-term R&D infrastructure priorities?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's capital expenditures for the Pharmaceutical segment rose from $863 million in 2020 to $1,198 million in 2021, a 39% increase. This significant investment aligns with the company's stated focus on six key therapeutic areas: Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. The increase in capital additions suggests a strategic commitment to strengthening R&D infrastructure and production capabilities in these high-priority therapeutic areas. This trend indicates that JNJ is likely expanding its capacity to develop and manufacture innovative therapies in these domains, reinforcing its long-term positioning in the pharmaceutical market and signaling confidence in the pipeline and commercial potential of products in these areas.",

The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

      "answer": "The $2,377 million total R&D expense for the Medical Devices segment in 2021 includes a substantial $900 million in-process research and development expense, which suggests that a significant portion of the segment's R&D investment was directed toward high-risk, early-stage innovation projects. This allocation could indicate a strategic emphasis on breakthrough technologies, but it may also raise questions about the efficiency of R&D spending, as in-process expenses are often associated with uncertain future returns. Evaluating this in the context of JNJ's broader innovation strategy, the segment appears to be prioritizing transformative R&D efforts, potentially at the expense of more incremental or near-term product development initiatives.",

      "answer": "Diagnostics' sales grew from $6,561 million in 2019 to $9,844 million in 2021, and operating profit increased from $1,134 million to $2,313 million, indicating strong performance. However, identifiable assets for Diagnostics remained nearly flat at around $14,442 million in 2019, $15,042 million in 2020, and $15,054 million in 2021. This suggests that the Diagnostics segment achieved significant financial growth without a corresponding increase in asset base, pointing to high capital efficiency. In contrast, Life Sciences saw a much larger increase in identifiable assets (from $22,381 million to $57,886 million) alongside its growth, indicating a more asset-intensive strategy. This contrast highlights differing capital deployment strategies across segments, with Diagnostics leveraging existing assets more efficiently for profit growth.",

Under  the agreement,  Merck  and  Eisai  will  develop  and  commercialize  Lenvima  jointly,  both  as  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with Keytruda . Eisai records Lenvima product sales globally (Eisai is the principal on Lenvima sales transactions) and Merck and Eisai share applicable profits equally. Merck records its share of Lenvima product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as  alliance  revenue.  Expenses  incurred  during  co-development  are  shared  by  the  two  companies  in  accordance  with  the collaboration agreement and reflected in Research and development expenses.

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "answer": "In 2024, JNJ allocated $1,710 million for Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) within the Innovative Medicine segment, an increase from $1,653 million in 2023 and $1,374 million in 2022. This upward trend in capital expenditure for Innovative Medicine, especially following the reorganization post-Consumer Health separation, suggests a strategic focus on strengthening this segment's infrastructure and capabilities. The increased allocation may reflect JNJ's intent to prioritize investment in its core pharmaceutical business, aligning with the CODM's resource allocation strategy based on segment performance and planning-to-actual variances.",

      "answer": "The MedTech segment's pre-tax income contribution decreased from $319 million in 2023 to $167 million in 2024, a drop of $152 million. This decline correlates with the acquisition and integration costs disclosed in the income before tax section, where $1.0 billion was attributed to the Shockwave acquisition in 2024 and earlier, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in integration costs related to Abiomed were disclosed in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

      "answer": "The 20.6% increase in Adjusted Operating Income for the Pharmacy Services segment in 2021 was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. Despite segment assets remaining flat at $23,615 million from 2020 to 2021 and the recognition of impairment charges in the broader context, the profitability improvement was attributed to enhanced rebate and fee structures. However, this growth was partially offset by ongoing price compression and competitive pressures in the PBM industry, which have limited the Company's ability to maintain pricing differentials and spread. These dynamics highlight how operational efficiencies and strategic client service offerings can drive profitability even in the face of asset stagnation and impairment impacts.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "DHR's 2023 operating profit margin declined by 660 basis points compared to 2022, with 40 basis points of that decline directly attributed to acquisition-related transaction costs, settlement of pre-acquisition share-based payment awards, and fair value adjustments tied to the Abcam acquisition. These costs were also explicitly excluded from pro forma net earnings, where $27 million in acquisition-related transaction costs were removed to present unaudited pro forma results.

      "answer": "J&J's litigation expense had a notable negative impact on the Innovative Medicine segment's pre-tax income in 2024, with a litigation expense of $0.4 billion primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia, compared to favorable litigation-related items of $0.1 billion in 2023. This $0.5 billion swing in litigation-related items contributed to the decline in the segment's income before tax as a percent of sales, which fell from 33.3% in 2023 to 33.2% in 2024. Despite other favorable factors such as the monetization of royalty rights and lower restructuring charges, the litigation expense weighed on the segment's profitability. Furthermore, the segment's pre-tax income reported in another section shows a significant drop from $479 million in 2023 to $102 million in 2024, reinforcing the adverse effect of litigation costs on the segment's financial performance.",

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&amp;D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV  development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024 was recorded in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n32",

      "question": "What is the relationship between the growth in Merck's Pharmaceutical segment sales from 2022 to 2023 and the corresponding increase in equity income from affiliates during the same period?",
      "answer": "Merck's Pharmaceutical segment sales grew from $52,005 million in 2022 to $53,583 million in 2023, an increase of $1,578 million. During the same period, equity income from affiliates increased from $39 million to $111 million, a rise of $72 million. This suggests that the growth in the Pharmaceutical segment may have contributed to the increase in equity income from affiliates, although the proportional increase in equity income is significantly higher than the segment sales growth, indicating potentially improved returns from affiliate relationships or specific one-time gains.",

      "question": "How did the $1.1 billion contingent consideration reversal from the Auris Health acquisition impact the Medical Devices segment's 2021 expense reporting, and what does this suggest about Johnson & Johnson's strategic focus in surgical robotics development?",
      "answer": "The $1.1 billion contingent consideration reversal in 2021, specifically tied to the Auris Health acquisition within the Medical Devices segment, significantly influenced the segment's financial reporting by reducing expenses related to developmental milestones. This reversal, stemming from the timing of milestones associated with Auris Health's surgical robotics technology, directly improved the segment's operating results. When viewed alongside the Medical Devices segment's $2,377 million R&D expense in 2021 (8.8% of sales), this reversal suggests that Johnson & Johnson maintained a strong commitment to surgical robotics innovation despite potential delays in milestone achievements. The reversal reflects management's strategic decision-making in acquisition accounting, signaling ongoing confidence in the long-term value of the Auris platform despite short-term developmental timing shifts.",

      "question": "How does the 6% net sales growth in the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure segment relate to the performance and strategic emphasis on Cardiac Rhythm Management, particularly in light of supply chain disruptions and the discontinuation of the HVAD System?",
      "answer": "The 6% net sales growth in the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure segment in fiscal year 2022, as reported on page 66, was primarily driven by strong performance in Cardiac Rhythm Management, including growth in TYRX antibacterial envelopes, CRT-Ds, and cardiac pacing therapies such as Micra and transvenous pacemakers. Despite the discontinuation of the HVAD System in mid-2021, which contributed to a decline in that sub-segment, the overall segment maintained growth due to robust demand in other areas of Cardiac Rhythm Management. This strategic emphasis is further contextualized on page 37, where supply chain disruptions are noted as a headwind, yet the recovery of global procedure volumes and recent product launches helped offset these challenges. The resilience of Cardiac Rhythm Management within a complex macroeconomic environment underscores its strategic importance to the broader Cardiovascular division's performance.",

The financial impact of the conflict in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material and for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets. Although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains, resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance.\n- Competitive  product  launches  and  pricing  pressure,  geographic  macro-economic  risks  including  general  price  inflation,  rising interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n- National and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China.\n\n## Cardiovascular\n\nCardiovascular  products  include  pacemakers,  insertable  cardiac  monitors,  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  devices,  implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems,  heart  valve  replacement  technologies,  cardiac  tissue  ablation  systems,  and  open  heart  and  coronary  bypass  grafting  surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2022 were $11.4 billion, an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2022 of $32 million. The net sales increase was primarily due to the recovery of global procedure volumes from the declines experienced in fiscal year 2021 along with growth from recent product launches, partially offset by global supply chain disruptions and declines in China due to recent COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2022 and 2021:\n\nCardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales increased 6 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led by Cardiac Rhythm Management with growth in TYRX antibacterial envelopes, CRT-Ds, and cardiac pacing therapies due to Micra and transvenous pacemakers. Cardiac Ablation Solutions also led growth with strong sales of Arctic Front cryoablation systems. The net sales growth was partially offset by a decline of Medtronic HVAD System net sales as a result of our June 2021 decision to stop the",

      "answer": "In 2024, JNJ allocated $2,443 million to Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) for the MedTech segment, which is higher than its 2023 spending of $2,372 million and significantly more than the $1,710 million allocated to the Innovative Medicine segment in the same year. This indicates a strategic emphasis on expanding or upgrading MedTech infrastructure compared to other segments, aligning with JNJ's decision to prioritize MedTech as a core business segment following the Consumer Health spin-off.",

For the Innovative M edicine and M edTech segments, the CODM uses segment income before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process.

      "question": "How does the Health Care Benefits segment's exposure to adverse selection risk in Public Exchange products relate to the $8.7 billion IBNR liabilities as of December 31, 2023, particularly in light of the segment's historical challenges in accurately projecting utilization patterns?",
      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment faces competitive and pricing pressures in Public Exchange products due to price transparency and entrants with lower cost structures, which could reduce profit margins and expose the company to adverse selection risk\u2014where individuals with higher medical needs disproportionately enroll. This risk directly affects the accuracy of the company's projections for membership health status and service utilization, which underpin premium rate setting. Given that the segment reported $8.7 billion in IBNR liabilities as of December 31, 2023\u2014largely tied to the current calendar year\u2014it is evident that the company must rely heavily on actuarial estimates to account for unreported or developing claims. However, historical data from 2022 and 2023 shows that actual completion factors were higher than estimated, leading to downward adjustments in healthcare costs payable by $32 million and $55 million respectively, indicating persistent challenges in accurately forecasting utilization trends. This suggests that the adverse selection risk in Public Exchange products could exacerbate estimation uncertainty embedded in the IBNR liabilities, impacting financial obligations and profitability.",

        "Hop 1: [CVS](page_48) \u2192 [Health Care Benefits Segment]: The segment faces competitive pressures and adverse selection risk in Public Exchange products, which could impact profitability and the accuracy of premium rate projections.",
        "Hop 2: [Health Care Benefits Segment] \u2192 [IBNR Liabilities]: The segment's financial exposure is closely tied to its ability to estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, which are developed using actuarial assumptions subject to change based on actual claims experience.",
        "Hop 3: [IBNR Liabilities] \u2190 [CVS](page_162): As of December 31, 2023, the company reported $8.7 billion in IBNR liabilities, with a significant portion subject to estimation uncertainty due to historical variations in completion factors."

These acquisitions were a key driver of the segment's goodwill balance growth, which increased from $8,314 million at the end of 2022 to $12,221 million by the end of 2023.

      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment experienced a decrease in Adjusted Operating Income from $6,188 million in 2020 to $5,012 million in 2021, indicating a segment-specific challenge. However, this decline was offset by a $1.2 billion increase in consolidated Adjusted Operating Income, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and client retention strategies in the Pharmacy Services segment. Despite the Health Care Benefits segment's performance, the overall company saw gains from increased contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy, which were partially offset by price compression. This suggests that while the Health Care Benefits segment underperformed, the strategic focus on purchasing economics and client retention in Pharmacy Services had a stronger, positive impact on the company's consolidated financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "CVS's Health Services segment saw a significant increase in assets from $23,615 million in 2022 to $34,066 million in 2024, indicating substantial investment. However, Adjusted Operating Income for the consolidated company declined by $189 million (3.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023, partly due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume. This decline in profitability, despite asset growth in Health Services, suggests a potential reduction in return on investment for that segment. The segment\u2019s Adjusted Operating Income was $7,243 million in 2024, down from $7,312 million in 2023, indicating flat-to-negative performance relative to asset expansion. Thus, the Health Services segment may be underperforming relative to its capital investment, especially under increasing reimbursement pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "Given UnitedHealthcare's significant contribution to consolidated earnings from operations and its diverse business lines, how does the 14% year-over-year increase in UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations align with its revenue growth of 13% and its role as the largest revenue-generating segment?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealthcare, as the largest segment of UNH, contributed $281.36 billion in revenues in 2023, representing 13% year-over-year growth. This revenue growth directly supported a 14% increase in earnings from operations, rising from $14.379 billion in 2022 to $16.415 billion in 2023. Despite the near parity in percentage growth (13% revenue vs 14% earnings), the alignment suggests strong operational efficiency within the segment, as the earnings growth slightly outpaced revenue growth. This indicates that UnitedHealthcare, which includes Employer & Individual, Medicare & Retirement, and Community & State lines, managed to improve or maintain its operating margin (5.8% in both 2023 and 2022), despite the scale of its operations and regulatory complexity. The consistency in margin, paired with double-digit revenue and earnings growth, reflects effective cost management and favorable market dynamics across its diverse customer base.",

      "question": "How does the trend in Life Sciences Solutions' segment depreciation expense compare with its proportion of consolidated revenues, and what does this suggest about the capital intensity of this segment relative to its revenue contribution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Life Sciences Solutions reported a depreciation expense of $220 million, which represents a 2.2% share of the total consolidated depreciation ($1,068 million). However, the segment contributed $9,977 million in revenues, accounting for 23.3% of total consolidated revenues ($42,857 million). This indicates that Life Sciences Solutions is relatively less capital-intensive compared to its revenue contribution, as its depreciation burden is disproportionately smaller than its revenue share. This contrast suggests that the segment may be leveraging its assets more efficiently or operating with a lighter asset base compared to other segments.",

      "question": "Given UnitedHealth Group's reliance on Optum for $252.957 billion in revenue and a 6.6% operating margin in 2024, how does the parent company's financial dependency on Optum reconcile with the observed 0.4 percentage point decline in Optum's operating margin year-over-year, especially as the parent company received $19.3 billion in dividends from subsidiaries in 2024?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's parent company receives significant dividends ($19.3 billion in 2024) from its subsidiaries, including Optum, which contributes $252.957 billion in revenue to the consolidated entity. However, Optum's operating margin declined by 0.4 percentage points year-over-year to 6.6% in 2024, driven by performance shifts in its subsegments such as Optum Insight\u2019s margin drop from 22.5% to 16.5%. This margin contraction suggests increased cost pressures or strategic investments that may impact future dividend capacity, creating a tension between current financial reliance and long-term profitability sustainability.",

      "question": "What explains the divergence between the modest 2.8% year-over-year sales growth in the Innovative Medicine segment and its significant 16.6% increase in income before tax, and how does this reflect on J&J's overall segment profitability allocation?",
      "answer": "The Innovative Medicine segment reported sales of $11,963 million in 2023, up from $11,642 million in 2022, representing a modest 2.8% year-over-year growth. However, its income before tax rose from $15,647 million to $18,246 million, a 16.6% increase. This divergence suggests improved operating leverage or margin expansion within the segment, as the growth in income before tax outpaced sales growth. This trend contributes to the overall profitability of J&J, where the Innovative Medicine segment accounts for a dominant $18,246 million of the $22,915 million total income before tax, indicating a strategic emphasis on high-margin pharmaceutical operations.",

      "answer": "The 2021 store impairments for the Retail/LTC segment totaled $1,358 million, a significant expense that was isolated to that segment and contributed to its adjusted operating income declining from $7,623 million to $5,322 million on a GAAP basis. Despite this impairment charge, the Retail/LTC segment remained a major contributor to CVS\u2019s consolidated adjusted operating income of $17,312 million, indicating that while store impairments had a material negative impact on the segment\u2019s GAAP profitability, the broader operational performance remained strong. This suggests that CVS may have been proactively addressing underperforming assets within the Retail/LTC segment as part of a strategic realignment, even as the segment continued to contribute meaningfully to the company\u2019s overall financial health.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has three operating segments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenues from the federal government accounted for 17%, 16% and 16%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.",

      "answer": "The $185 million capital expenditure for the Established Pharmaceuticals segment in 2023 reflects Abbott's strategic emphasis on sustaining and enhancing its mature product portfolio through geographic expansion and continuous product improvements. This aligns with the segment's R&D approach, which centers on lifecycle management rather than primary research, focusing on activities such as bioequivalence studies, formulation enhancements, and regulatory approvals in new markets. The relatively high level of investment compared to prior years ($175 million in 2022 and $169 million in 2021) suggests a consistent commitment to maintaining and extending the commercial viability of existing products across different regions, particularly in markets like China where regulatory timelines can be lengthy.

      "answer": "JNJ's Pharmaceutical segment experienced a 21.0% increase in R&D spending in 2021 compared to the prior year, which aligns with a significant increase in additions to property, plant, and equipment, rising from $863 million in 2020 to $1,198 million in 2021. This suggests that JNJ is not only investing in innovation through R&D but also expanding its physical infrastructure to support the pharmaceutical business. The simultaneous growth in both metrics indicates a strategic push to strengthen the segment's operational and developmental capabilities.",

Segments of business and geographic areas\n\nFollowing the separation of the Consumer Health business in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, the Company is now organized into two reportable segments: Innovative M edicine and M edTech. The segment results have been recast for all periods to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM ) is the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer). For the Innovative M edicine and M edTech segments, the CODM uses segment income before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process. The CODM  considers planning-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis to assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources to the segments.\n\n",

      "question": "Given the decline in UNH's consolidated operating margin from 8.7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021, how does the strong performance of Optum Insight\u2014showing a 27.9% operating margin in 2021\u2014align with the company's overall operating margin trend, especially considering Optum Insight's significant $22.4 billion backlog and long-term contract structure?",
      "answer": "Although UNH's consolidated operating margin declined slightly from 8.7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021, Optum Insight demonstrated strong profitability with a 27.9% operating margin in 2021, up from 25.2% in 2020. This suggests that Optum Insight outperformed the company's overall margin trend. Optum Insight's ability to maintain and grow its operating margin, despite the broader decline, may be attributed to its long-term contract structure and substantial $22.4 billion backlog as of December 31, 2021, which provides revenue visibility and stability. This contrast highlights Optum Insight as a high-performing and strategically resilient segment within UNH, capable of sustaining profitability even amid broader margin pressures.",

      "question": "Given the strong sales growth in Abbott's Established Pharmaceuticals segment in emerging markets, how does the level of capital investment in property and equipment for this segment in 2023 compare to prior years, and what might this indicate about Abbott's strategic commitment to expanding its presence in these markets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Abbott's Established Pharmaceuticals segment reported a 10.9% sales increase, driven by growth in emerging markets such as India, Vietnam, and Brazil. This growth aligns with Abbott's strategic focus on expanding its pharmaceutical business in these regions. Supporting this strategy, capital investment in property and equipment for the segment rose to $185 million in 2023, up from $175 million in 2022 and $169 million in 2021. The consistent increase in capital spending suggests that Abbott is reinforcing its operational infrastructure in emerging markets to sustain and potentially accelerate its sales momentum in the Established Pharmaceuticals segment.",

      "answer": "In 2021, the Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) for the Health Care Benefits segment increased from 80.9% to 85.0%, primarily due to higher COVID-19 related costs and the repeal of the Health Insurance Fee (HIF). However, for 2022, the Company projects that the MBR will decrease compared to 2021, driven by expected improvements in pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs, despite still anticipating a net negative impact from the pandemic. This shift reflects a strategic expectation of improved underwriting performance and lower pandemic-driven utilization.",

Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company's Insured Health Care Benefits products.\n- The MBR increased from 80.9% to 85.0% in 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by improved underlying performance in the current year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.\n- Operating expenses decreased $215 million, or 1.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by incremental operating expenses to support the growth in the Government Services business described above and the net impact of the sale of the Workers' Compensation business sold on July 31, 2020.",

The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021.

      "question": "How does Merck's treatment of $280 million in acquisition-related costs, including share-based compensation payments tied to the Acceleron acquisition, compare with its prior treatment of similar costs related to the ArQule acquisition as disclosed in different sections of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "Merck incurred $280 million in costs related to the Acceleron acquisition, primarily for share-based compensation payments to settle non-vested equity awards attributable to postcombination service, which were expensed in Selling, General and Administrative and Research and Development costs in 2021. This mirrors a similar expense structure for the ArQule acquisition in 2020, where $95 million of costs were incurred, consisting almost entirely of share-based compensation payments for non-vested equity awards. However, in the case of ArQule, an additional $138 million in share-based compensation was paid to settle equity awards for precombination service. This comparison reveals a consistent approach to recognizing share-based compensation as part of acquisition costs, but with notable differences in the magnitude and categorization of payments depending on the nature of the equity awards involved.",

(Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion. Acceleron is evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins that  is  known  to  play  a  central  role  in  the  regulation  of  cell  growth,  differentiation  and  repair.  Acceleron's  lead  therapeutic candidate,  sotatercept  (MK-7962),  has  a  novel  mechanism  of  action  with  the  potential  to  improve  short-term  and/or  long-term clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept is in Phase 3 trials as an add-on to current standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  PAH.  Under  a  previous  agreement  assumed  by  Merck,  Bristol  Myers  Squibb  (BMS)  was granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sotatercept outside of the pulmonary hypertension (PH) field (for which Merck would be eligible to receive contingent milestones and royalty payments), however, Merck retains the worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the PH field. The agreement provides for Merck to pay 22% royalties on future sales of sotatercept in the PH field to BMS.\n\nIn  addition  to  sotatercept, Acceleron's  portfolio  includes Reblozyl (luspatercept),  a  first-in-class  erythroid  maturation recombinant fusion protein that is approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood  disorders  and  is  also  being  evaluated  in  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  trials  for  additional  indications  for  hematology  therapies. Reblozyl is  being  developed  and  commercialized  through  a  global  collaboration  with  BMS.  In  connection  with  this  ongoing collaboration, Merck receives a 20% sales royalty from BMS which could increase to a maximum of 24% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Merck is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments including up to $20 million in regulatory milestones and up to $80 million in sales-based milestones.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination.

(IAVI),  a  nonprofit  scientific  research organization  dedicated  to  addressing  urgent,  unmet  global  health  challenges,  announced  a  collaboration  to  develop  V590,  an investigational  vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2  being  studied  for  the  prevention  of  COVID-19.  The  agreement  provided  for  an upfront payment by Merck of $6.5 million and also provided for future contingent payments based on sales. Merck also signed an agreement  with  the  Biomedical Advanced  Research  and  Development Authority  (BARDA),  part  of  the  office  of  the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to provide initial funding support to Merck for this effort. In January 2021, the Company announced it was discontinuing development of V590 as discussed below.\n\nIn January 2021, the Company announced the discontinuation of the development programs for its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, V590 and V591, following Merck's review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both  V590  and  V591  were  generally  well  tolerated,  but  the  immune  responses  were  inferior  to  those  seen  following  natural infection  and  those  reported  for  other  SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19  vaccines.  Due  to  the  discontinuation,  the  Company  recorded  a charge of $305 million in 2020, of which $260 million was reflected in Cost of sales and  related  to  fixed  assets  and  materials written off, as well as the recognition of liabilities for purchase commitments . The remaining $45 million of costs were reflected in Research and development expenses and represent amounts related to the Themis acquisition noted above (an IPR&amp;D impairment charge, partially offset by a reduction in the related liability for contingent consideration).\n\nIn  January  2020,  Merck  acquired ArQule,  Inc.  (ArQule),  a  publicly  traded  biopharmaceutical  company  focused  on kinase inhibitor discovery and development for the treatment of patients with cancer and other diseases. Total consideration paid of $2.7 billion included $138 million of share-based compensation payments to settle equity awards attributable to precombination service and cash paid for transaction costs on behalf of ArQule. The Company incurred $95 million of costs directly related to the acquisition  of  ArQule,  consisting  almost  entirely  of  share-based  compensation  payments  to  settle  non-vested  equity  awards attributable  to  postcombination  service.  These  costs  were  included  in Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses  in  2020. ArQule's  lead  investigational  candidate,  nemtabrutinib  (MK-1026),  is  a  novel,  oral  Bruton's  tyrosine  kinase  (BTK)  inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from ArQule is as follows:\n\n",

Despite the Established Pharmaceuticals segment achieving a 15% operating earnings increase, the capital investment allocation suggests a prioritization of growth opportunities in diagnostics and medical devices, which reported higher sales growth and strategic expansion focus in the narrative section.

      "question": "Given Optum Rx's role in providing pharmacy services to UnitedHealthcare and its 16% revenue growth in 2023, how does the increase in Optum Rx's earnings from operations relate to the overall operating margin decline in the Optum segment, and what does this suggest about the profitability dynamics within Optum Rx's business expansion?",
      "answer": "Optum Rx reported a 16% revenue increase in 2023, driven by higher script volumes and supply chain cost management, which contributed to its $679 million rise in earnings from operations. Despite this, the broader Optum segment experienced a decline in operating margin from 7.7% to 7.0%, indicating that the gains from Optum Rx were not sufficient to offset margin pressures in other Optum businesses. This suggests that while Optum Rx is growing profitably, its impact is being diluted by underperformance or margin compression in other parts of the Optum portfolio, such as Optum Health or Insight.",

        "Hop 1: UNH(page_66) \u2192 Optum Rx: Optum Rx is identified as a key segment offering pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, and clinical capabilities, and is noted for selling pharmacy products to UnitedHealthcare customers.",
        "Hop 2: Optum Rx \u2192 Earnings from Operations: Optum Rx\u2019s earnings from operations increased by $679 million in 2023, attributed to growth in pharmacy offerings, higher script volumes, and supply chain cost initiatives.",
        "Hop 3: Earnings from Operations \u2190 UNH(page_29): While Optum Rx\u2019s earnings improved, the overall Optum segment experienced a decline in operating margin from 7.7% to 7.0%, signaling that the segment as a whole faced profitability challenges despite Optum Rx\u2019s success."

      "question": "How does the $61 million acquisition purchase price adjustment reported in 2021 relate to the Health Care Benefits segment's operating income and its long-term asset balance as of December 31, 2021?",
      "answer": "The $61 million negative acquisition purchase price adjustment reported in 2021 under GAAP operating income directly affects the Health Care Benefits segment, which recorded this adjustment as a reduction to its operating income. Despite this reduction, the Health Care Benefits segment reported $3,521 million in GAAP operating income before adjustments, indicating that the adjustment had a relatively minor impact on its overall financial performance. However, when examining long-term assets, the Health Care Benefits segment maintained a balance of $45,130 million as of December 31, 2021, showing resilience despite the adjustment and no impairment charges recorded that year. This suggests that while the adjustment slightly reduced short-term operating income, it did not significantly affect the segment's long-term asset base.",

      "answer": "J&J's MedTech segment reported a significant increase in R&D spending, rising from $2,493 million in 2022 to $3,122 million in 2023, a 25.2% increase. Concurrently, capital additions to property, plant, and equipment for the MedTech segment rose from $2,120 million in 2022 to $2,372 million in 2023, a 11.9% increase. This suggests that J&J is aligning its infrastructure investment with its R&D commitments in the MedTech segment, indicating a strategic push to scale operations and support new product development. The coordinated increase across both spending categories implies a deliberate effort to strengthen the MedTech business through both innovation and operational capacity.",

      "answer": "The $1,318 million adjusted operating loss in the Corporate/Other segment in 2023, driven by $487 million in acquisition-related costs and $507 million in restructuring charges, directly contributed to the year-over-year decline in total adjusted operating income from $18,037 million in 2022 to $17,534 million in 2023. While the Health Care Benefits, Health Services, and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments all reported positive adjusted operating income in 2023, the significant costs associated with the strategic realignment\u2014including the integration of Signify Health and Oak Street Health\u2014negatively impacted the overall adjusted operating income. This reflects the short-term financial burden of the strategic changes, despite their long-term goal of enhancing care delivery capabilities and creating new sources of value through an integrated model.",

      "answer": "The decline in the percentage of Medicare Advantage members in 4+ star-rated plans from 91% in 2024 to 88% in 2025 suggests a slight reduction in the proportion of members that could qualify for bonus payments in 2026, which are tied to CMS star ratings. While this decrease may modestly constrain bonus payment eligibility, the proposed 2026 Medicare Advantage payment rates indicate an average industry revenue increase of 2.23%, which could offset some of the impact from the lower star-rated membership concentration. This implies that although the company's bonus payment potential may be slightly reduced, the broader payment rate environment for 2026 could support revenue growth in the Medicare Advantage segment if finalized as proposed.",

          "chunk_text": "Health Care Benefits products are sold through: the Company's sales personnel; independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business; as well as private health insurance exchanges ('Private Exchanges') and Public Exchanges (together with Private Exchanges, 'Insurance Exchanges'). For large employers or other entities that sponsor the Company's products ('plan sponsors'), independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health plan selection decisions and sales. In some instances, the Company may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with the Company. In certain cases, the customer pays the broker for services rendered, and the Company may facilitate that arrangement by collecting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. The Company supports marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.\n\nThe U.S. federal government is a significant customer of the Health Care Benefits segment through contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals and federal employee-related benefit programs. Other than the contracts with CMS, the Health Care Benefits segment is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of the segment. The loss of business from any one or a few independent brokers or agents would not have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. Health Care Benefits segment revenues from the federal government accounted for 18% of the Company's consolidated total revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 74%, 73% and 74%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues from the federal government in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Pricing\n\nFor Commercial Insured plans, contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.\n\nGenerally, a fix ed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contract inception. Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.\n\nThe Company has Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or 'capitation') payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fix ed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit the Company's exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to the Company for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantage products and all PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases, these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and higher health care and other benefit costs.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 'ACA') ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's 'star ratings.' Plans must have a star rating of 4 or higher (out of 5) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company's 2025 star ratings in October 2024. The Company's 2025 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company's Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2026. Based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2024, 88% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2025 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 91% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2023.",

      "answer": "The Innovative Medicine segment incurred higher milestone payments in 2023, which contributed to a decline in its pre-tax income margin despite overall improvements from cost reductions and R&D prioritization. According to JNJ's accounting policy, milestone payments made to third parties during the R&D phase are expensed as incurred, which directly impacts the segment's profitability. This is particularly significant in the context of the restructuring actions taken in the segment, which included exiting certain R&D programs in infectious diseases and vaccines, and resulted in $479 million in pre-tax restructuring expenses.

The Corporate & Other segment reported a negative Adjusted Operating Income of $1,318 million, which includes $487 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. These integration costs directly impacted the Corporate & Other segment\u2019s financial performance, reflecting the immediate financial burden associated with CVS\u2019s strategic expansion efforts. This aligns with the broader business strategy outlined in the overview section, which emphasizes investments in health services through acquisitions to enhance care delivery capabilities, despite short-term financial pressures.",

      "answer": "JNJ reported an expected return on plan assets of $(2,560) million for its Retirement Plans in 2024, indicating a projected credit against benefit costs based on actuarial assumptions. However, the company also disclosed that the Retirement Plans' investments were measured at fair value as of December 31, 2024, which suggests a separate, actual valuation of the plan assets. The negative expected return implies an actuarial assumption of underperformance relative to liabilities, while the fair value measurement reflects the actual market value of the assets at year-end. This contrast highlights the difference between projected actuarial assumptions and the realized financial position of the Retirement Plans, which could influence future funding requirements or adjustments in benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "CVS reports that gross premiums and net premiums are set equal for long-term care insurance contracts, meaning their present values are equivalent. This alignment ensures that the expected inflows from premiums fully cover the expected future benefit payments. Despite no material differences between actual and expected experience for significant assumptions, the ending liability for future policy benefits at the current discount rate decreased from $300 million at the beginning of the period to $293 million by the end of the period. This reduction reflects the net impact of interest accruals ($15 million) and actual net premiums collected ($39 million), offsetting the benefit payments and minor variances from expected experience.",

      "answer": "The $83 million depreciation allocated to Analytical Instruments in 2021 indicates the segment's existing asset base, while the $6 million in capital expenditures for the same year reflects the incremental investment in new assets. This relatively low capital expenditure compared to depreciation suggests that Analytical Instruments may be operating with a mature asset base requiring limited new investment, or that the company is prioritizing capital allocation elsewhere. For example, Life Sciences Solutions received $129 million in capital expenditures in 2021, significantly more than Analytical Instruments, despite having a larger depreciation charge ($197 million). This contrast implies a strategic decision to invest more heavily in growth areas like Life Sciences Solutions, even though Analytical Instruments still contributes meaningfully to consolidated depreciation at $83 million.",

      "question": "Given UNH's expressed dependency on provider relationships in Optum Health and the 30% year-over-year increase in Optum Health's earnings from operations, how does the company's operational performance in this segment align with its risk exposure related to provider contracting and network management?",
      "answer": "UNH's Optum Health segment reported a significant 30% increase in earnings from operations in 2021 compared to 2020, rising from $3,434 million to $4,462 million. However, the company also emphasized its substantial dependency on maintaining satisfactory relationships with healthcare providers, including physicians, hospitals, and other service providers, noting that disruptions in these relationships could materially affect its business. This dual context suggests that while Optum Health delivered strong financial performance, UNH remains exposed to risks tied to provider contracting, network design, and potential disputes that could impact both service delivery and profitability. The increase in earnings indicates successful operations despite these risks, but the qualitative warnings suggest that future performance could be sensitive to provider-related challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndemand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.\n\n## If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether innetwork or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management's attention from our operations and result in negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.\n\nSome providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in other cases the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us.\n\nThe success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers.\n\nIn addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

      "question": "Given the planned separation of JNJ's Consumer Health business, how does the increase in capital expenditures for this segment in 2021 compared to 2020 align with the company's strategy to spin off this unit?",
      "answer": "In 2021, JNJ reported capital expenditures (Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment) for the Consumer Health segment at $331 million, up significantly from $248 million in 2020, indicating increased investment in the segment. This increase appears to align with the company's strategic decision, announced in November 2021, to separate the Consumer Health business into a standalone publicly traded company. Despite the planned spin-off, the company continued to invest in the segment, possibly to strengthen its operational foundation ahead of the separation. This strategic reinvestment suggests JNJ aimed to position the Consumer Health business as a robust, independent entity capable of long-term value creation post-separation.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

      "question": "How does the 11.1% increase in operating expenses relate to the 13.8% operating expense ratio in 2024, and how does membership growth influence both metrics across the Health Care Benefits segment?",
      "answer": "The 11.1% increase in operating expenses is primarily driven by costs to support business growth, particularly in the Health Care Benefits segment. Despite this dollar increase, the operating expense ratio decreased to 13.8% of total revenues in 2024 from 15.3% in 2023, reflecting improved fixed cost leverage. This efficiency improvement is attributed to membership growth, which allowed the company to spread fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Membership growth, therefore, simultaneously supports cost efficiency (lower expense ratio) while necessitating higher absolute operating expenses to service the expanded member base.",

        "Hop 1: [CVS](page_81) \u2192 [Expense Ratio]: Operating expenses increased by $1.8 billion (11.1%) but decreased as a percentage of revenue (13.8% in 2024 vs 15.3% in 2023) due to membership growth.",
        "Hop 2: [Expense Ratio] \u2192 [Membership Growth]: Membership growth is cited as the key driver behind the improved fixed cost leverage that led to the lower operating expense ratio.",
        "Hop 3: [Membership Growth] \u2190 [CVS](page_82): Membership growth is also noted as a mitigating factor for the $5.3 billion (94.5%) decline in adjusted operating income, indicating its strategic importance in offsetting cost pressures."

      "question": "How did the Corporate/Other segment's $721 million in 2021 revenue align with the overall $1.2 billion year-over-year increase in consolidated adjusted operating income, especially given the price compression pressures acknowledged in the Pharmacy Services segment?",
      "answer": "The Corporate/Other segment reported $721 million in revenue in 2021 but also recorded an adjusted operating loss of $1.471 billion, indicating it was not a contributor to profitability (page_118). Despite this, the consolidated adjusted operating income increased by $1.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by gains in the Pharmacy Services segment from improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy contributions (page_86). However, this growth was partially offset by continued price compression pressures in the PBM industry, which constrain profitability by requiring PBMs to share more rebates and discounts with clients. Thus, while Corporate/Other was not a source of earnings growth, the consolidated increase suggests that the core operating segments\u2014particularly Pharmacy Services\u2014were able to overcome both internal (Corporate/Other losses) and external (price compression) pressures to deliver meaningful adjusted operating income growth.",

        "Hop 2: Corporate & Other \u2192 Adjusted Operating Income: The Corporate/Other segment's operating loss detracted from the overall adjusted operating income, yet the consolidated total still increased by $1.2 billion.",
        "Hop 3: Adjusted Operating Income \u2190 CVS(page_86): The $1.2 billion consolidated increase in adjusted operating income came primarily from the Pharmacy Services segment\u2019s improved purchasing economics, despite facing price compression pressures."

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "Amgen reported that the 2021 increase in XGEVA sales was primarily due to higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price. However, in the following section, the company also noted expectations for continued net selling price declines in 2022, specifically citing ENBREL's historical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter due to factors like benefit plan changes and increased patient deductibles. This indicates that while XGEVA experienced volume-driven growth in 2021, Amgen anticipates ongoing pricing pressures similar to those affecting ENBREL, suggesting a potential risk to future XGEVA revenue growth if pricing trends deteriorate further.",

      "answer": "The 53% total sales deductions rate reported for 2023, up from 51% in 2022, indicates a growing proportion of gross sales being offset by discounts, rebates, and chargebacks. This trend directly affects net revenue realization, especially for major products like ENBREL. ENBREL\u2019s sales decline in 2023 was explicitly attributed to 'unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions,' suggesting that higher deductions\u2014driven by factors such as increased U.S. rebate rates\u2014played a significant role in reducing net sales. Given that ENBREL is a mature product facing pricing pressures and payer-driven discounting, the rising deductions rate underscores the structural challenges in maintaining its revenue base, foreshadowing further declines in 2024 as noted in the forward-looking statements.",

      "answer": "The acquisition of Cytiva contributed $247 million to Danaher's total trade accounts payable of $2,569 million in 2021, representing approximately 9.6% of the total current liabilities related to trade accounts payable. This reflects the integration of Cytiva's balance sheet into Danaher's consolidated financial position, where Cytiva's trade accounts payable is now a subset of Danaher's overall current liabilities, indicating the operational scale of Cytiva within the broader corporate structure.",

        "Hop 1: [DHR](page_47) \u2192 [Cytiva]: DHR's 2021 sales increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Cytiva, which contributed significantly to core sales and operating profit margins.",

The impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2021.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins were 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 19.0% in 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points\n- 2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points.\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points",

      "question": "What factors enabled the Pharmacy Services segment to achieve a 20.6% increase in Adjusted Operating Income despite rising Intersegment Eliminations that reached $711 million in 2021?",
      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment achieved a 20.6% increase in Adjusted Operating Income in 2021 primarily due to improved purchasing economics, which reflected increased contributions from the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services, including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities. However, this growth was partially offset by continued price compression and competitive pressures in the PBM industry. Notably, Intersegment Eliminations increased to $711 million in 2021, reflecting a growing offset to intercompany transactions, which would have otherwise further elevated the Adjusted Operating Income.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "Amgen reported a decline in Aranesp sales in 2023 due to lower unit demand, specifically from independent and medium-sized dialysis organizations transitioning to EPOGEN, which is expected to continue impacting volume and net selling price. However, in a different section, Amgen claims to have achieved 'strong volume growth across our product portfolio' in 2023, citing volume increases for Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia, and BLINCYTO, as well as $954 million in sales from the Horizon acquisition. This apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that while Aranesp experienced volume loss, other products and the Horizon acquisition more than offset this decline, supporting Amgen\u2019s overall volume growth narrative.",

      "answer": "The $1.2 billion (20.6%) increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics in the Pharmacy Services segment, which benefited from a 6.9% increase in pharmacy claims processed in 2021 compared to 2020. This growth was fueled by net new business, increased new therapy prescriptions, and the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite the $431 million impairment in the Retail LTC segment reported in 2021, which reduced its contribution to adjusted operating income, the strong performance of the Pharmacy Services segment offset this decline. The Pharmacy Services segment's improved economics reflected increased contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services, although these gains were partially constrained by ongoing price compression pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "The $402 million in net realized capital losses attributed to the Health Care Benefits segment in 2023 represents a direct reduction in the segment's financial performance for that year. This loss is a component of the segment's overall operating income and adjusted operating income calculations, negatively affecting profitability. However, given the segment's total asset balance of $46,644 million as of year-end 2023, the capital loss constitutes a relatively small portion (less than 1%) of the total asset base, suggesting that while it had a measurable impact on annual performance, it did not materially alter the segment's long-term financial positioning or asset strength.",

How did the company achieve this growth despite the segment impairment and given the competitive pressures described in the operating income discussion?",
      "answer": "Despite the $431 million impairment in the Retail LTC segment in 2021, CVS achieved a 20.6% increase in Adjusted Operating Income primarily through improved purchasing economics driven by contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. These gains were supported by increased pharmacy claims processed (up 6.9% to 1.9 billion on a 30-day equivalent basis) and better client retention and acquisition efforts. However, the company also faced competitive pressures in the PBM industry that limited its ability to retain full rebate and discount benefits, as well as regulatory constraints on pricing models involving retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The impairment in Retail LTC did not derail overall profitability growth because the Pharmacy Services segment, which saw strong performance from specialty pharmacy and client services, was the primary driver of the company's adjusted operating income gains.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "The divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, which is part of the Health Care Benefits segment, resulted in a reduction of $505 million in the segment's balance from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020. This divestiture is directly tied to the consolidated income statement, where a negative 'Gain on Divestiture of Subsidiary' of $269 million was recorded under operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The negative gain indicates a loss on the transaction, suggesting that the divestiture not only reduced the segment's asset base but also had a direct adverse financial impact on CVS\u2019s consolidated operating income for that year.",

      "answer": "TMO reports long-term obligations of $32,333 million on page 88, which is derived from total borrowings at carrying value of $34,670 million, less short-term obligations and current maturities of $2,537 million. However, on page 97, the company notes that cumulative-basis adjustments for fair value hedges are included in long-term obligations, yet no specific dollar amount for these adjustments is provided in the long-term obligations section. This creates ambiguity about how the fair value hedge adjustments, which are known to impact the carrying value of debt instruments, are factored into the final long-term obligations figure. The lack of explicit quantification of these adjustments raises questions about the transparency and completeness of the reconciliation process between the fair value hedge impacts and the final long-term obligations balance.",

      "answer": "The consistent $184 million amortization of prior service cost for retirement plans in both 2022 and 2023 indicates that J&J has maintained a stable approach to managing its long-term pension obligations. This consistency aligns with J&J's sponsorship of various retirement plans globally, which are based on long-term assumptions like discount rates and expected returns. Despite market volatility reflected in the $1,437 million interest cost in 2023, the company's steady amortization suggests a deliberate, stable strategy for addressing legacy pension liabilities rather than reactive adjustments. This reflects a structured approach to pension management as part of its broader employee benefit planning.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment maintained stable segment assets of $23,615 million from 2019 to 2021 (page_152), while achieving a $1.2 billion (20.6%) increase in Adjusted Operating Income from 2020 to 2021 (page_80). This operational efficiency was primarily driven by 'improved purchasing economics' attributed to increased contributions from the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services, which offset the negative effects of continued price compression (page_86). The growth in income without asset expansion suggests strategic focus on optimizing existing infrastructure and enhancing revenue capture through improved rebate and fee management, despite competitive pressures that require sharing more rebates with clients and reduced flexibility in pricing strategies involving retail network 'differential' or 'spread'.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "The Retail/LTC segment incurred a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in 2021, which was excluded from GAAP operating income and added back in the calculation of adjusted operating income, contributing to the increase to $7,623 million from $5,322 million for that segment. However, in the broader context of the Pharmacy Services segment, adjusted operating income growth of 20.6% (to $17,312 million) was primarily attributed to improved purchasing economics and contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy, despite price compression. This contrast highlights that while the Retail/LTC segment experienced a significant one-time impairment, the overall adjusted operating income growth was framed around operational efficiencies and market dynamics in the Pharmacy Services segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "Given Johnson & Johnson's restructuring of its MedTech segment, which included exiting certain markets and product lines, how does the 7.7% increase in MedTech international sales contrast with the broader international sales performance of 1.9% growth for the company as a whole, and what might this indicate about the segment's international strategy?",
      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment reported a 7.7% increase in international sales, driven by operational growth of 10.6% despite a negative currency impact of 2.9%. This contrasts with the company's overall international sales growth of only 1.9% in 2023. The divergence suggests that the MedTech segment's targeted restructuring and strategic acquisitions, such as Abiomed, may have insulated or even accelerated its international performance relative to other segments. This indicates that the MedTech restructuring, while costly in the short term, may be contributing to stronger international positioning and growth.",

      "question": "How did the $90 million net realized capital losses in 2023 contribute to the Corporate & Other segment's overall operating loss of $2.4 billion, and what does this suggest about the segment's exposure to investment volatility?",
      "answer": "The $90 million net realized capital losses in 2023 accounted for approximately 3.75% of the Corporate & Other segment\u2019s total operating loss of $2.397 billion. This suggests that while investment volatility had a measurable impact on the segment\u2019s performance, it was relatively minor compared to other factors such as restructuring charges ($507 million) and acquisition-related costs ($487 million). The segment's operating loss is primarily driven by strategic corporate decisions and integration costs rather than market-driven investment losses. However, the presence of capital losses highlights the segment\u2019s exposure to financial market fluctuations, which could have a more significant impact if market conditions deteriorate further.",

      "answer": "In 2020, JNJ's Consumer Health segment reported a loss before tax of $1,064 million, contrasting with the profitability of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments. Despite this, the Consumer Health segment still held significant identifiable assets valued at $27,355 million, indicating a substantial capital investment relative to its financial performance. Against this backdrop, JNJ announced its strategic decision to separate the Consumer Health business into a standalone publicly traded company. This suggests that the company sought to realign its portfolio by divesting a segment that underperformed financially relative to its asset base and strategic positioning, potentially to focus on higher-margin areas like Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices, which reported stronger income before tax and more consistent profitability.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

      "answer": "The $507 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in the Corporate/Other segment, which includes large case pensions, may reflect cost-reduction efforts that could be linked to managing long-term liabilities such as pension obligations. The decline in the current discount rate for large case pensions from 5.24% in 2022 to 4.93% in 2023 implies that the present value of future pension liabilities has increased, as lower discount rates result in higher liability valuations. This dynamic suggests that CVS may be proactively addressing rising pension liabilities through restructuring activities, such as workforce optimization and asset impairments, to offset the financial impact of these increased obligations on the Corporate/Other segment.",

      "answer": "The Segment Income for Analytical Instruments in 2021 was $1,197 million, indicating a strong contribution to TMO's overall profitability. However, the restructuring charges allocated to the same segment in 2021 amounted to $6 million, as disclosed in the Corporate section. While restructuring charges typically signal strategic realignment or cost-cutting efforts, the relatively small size of the $6 million charge compared to the segment's $1,197 million income suggests that the Analytical Instruments segment remained operationally robust despite any internal adjustments. This implies that the segment's core operations were performing well, with the restructuring likely not significantly impacting its profitability.",

      "answer": "The $33.7 billion decrease in Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes was partially offset by a $1.6 billion net gain on equity securities recorded in 2023, compared to net losses on equity securities in 2022.

      "answer": "The Animal Health segment reported a profit of $1.938 billion in 2024, which is a key financial metric used by Merck\u2019s leadership for resource allocation. However, this segment faces significant risk from disease outbreaks and supply chain disruptions, as noted in the risk factors section. Specifically, Bravecto alone contributed $1.1 billion in sales in 2024, representing 19% of the segment\u2019s total sales. A negative event affecting Bravecto \u2014 such as an outbreak of a disease like Avian Influenza or African Swine Fever \u2014 could lead to reduced livestock populations, precautionary destruction, or decreased demand, directly impacting Bravecto\u2019s sales. Additionally, any disruption in manufacturing due to disease near production sites or supply chain constraints could halt production or increase costs. These risks, combined with Bravecto\u2019s outsized contribution, suggest that while the segment currently generates stable profits, its financial performance is vulnerable to external biological and operational risks that could significantly affect its long-term profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "answer": "CVS's Corporate & Other segment has consistently reported adjusted operating losses, declining from -$1,613 million in 2022 to -$1,348 million in 2024. Meanwhile, the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment faced significant pressures including pharmacy reimbursement declines and reduced front store volume, particularly due to the post-public health emergency drop in demand for COVID-19 OTC test kits. These pressures contributed to a $5,558 million decline in consolidated adjusted operating income from $18,037 million in 2022 to $11,976 million in 2024. Despite these challenges, the CEO continues to use adjusted operating income as the principal metric for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, suggesting a strategic commitment to this measure despite its limitations in capturing the full complexity of segment-level financial stress.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment faced margin pressures from competitive dynamics and regulatory changes, including the need to share more rebates with clients and reduced flexibility with retail network 'differential' pricing. Despite these pressures, adjusted operating income for the segment still increased by $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Meanwhile, the Retail/LTC segment reported a strong adjusted operating income of $7,623 million in 2021, up from $6,146 million in 2020, indicating robust profitability. Since the CODM evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on adjusted operating income, the Retail/LTC segment\u2019s significant contribution suggests a strategic emphasis on this area as a counterbalance to the Pharmacy Services segment's margin challenges. This alignment reflects the company's broader strategic resource allocation framework, which prioritizes performance metrics like adjusted operating income to guide investment and operational focus.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has three operating segments, Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income, which is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenues from the federal government accounted for 17%, 16% and 16%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.",

      "answer": "Abbott's 2023 strategic focus on expanding its Medical Devices business\u2014highlighted by acquisitions like Bigfoot Biomedical and CSI, as well as the growth of recently launched products\u2014aligns with a notable increase in capital investment. Specifically, Additions to Property and Equipment for the Medical Devices segment rose to $604 million in 2023, compared to $335 million in 2022 and $348 million in 2021. This nearly doubling of capital expenditure reflects the company's commitment to scaling its Medical Devices portfolio through both organic development and strategic acquisitions, as emphasized in the business overview section.",

      "answer": "The $290 million restructuring-related portion of Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses in 2023 indicates that Pfizer is actively pursuing cost containment measures, particularly in administrative functions, as part of its broader strategy to mitigate the impact of a significant $33.7 billion decline in Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes. This cost management approach appears to be a response not only to the immediate financial pressure but also to anticipated long-term revenue reductions from patent expirations between 2026 and 2030, which the company acknowledges as a material risk. By embedding restructuring charges within key expense categories like administrative costs, Pfizer is signaling a strategic effort to streamline operations and preserve profitability amid declining revenues and rising operational pressures.",

      "answer": "The Corporate/Other segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $1.471 billion in 2021, which slightly increased from $1.306 billion in 2020, thus dampening the overall growth in adjusted operating income. Despite this drag, CVS's consolidated adjusted operating income still increased by $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, driven primarily by the Pharmacy Services segment\u2019s improved purchasing economics, including contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. This contrast reveals that the company's core business units, particularly Pharmacy Services, were the key profitability drivers, compensating for the negative performance of the Corporate/Other segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "Given the decline in Adjusted Operating Income in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, how does the consistent reporting of Health Care Benefits segment assets from 2023 to 2024 reflect CVS's strategic positioning in its core health care services despite operational pressures?",
      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment experienced a 3.2% decline in Adjusted Operating Income in 2024, primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume. Despite this, the Health Care Benefits segment's assets remained unchanged at $46,644 million from 2023 to 2024, suggesting stability in its core health insurance and benefits offerings. This consistency in asset reporting contrasts with the operational challenges in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, indicating that CVS may be strategically prioritizing its health care benefits business as a stable revenue driver, even as it navigates reimbursement pressures and shifting consumer demand in retail pharmacy.",

The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How does the 3.2% decrease in adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment relate to the Medicare Advantage star rating challenges affecting the Health Care Benefits segment, and how might Signify Health's in-home evaluations help mitigate this dual financial pressure?",
      "answer": "The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment experienced a 3.2% decrease in adjusted operating income, driven by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower front store volume, including reduced contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. Meanwhile, the Health Care Benefits segment suffered a $5.3 billion drop in adjusted operating income, partly due to the unfavorable impact of Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year. These star ratings are tied to reimbursement levels and member satisfaction, and lower scores can directly reduce revenue. Signify Health's in-home evaluations (IHEs) are explicitly mentioned as a tool to improve HEDIS scores and Medicare Advantage star ratings by identifying and addressing care gaps. By enhancing health plans' performance metrics, IHEs could help reverse the negative financial impact from low star ratings. Therefore, while the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment faces margin pressure, and the Health Care Benefits segment experiences a major revenue hit due to regulatory performance metrics, Signify Health\u2019s capabilities may offer a strategic lever to improve both segments\u2019 performance by boosting star ratings and member engagement.",

ACOs that achieve performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS') are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.\n\n## In-Home Health Evaluations\n\nAs a complement to its value-based care delivery, the Company operates a large mobile network of credentialed providers in the U.S. through its Signify Health business. These credentialed providers are deployed into the home primarily to conduct in-home health evaluations ('IHEs') and perform select diagnostic services. IHEs may also be performed virtually or at a healthcare provider facility. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company performed more than 3 million IHEs. While in the home, providers perform IHEs with the assistance of the Company's longitudinal patient records and proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. The Company's software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of hundreds of data points. The Company also offers diagnostic and preventive services and provides comprehensive medication review services while in the home. Through its IHEs, the Company creates a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social and behavioral needs of its health plan customers' medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system.\n\nThe evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals' primary care physicians. The Company believes sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who have not regularly visited their PCP to schedule a visit. The IHEs also provide health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home and contribute to health plans' ability to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs such as Medicare Advantage. The data gathered during an IHE is also a resource that can be used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ('HEDIS') scores and Medicare Advantage star ratings.\n\n## MinuteClinic\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company operated more than 900 MinuteClinic locations in the U.S. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to deliver a variety of health care services. Payors value these clinics because they provide convenient, highquality, cost-effective care, in many cases offering an attractive alternative to more ex pensive sites of care. MinuteClinic also offers virtual care services to connect customers with licensed providers to provide access to health services remotely.

      "answer": "In 2023, net realized capital gains had a negative impact of $141 million on the Corporate & Other segment's operating loss, contributing to a reported operating loss of $1,629 million for that segment. This contrasts with the consolidated totals, where net realized capital gains reduced overall operating income by $176 million across the company.

Since the company explicitly states that debt ratings 'have a direct impact' on new store operating lease costs, maintaining or improving these ratings through cost savings could help mitigate the risk of higher lease expenses. However, the document also notes uncertainty around future actions by credit agencies, meaning the effectiveness of the cost savings in reducing lease costs is not guaranteed and depends on how credit agencies evaluate the company's improved financial metrics.",

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

      "question": "How does the 24% revenue growth reported by Optum in 2023 reconcile with its 13% increase in earnings from operations, particularly considering the varying operating margins across Optum's business lines?",
      "answer": "Optum reported a 24% revenue growth in 2023, increasing from $182,768 million in 2022 to $226,635 million in 2023. However, its earnings from operations increased at a slower rate of 13%, rising from $14,056 million to $15,943 million. This divergence suggests that while Optum expanded its top-line revenue significantly, the growth in operating costs or investments in certain business lines may have dampened the bottom-line growth. Specifically, Optum Health experienced a decline in operating margin from 8.5% to 6.9%, Optum Insight saw a drop from 24.6% to 22.5%, and Optum Rx's margin remained flat at 4.4%. These margin pressures likely contributed to the lower growth rate in earnings from operations relative to revenue, despite strong top-line performance.",

The contrast between the small amortization expense and the large projected benefit outflows raises questions about the funding adequacy and the assumptions underpinning the amortization of prior service costs. This suggests that either the company has structured its benefit liabilities to avoid significant new obligations (limiting amortization expense) or that future liabilities may not be fully reflected in current financial statements, potentially deferring costs to later periods.",

      "answer": "The Corporate & Other segment absorbed $332 million in acquisition-related integration costs in 2020, which were excluded from GAAP operating income but factored into adjusted operating income calculations. This contributed to the Pharmacy Services segment reporting a 20.6% increase in adjusted operating income to $5.688 billion in 2021 compared to $4.724 billion in 2020. While the Pharmacy Services segment attributes its growth to improved purchasing economics and increased contributions from specialty pharmacy services, the adjustment process effectively excludes certain non-core corporate expenses, potentially presenting a more favorable growth trajectory than would be apparent under strict GAAP measures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "TMO's Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment reported depreciation of $423 million in 2021, which is significantly higher than other segments and accounts for over half of the company's consolidated depreciation of $831 million. This indicates that the segment is highly asset-intensive compared to other business units. Additionally, the segment's depreciation increased from $292 million in 2019 to $423 million in 2021, outpacing the overall consolidated depreciation growth (from $564 million to $831 million), suggesting that TMO is directing a growing proportion of its capital investments toward this segment. This aligns with the segment's revenue growth and operational scale, as it was the second-largest revenue contributor at $14.86 billion in 2021.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson reported overall international sales growth of just 1.9% in 2023, reflecting muted performance across much of its global business. However, the MedTech segment stood out with a significantly stronger 7.7% increase in international sales, suggesting that this segment was a relative bright spot in JNJ's global operations. This divergence implies that MedTech may have been gaining traction internationally despite broader market challenges. Yet, the company initiated a restructuring program within the MedTech segment, including exiting certain markets and product lines, which incurred $319 million in pre-tax charges during 2023. This indicates that even though the segment was growing internationally, JNJ still saw a need to streamline operations and reallocate resources\u2014potentially to enhance long-term competitiveness and operational efficiency in key markets.",

      "question": "Given the risks outlined around Optum Health's value-based care arrangements and cost management challenges, how does the 18% year-over-year increase in Optum Health's earnings from operations align with the relatively flat operating margin of 7.4% in 2024 compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "Despite the risks outlined in the 10-K related to Optum Health's value-based care arrangements\u2014including the potential inability to deliver lower-cost, higher-quality care\u2014the segment's earnings from operations increased by 18% year-over-year to $7,770 million in 2024. However, the operating margin for Optum Health only rose modestly from 6.9% in 2023 to 7.4% in 2024, suggesting that while top-line growth and operational scale contributed to higher earnings, the margin expansion was constrained. This indicates that the cost pressures and risk-based pricing challenges described in the risk factors section are having a measurable impact on profitability, limiting margin growth despite strong earnings growth. The alignment suggests that while Optum Health is growing revenue and managing costs to some extent, the structural risks in value-based care are tempering the potential for stronger margin expansion.",

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "answer": "The separation of the Consumer Health business in 2023 led to JNJ being reorganized into the Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. The Innovative Medicine segment, which saw capital expenditures increase from $1,653 million in 2023 to $1,710 million in 2024, reflects a strategic decision to invest more in infrastructure and capabilities for this segment. This increase in capital allocation aligns with the company's focus on strengthening its Innovative Medicine business post-reorganization, as the CEO, acting as the Chief Operating Decision Maker, allocates resources based on segment income before tax and long-term strategic goals.",

For the Innovative M edicine and M edTech segments, the CODM uses segment income before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process.

      "answer": "The increase in sales deductions to 53% of gross product sales in 2023 indicates a growing pressure on net revenue realization, particularly for products like ENBREL. This aligns with the statement that ENBREL\u2019s 2023 sales decline was driven by 'unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions.' The higher deductions suggest increased rebates, chargebacks, or other discounting mechanisms, which directly reduce the net selling price of ENBREL. This dynamic contributes to lower reported sales despite potential stability or growth in gross volume, thereby reinforcing the observed year-over-year decline in ENBREL revenue.",

        "Hop 1: AMGN(page_83) \u2192 Sales Deductions: Sales deductions rose to 53% of gross product sales in 2023, driven by higher U.S. chargeback and rebate discount rates.",

        "Hop 3: ENBREL Sales \u2190 AMGN(page_72): ENBREL sales decreased in both 2023 and 2022, with sales deductions being a primary contributor alongside lower net selling prices and inventory levels."

Despite supply chain disruptions and declines in China due to COVID-19 lockdowns, CRM growth helped CRHF achieve $5.9 billion in net sales, up from $5.58 billion in fiscal year 2021. This aligns with the broader Cardiovascular portfolio's $11.4 billion in net sales, indicating CRM's significant role in sustaining CRHF's revenue performance.",

The financial impact of the conflict in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material and for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2022, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets. Although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains, resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance.\n- Competitive  product  launches  and  pricing  pressure,  geographic  macro-economic  risks  including  general  price  inflation,  rising interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n- National and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China.\n\n## Cardiovascular\n\nCardiovascular  products  include  pacemakers,  insertable  cardiac  monitors,  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  devices,  implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems,  heart  valve  replacement  technologies,  cardiac  tissue  ablation  systems,  and  open  heart  and  coronary  bypass  grafting  surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2022 were $11.4 billion, an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2022 of $32 million. The net sales increase was primarily due to the recovery of global procedure volumes from the declines experienced in fiscal year 2021 along with growth from recent product launches, partially offset by global supply chain disruptions and declines in China due to recent COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2022 and 2021:\n\nCardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales increased 6 percent in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021. The increase was led by Cardiac Rhythm Management with growth in TYRX antibacterial envelopes, CRT-Ds, and cardiac pacing therapies due to Micra and transvenous pacemakers. Cardiac Ablation Solutions also led growth with strong sales of Arctic Front cryoablation systems. The net sales growth was partially offset by a decline of Medtronic HVAD System net sales as a result of our June 2021 decision to stop the",

      "answer": "CVS reported a 3.2% decline in Adjusted Operating Income in 2024, primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower front store volume, including reduced contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. However, this decline was partially offset by increased Net Investment Income, which helped mitigate the overall impact on profitability. According to the Health Care Benefits segment report, Net Investment Income contributed positively to adjusted operating income. However, the company also disclosed significant risks to Net Investment Income stemming from adverse conditions in U.S. and global capital markets, including volatility in interest rates, reduced yields on reinvested proceeds, and potential defaults by third parties. These risks could materially reduce net investment income in the future, thereby undermining its ability to offset ongoing pressures in the core pharmacy business.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for ex ample, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital ex penditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\n## Adverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe U.S. and global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser ex tent the international financial markets. V olatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- lowering interest rates on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for ex ample if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;\n- reducing our ability to issue debt securities at attractive interest rates, thereby increasing our interest ex pense and decreasing our operating results; and\n- reducing our ability to issue other securities.\n\nAlthough we seek, within guidelines we deem appropriate, to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures, a failure to do so adequately could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and, in extreme circumstances, our cash flows.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors\n\n## We face risks relating to the market availability, pricing, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell.\n\nOur Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs. Our PBM business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. As a result, we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers.

      "question": "How did the Retail/LTC segment's cost structure improvements in 2022 interact with external pharmacy reimbursement pressures from payors to shape adjusted operating income growth?",
      "answer": "The Retail/LTC segment improved its cost structure in 2022 through better generic drug purchasing and enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which helped drive a 24.0% increase in adjusted operating income. However, this growth was tempered by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure from managed care organizations, PBMs, and government payors, which sought to reduce prescription drug costs through restrictive networks and lower reimbursement rates. Despite these pressures, the segment benefited from increased prescription volume and front store sales, though the adverse reimbursement environment limited the full profitability potential of these operational efficiencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Services segment achieved a $1.2 billion (20.6%) increase in adjusted operating income in 2021 through improved purchasing economics, particularly driven by increased contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. These gains were partially offset by continued price compression in the PBM market, which pressures margins. Notably, intersegment eliminations\u2014primarily reflecting internal transactions between business units\u2014reduced consolidated adjusted operating income by $711 million in 2021.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How does the $274 million acquisition impact reported in the Health Care Benefits segment's balance table reconcile with the $61 million negative purchase price adjustment recognized in the consolidated operating income reconciliation, and what does this imply about the long-term financial impact of acquisitions on CVS's operating performance?",
      "answer": "The $274 million acquisition impact in the Health Care Benefits segment (page_152) reflects additions to the segment's balance from acquisitions during 2020. This indicates that CVS made acquisition-related investments in this segment. However, in the consolidated operating income reconciliation (page_185), a $61 million negative purchase price adjustment is recognized 'outside of the measurement period' for 2021. This adjustment, which reduces operating income, represents a post-acquisition accounting correction that emerged after the initial 12-month measurement period for purchase accounting had closed. The connection through the Acquisition Purchase Price Adjustment metric shows that while acquisitions initially boost segment balances, they can later result in downward adjustments that directly affect consolidated operating income. This implies that acquisition activity may have longer-term financial consequences for CVS beyond the initial reporting period, potentially offsetting some of the expected benefits from expansion.",

This segment reported an operating loss of $2,397 million for 2023, indicating that acquisition costs significantly contributed to this loss. The overview on page 5 highlights that CVS completed major acquisitions\u2014Signify Health and Oak Street Health\u2014during the year, which aligns with the increased integration costs. These costs, along with other corporate charges, suggest that the short-term financial burden of integrating new assets is being absorbed by the Corporate & Other segment, potentially masking the longer-term strategic benefits these acquisitions may bring to the Health Services segment and overall business transformation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(page_196) \u2192 Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs: Discloses $487 million in such costs as part of GAAP operating income reconciliation.",

        "Hop 3: Corporate & Other \u2190 CVS(page_5): The segment is positioned as the residual category in the new operating model, absorbing integration costs from major acquisitions like Signify Health and Oak Street Health."

      "answer": "The Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division, as part of the Biopharma reportable segment, is explicitly tasked with managing the Specialty Care portfolio in the U.S., which includes inflammation & immunology, rare disease, and hospital product lines (page 10). This organizational structure indicates a strategic focus on integrating and promoting Specialty Care offerings under a unified commercial framework. The financial data from page 108 shows that Specialty Care revenues grew from $14,988 million in 2023 to $16,652 million in 2024, reflecting a 11.1% increase. This growth aligns with the strategic emphasis placed on the U.S. Commercial Division\u2019s role in driving commercial execution for these therapeutic areas. The combination of structural focus and financial performance suggests that the organizational design is contributing to the revenue momentum in Specialty Care, particularly in high-impact products like Vyndaqel family, which grew from $3,321 million in 2023 to $5,451 million in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the growth in CVS's Health Care Benefits segment assets from $44.2 billion in 2022 to $46.6 billion in 2023 align with the company's Adjusted Operating Income performance, especially considering the Health Care Benefits segment's contribution of $5.1 billion in 2021 and the overall Adjusted Operating Income trend showing a decline from $18.0 billion in 2022 to $17.5 billion in 2023?",
      "answer": "CVS's Health Care Benefits segment assets increased from $44.2 billion in 2022 to $46.6 billion in 2023, reflecting a $2.4 billion growth. Despite this asset increase, the company's Adjusted Operating Income declined from $18.0 billion in 2022 to $17.5 billion in 2023. This is notable because the Health Care Benefits segment historically contributed significantly to Adjusted Operating Income, providing $5.1 billion in 2021. The divergence suggests that while the segment expanded its asset base, broader operational or strategic factors\u2014including integration costs, restructuring charges, and litigation expenses detailed in the income reconciliation\u2014may have dampened overall profitability improvements.",

      "answer": "To assess the margin performance of the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, we calculate its segment income margin by dividing segment income by revenue: $3.358 billion / $23.041 billion = 14.6%. Comparing this to other segments: Life Sciences Solutions has a margin of $3.420 billion / $9.977 billion = 34.3%, Analytical Instruments has $1.908 billion / $7.263 billion = 26.3%, and Specialty Diagnostics has $1.124 billion / $4.405 billion = 25.5%. Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services has the lowest margin among the segments, suggesting it operates with a significantly higher cost structure relative to revenue. This indicates that the segment may be more capital-intensive or have higher operating expenses, as also evidenced by its depreciation expense of $669 million in 2023, the highest among all segments.",

      "question": "Given the decline in Life Sciences Solutions segment revenue from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023, how does this affect the contribution of this segment to the increase in consolidated depreciation, which rose from $986 million in 2022 to $1,068 million in 2023?",
      "answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment experienced a significant revenue decline from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023, suggesting a reduction in operational scale or investment. Despite this, the segment's depreciation increased slightly from $214 million to $220 million. This modest rise in depreciation, in the context of declining revenues, indicates that the segment may have maintained or even increased its capital asset base despite lower revenue generation. As a result, Life Sciences Solutions contributed more proportionally to the overall increase in consolidated depreciation, which rose from $986 million to $1,068 million in 2023, even though its revenue contribution to the company decreased.",

      "answer": "The internal transfer of Acelis Connected Health from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices added $115 million in sales from 2022 and $118 million from 2021 to the Medical Devices segment, contributing to its overall growth metrics. This realignment supports Abbott's strategic emphasis in 2024 on growing recently launched products and expanding its market position in medical devices, particularly through connected health innovations such as those from Bigfoot Biomedical and CSI's atherectomy system. The reclassification aligns with Abbott's forward-looking strategy to consolidate and grow its medical device offerings, indicating a deliberate shift to strengthen this segment as a core growth driver.",

      "question": "Given Optum Rx's role in pharmacy care services as described in the segment overview, how does its contribution to earnings from operations in 2023 reflect its operational efficiency compared to other Optum business units?",
      "answer": "Optum Rx contributed $5,115 million to earnings from operations in 2023, with an operating margin of 4.4%, which remained flat compared to 2022. This contrasts with Optum Health, which had a 6.9% operating margin, and Optum Insight, which reported a significantly higher 22.5% operating margin. Despite Optum Rx's substantial revenue growth of $16,314 million (16% increase), its lower operating margin suggests that it operates in a more cost-intensive segment of the Optum business, reflecting the nature of its pharmacy care services as described in the segment overview, which emphasize clinical integration and digital pharmacy infrastructure development.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment reported an adjusted operating income of $7,260 million in 2021, which represents a significant portion of the consolidated GAAP operating income of $13,310 million. However, when considering the nature of adjustments disclosed\u2014such as amortization, restructuring charges, and litigation costs\u2014it becomes evident that the segment's adjusted operating income is more stable and less impacted by one-time or non-operational charges compared to the consolidated figures. This indicates that the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment serves as a core, financially stable contributor to CVS's overall performance, even after accounting for broader corporate adjustments.",

      "question": "How does the 18% global sales growth of Keytruda in 2024 reconcile with the broader context of Merck's 7% total revenue growth, particularly considering the role of inflation-related price increases in offsetting foreign exchange impacts?",
      "answer": "The 18% global sales growth of Keytruda in 2024 significantly outperformed Merck's overall revenue growth of 7%, indicating Keytruda's critical role in driving the company's top-line performance. This growth was partly supported by inflation-related price increases, especially in Argentina, where the devaluation of the peso negatively impacted foreign exchange. These price increases helped offset the exchange rate effects and contributed to sustaining Keytruda's strong revenue trajectory. While Keytruda alone accounted for $29.5 billion of Merck\u2019s $64.2 billion in total sales, its outsized growth underscores its strategic importance within the oncology franchise and overall revenue base.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MRK](page_3) \u2192 [Keytruda Sales]: Keytruda sales are reported at $29,482 million in 2024, showing 18% growth from $25,011 million in 2023 and representing nearly half of the company's pharmaceutical revenue.",
        "Hop 2: [Keytruda Sales] \u2192 [Inflation-Related Price Increases]: The 18% growth in Keytruda sales is attributed in part to higher pricing, including inflation-related price increases in markets like Argentina that offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.",
        "Hop 3: [Inflation-Related Price Increases] \u2190 [MRK](page_52): The broader 7% total revenue growth for Merck is explained by oncology sales growth, particularly Keytruda and Welireg, with inflation-related pricing adjustments playing a key role in mitigating FX headwinds, especially from the Argentine peso devaluation."

The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

      "answer": "JNJ's 2023 10-K shows that MedTech had $74.7 billion in identifiable assets in 2023, up from $70.9 billion in 2022, and reported $4.669 billion in pre-tax income. This represents a return on assets of approximately 6.3%. In contrast, the Innovative Medicine segment had $58.3 billion in identifiable assets and generated $18.246 billion in pre-tax income, reflecting a significantly higher return on assets of around 31.3%. Despite MedTech's strategic focus on less invasive treatments and its asset growth, the segment's profitability relative to asset base lags behind Innovative Medicine. This suggests that while JNJ is investing more capital in MedTech, the segment is currently generating lower returns compared to the pharmaceutical-focused business, which may reflect longer R&D cycles or capital-intensive manufacturing in medical devices.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson incurred a $319 million pre-tax restructuring expense in fiscal 2023 specifically within the MedTech segment as part of a broader restructuring program to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines, and distribution arrangements. Despite this significant restructuring cost, the company also reported 'leveraging in selling and marketing expenses' across both the Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments, which contributed to improved income before tax as a percent of sales. This efficiency in Selling and Marketing expenses, noted in the segment performance analysis, was a key offsetting factor against restructuring costs and was driven by strategic cost management efforts. The broader context on page 36 confirms that leveraging in these expenses was a key driver of the slight decrease in overall Selling, Marketing and Administrative costs as a percent of sales, suggesting that the restructuring efforts were aligned with a strategic push to enhance cost efficiency in commercial operations.",

      "answer": "The Intersegment Eliminations of $46,241 million in segment revenues (from page 133) are fully removed to avoid double-counting in consolidated revenue. This adjustment is also reflected in the reconciliation of segment revenues to consolidated totals (page 194), where Intersegment Eliminations reduce total revenues from $292,111 million (as previously reported) to the same amount as adjusted, confirming their role in aligning segment-level reporting with consolidated GAAP. However, in the Adjusted Operating Income reconciliation (page 196), Intersegment Eliminations do not appear as a direct adjustment, indicating that while they affect revenue recognition at the segment level, they are not treated as an operational adjustment in the operating income metric. This distinction shows that Intersegment Eliminations are critical for revenue accuracy across segments but are not considered a reconciling item that impacts operating performance metrics.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group reported earnings from operations of $32.3 billion in 2024, a slight decrease from $32.4 billion in 2023. However, Optum's earnings from operations increased, driven by growth at Optum Health and Optum Rx, despite declines at Optum Insight. This growth in Optum's earnings enabled Optum to contribute $19.3 billion in dividends to the parent company in 2024, illustrating that while consolidated earnings remained flat, Optum's strong operational performance was a key financial pillar supporting the broader UnitedHealth Group. This dynamic highlights how Optum's internal profitability helped sustain high levels of capital return to the parent company despite broader earnings pressures.",

For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 'Business - G overnment Regulation' and Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nMedicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend. The Advance Notice for 2026 rates proposes an industry base rate increase also well short of forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient's health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\n\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n## SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\n\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023 and other financial results.\n\n- Consolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%.\n- UnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in commercial offerings, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations.\n- Earnings from operations of $32.3 billion compared to $32.4 billion last year.\n- Diluted earnings per common share was $15.51, impacted by the loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale.\n- Cash flows from operations were $24.2 billion.",

Earnings from operations increased with growth at Optum Health and Optum Rx, partially offset by decreased earnings from operations at Optum Insight. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements. Earnings from operations increased due to gains related to business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, increased investment income and cost management initiatives, partially offset by Medicare Advantage funding reductions, costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements and medical care activity.

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's consolidated operating margin declined from 8.7% in 2023 to 8.1% in 2024, driven in part by a drop in Optum's operating margin from 7.0% to 6.6%.

This margin compression at Optum directly contributed to the overall decline in the company's consolidated operating margin.

      "question": "Given the Pharmaceutical segment's 22.8% revenue contribution in 2021 and the inclusion of $0.6 billion in divestiture gains within that segment, how does this combination of operational performance and non-operational financial activity reflect on JNJ's strategic focus and capital management priorities for its pharmaceutical business?",
      "answer": "The Pharmaceutical segment contributed 22.8% of JNJ\u2019s total sales in 2021, indicating strong operational performance. Additionally, the segment reported $0.6 billion in divestiture gains, suggesting asset sales or exits were part of the financial activity within the year. While the revenue growth highlights the segment's ongoing importance to JNJ\u2019s top line, the divestiture gains may signal strategic realignment\u2014potentially shedding non-core assets to focus on priority therapeutic areas or to fund innovation. This dual dynamic reflects a capital management approach that balances growth through core operations with selective divestitures to optimize the portfolio. However, the evidence does not explicitly state the intent behind the divestitures, so any interpretation of strategic direction is inferred from typical corporate behavior.",

      "question": "Given the over 100% increase in global Otezla sales in 2021 despite lower net selling prices, and Amgen's expectation of continued pricing pressures in 2022 including a projected decline in net selling price for ENBREL, how does Amgen's immunology portfolio strategy account for these dual pricing dynamics across Otezla and ENBREL to sustain revenue growth?",
      "answer": "Amgen's immunology portfolio faces dual pricing pressures: Otezla experienced a 'change in excess of 100%' in sales for 2021, driven by unit demand but partially offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable inventory changes. Meanwhile, ENBREL is expected to see a further decline in net selling price in 2022, compounding existing pressures from lower unit demand and inventory shifts. Both products are impacted by U.S. patient dynamics tied to benefit plan changes, insurance reverification, and deductible cycles. To sustain revenue growth, Amgen must balance volume gains in Otezla with pricing erosion across both products. While the filing does not explicitly outline a mitigation strategy, the repeated reference to predictable quarterly demand patterns suggests Amgen may be relying on demand forecasting and patient support programs to stabilize net revenue flows despite pricing headwinds.",

      "answer": "The Health Services segment contributed $7,312 million to CVS's Adjusted Operating Income in 2023, making it the largest contributor among segments. At the same time, the segment saw a significant capital investment increase of $10,342 million through acquisitions in 2023, compared to no such investment in 2022. This alignment between strong adjusted operating income and substantial capital infusion suggests that Health Services is a key strategic growth engine for CVS, warranting both operational focus and financial investment.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment's adjusted operating income increased by $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and increased contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy. However, this growth occurred alongside the Health Care Benefits segment maintaining a stable balance of $45,130 million from 2020 to 2021, despite a divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business in 2020 and no impairment charges in that segment. The lack of impairment in Health Care Benefits contrasts with the strategic adjustments in other segments, suggesting a relative stability in the Health Care Benefits business even as other areas faced restructuring or market pressures. This implies that while the Pharmacy Services segment was experiencing strong operating growth, the Health Care Benefits segment remained a financially stable component of the company\u2019s overall portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "Given that the Animal Health segment's profitability has fluctuated between $1.737 billion in 2023 and $1.938 billion in 2024, how does Merck's risk disclosure around the Bravecto product, which accounted for 19% of Animal Health sales in 2024, influence the sensitivity of the segment's profitability to a potential negative event affecting that product?",
      "answer": "The Animal Health segment's profits increased from $1.737 billion in 2023 to $1.938 billion in 2024, indicating a relatively small but growing contribution to Merck\u2019s overall profitability. However, the segment's 2024 sales included $1.1 billion in revenue from Bravecto, representing 19% of total Animal Health sales. Given this significant revenue concentration, a negative event affecting Bravecto\u2014such as a product recall, regulatory issue, or loss of market confidence\u2014could disproportionately impact the Animal Health segment's profitability. This sensitivity is explicitly highlighted in the risk factors section, which states that any negative event involving Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Animal Health business, especially as the segment becomes more significant to Merck\u2019s overall operations.",

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "answer": "JNJ reported a 25.4% increase in MedTech R&D spending from $2,493 million in 2022 to $3,122 million in 2023, signaling a strategic emphasis on innovation within the segment. Correspondingly, the company invested $2,372 million in Property, Plant & Equipment for MedTech in 2023, a 11.9% increase from $2,120 million in the prior year. This capital investment aligns with the segment\u2019s growth strategy, though the percentage increase in R&D outpaces that of capital additions, suggesting a more aggressive push in innovation spending relative to infrastructure.

      "question": "How does the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment's competitive success, which depends on maintaining relationships with PBMs and payors, align with the reported increase in the generic dispensing rate to 88.9% in 2024, and what does this suggest about the segment's ability to manage prescription volume growth and maintain operating income in a competitive market?",
      "answer": "The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment's competitive success is tied to maintaining contractual relationships with PBMs and payors, as noted in the risk factors section. Despite competitive pressures, the segment achieved an increase in the generic dispensing rate to 88.9% in 2024, up from 88.4% in the prior year, indicating improved efficiency in promoting cost-effective generic drug utilization. This aligns with the segment's ability to manage prescription volume growth of 4.0% in 2024, which supports revenue stability and operating income of $4.77 billion. The increase in generic dispensing suggests that the segment is effectively navigating its competitive environment by leveraging cost-saving measures, which may help offset pricing pressures and support profitability.",

        "Hop 2: [Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness] \u2192 [Generic Dispensing Rate]: The segment's generic dispensing rate increased to 88.9% in 2024, driven by new generic drug introductions and member encouragement to use generics.",

          "chunk_text": "- By affecting our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms and our ability to execute sale-leaseback transactions under acceptable terms.\n- By weakening the ability of our former subsidiaries and/or their purchasers to satisfy their lease obligations that we have guaranteed and causing the Company to be required to satisfy those obligations.\n- By weakening the financial condition of other insurers, including long-term care insurers and life insurers, which increases the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers to policyholders and claimants.\n- By continuing to cause inflation that could cause interest rates to further increase and thereby further increase our interest ex pense and reduce our operating results, as well as further decrease the value of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio, which would further reduce our operating results and/or adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n## Each of our segments operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment; and operating income in the industries in which we compete may decline.\n\nEach of our segments, Health Care Benefits, Health Services, which includes our PBM business, and Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness, operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment. Specifically:\n\n- As competition increases in the geographies in which we operate, including competition from new entrants, a significant increase in price compression and/or reimbursement pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.\n- In our Health Care Benefits segment, we must often bid against our competitors in a highly competitive environment to acquire and retain our government customers' business. Winning bids for Medicaid and dual eligible programs often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidders, and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency. CMS has proposed requiring that health plans offering certain dual eligible programs must also offer Medicaid programs, which has resulted in the Company refraining from bidding in certain jurisdictions and could further impact the Company's ability to obtain or retain membership in its dual eligible programs.\n- In our Health Care Benefits segment, our customers have considerable flexibility in moving between us and our competitors. We may lose members to competitors with more favorable pricing, or our customers may purchase different types of products from us that are less profitable, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results. In addition, our Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and CHIP products may be subject to termination without cause, periodic re-bid, rate adjustment and program redesign, as customers seek to contain their benefit costs, particularly in an uncertain economy. These actions may adversely affect our membership, revenues and operating results.\n- We requested increases in our premium rates in our Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2025 and expect to request future increases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant assessments, fees and taxes imposed by federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA. Our rates also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our products will be selected by people with a higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participants we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable products (also known as 'adverse selection'), particularly in small group Commercial products. These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\n- The competitive success of our Health Services segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies.\n- The competitive success of our Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment and our specialty pharmacy operations is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms as the payors' clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.\n- In our PBM business, we maintain contractual relationships with brand name drug manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer's rebates often depend on a PBM's ability to meet contractual requirements, including the placement of a manufacturer's products on the PBM's formularies. If we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates provided by drug manufacturers decline, our operating results, cash flows and/or prospects could be adversely affected.\n- If laws or regulations are promulgated that limit the number of PBMs available in a particular business or geography, competition in those businesses and geographies could be amplified and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "Given JNJ's significant increase in capital expenditures for MedTech over the past three years, how does the company's strategic emphasis on MedTech as a standalone reportable segment align with its allocation of capital resources through additions to property, plant, and equipment?",
      "answer": "JNJ has increased its capital expenditures for the MedTech segment from $2,120 million in 2022 to $2,443 million in 2024, reflecting a consistent upward trend in investment. This aligns with the company's strategic reorganization in 2023, which separated the Consumer Health business and positioned MedTech as one of only two reportable segments. The elevation of MedTech to a reportable segment, alongside Innovative Medicine, indicates a strategic shift toward prioritizing this business line, which is mirrored in the growing capital investments in infrastructure and production capabilities for MedTech. The increase in additions to property, plant, and equipment for MedTech outpaces that of Innovative Medicine, signaling a stronger capital commitment to scaling MedTech operations post-reorganization.",

      "answer": "The decline from 91% to 88% of Medicare Advantage members in plans rated 4.0 stars or higher suggests a reduction in the proportion of members eligible for CMS bonus payments in 2026, which could negatively impact the Health Care Benefits segment's revenue. Since bonus payments are tied to plan quality ratings and a larger portion of members were in lower-rated plans in 2025, this may result in lower incremental revenue from bonuses compared to the prior year. This occurs against a backdrop of a projected 0.16% industry-wide revenue decrease for Medicare Advantage plans in 2025, further constraining potential upside. The combination of lower star rating coverage and flat reimbursement rates may pressure segment profitability unless offset by operational improvements or cost containment measures.",

          "chunk_text": "Health Care Benefits products are sold through: the Company's sales personnel; independent brokers, agents and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business; as well as private health insurance exchanges ('Private Exchanges') and Public Exchanges (together with Private Exchanges, 'Insurance Exchanges'). For large employers or other entities that sponsor the Company's products ('plan sponsors'), independent consultants and brokers are frequently involved in employer health plan selection decisions and sales. In some instances, the Company may pay commissions, fees and other amounts to brokers, agents, consultants and sales representatives who place business with the Company. In certain cases, the customer pays the broker for services rendered, and the Company may facilitate that arrangement by collecting the funds from the customer and transmitting them to the broker. The Company supports marketing and sales efforts with an advertising program that may include television, radio, billboards, print media and social media, supplemented by market research and direct marketing efforts.\n\nThe U.S. federal government is a significant customer of the Health Care Benefits segment through contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals and federal employee-related benefit programs. Other than the contracts with CMS, the Health Care Benefits segment is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a significant effect on the earnings of the segment. The loss of business from any one or a few independent brokers or agents would not have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the Health Care Benefits segment. Health Care Benefits segment revenues from the federal government accounted for 18% of the Company's consolidated total revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals in the Health Care Benefits segment accounted for approximately 74%, 73% and 74%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenues from the federal government in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Pricing\n\nFor Commercial Insured plans, contracts containing the pricing and other terms of the relationship are generally established in advance of the policy period and typically have a duration of one year. Fees under ASC plans are generally fixed for a period of one year.\n\nGenerally, a fix ed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period for Commercial Insured plans. The Company typically cannot recover unanticipated increases in health care and other benefit costs in the current policy period; however, it may consider prior experience for a product in the aggregate or for a specific customer, among other factors, in determining premium rates for future policy periods. Where required by state laws, premium rates are filed and approved by state regulators prior to contract inception. Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.\n\nThe Company has Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or 'capitation') payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fix ed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit the Company's exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to the Company for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantage products and all PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases, these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and higher health care and other benefit costs.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 'ACA') ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's 'star ratings.' Plans must have a star rating of 4 or higher (out of 5) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company's 2025 star ratings in October 2024. The Company's 2025 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company's Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2026. Based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2024, 88% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2025 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 91% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2023.",

      "answer": "The Consumer Wellness segment generated $124,500 million in total revenues and $5,774 million in adjusted operating income in 2024, indicating a relatively modest profit margin. This aligns with the challenges described in the operating results, where front store sales declined 2.1% due to reduced consumer demand and the absence of significant contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits. Additionally, pharmacy reimbursement pressure continued to negatively impact profitability, despite increased prescription volume driven by vaccinations and branded GLP-1 drugs. The adjusted operating income reflects these dual pressures\u2014gains from higher prescription volume and improved drug purchasing were largely offset by reimbursement challenges and front store volume declines.

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How does the Health Care Benefits segment's exposure to adverse selection and product mix risk on Public Exchanges relate to the uncertainty in estimating health care costs payable, particularly given the sensitivity of IBNR reserves to completion factors and cost trends?",
      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment faces competitive and pricing risks on Public Exchanges, where adverse selection could lead to a disproportionate number of high-cost members, negatively affecting profitability. This risk is compounded by shifts in product mix, as movement toward less profitable products like ASC or government-sponsored plans could materially impact operating results. These risks feed directly into the estimation of health care costs payable, which includes incurred but not reported (IBNR) liabilities. The segment observed a 4 basis point increase in completion factors in 2023, which reduced health care costs payable by $55 million. However, a potential variation of \u00b19 basis points could impact reserves by \u00b1$166 million. The audited valuation of these liabilities, as detailed on page 200, highlights the sensitivity of IBNR estimates to assumptions about completion factors and health care cost trends, reinforcing how initial pricing and enrollment assumptions on Public Exchanges can significantly affect the ultimate financial exposure and the need for actuarial precision in reserving.",

        "Hop 3: Health Care Costs Payable \u2190 CVS(page_200): The audit section confirms the high degree of subjectivity in estimating IBNR reserves, noting that assumptions about completion factors and cost trends significantly affect the valuation, and that a \u00b19 basis point variation could impact reserves by \u00b1$166 million."

      "answer": "The R&D investment in the Innovative Medicine segment remained high at $11,963 million, or 21.8% of segment sales in 2023, signaling a strong focus on innovation and product development. This segment also saw a significant increase in capital expenditures, with Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment rising by 20.1% year-over-year to $1,653 million in 2023. This increase suggests that J&J is not only investing in R&D for new product pipelines but is also expanding its manufacturing and operational capacity to support future growth. The capital allocation strategy appears aligned with scaling production capabilities in anticipation of bringing new products to market, reinforcing the long-term strategic importance of the Innovative Medicine segment.",

      "question": "How does UNH's segment-level operating margin performance for Optum in 2021 align with the consolidated operating margin decline reported in the income statement, and what does this imply about the relative contribution of Optum versus other business units?",
      "answer": "UNH's Optum segment reported an operating margin of 7.7% in 2021, which was lower than its 2020 margin of 7.4%, indicating a slight decline. However, the consolidated operating margin for UNH declined more significantly from 8.7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021. This suggests that while Optum's margin contraction contributed to the overall decline, other segments\u2014particularly UnitedHealthcare, which saw a more pronounced drop from 6.2% to 5.4%\u2014played a larger role in the consolidated margin decline. Therefore, the decline in the overall operating margin appears to be more heavily influenced by performance in the UnitedHealthcare segment than in Optum.",

        "Hop 1: UNH(page_34) \u2192 Optum: Optum's operating margin decreased slightly from 7.4% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2021 (despite an increase in operating earnings from $10,046M to $11,995M).",
        "Hop 2: Optum \u2192 Operating margin: Optum's margin performance shows a marginal improvement in 2021, which does not align with a significant downward trend in the overall company margin.",
        "Hop 3: Operating margin \u2190 UNH(page_33): The consolidated operating margin for UNH declined from 8.7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021, indicating broader margin pressure across the company."

      "question": "How does the growth in Life Sciences Solutions segment income compare to its depreciation expense trends, and what might this indicate about Thermo Fisher Scientific's capital investment efficiency in this segment?",
      "answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment income grew significantly from $2,446 million in 2019 to $7,817 million in 2021, while its depreciation expense increased more modestly from $130 million to $197 million over the same period. This suggests that the segment's profitability is growing faster than its capital expenditures, potentially indicating improving capital efficiency. This pattern implies that Thermo Fisher Scientific may be deriving increasing returns from its existing asset base within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, although the filing does not explicitly state this interpretation.",

      "answer": "The Diagnostics segment's operating profit declined from $3,436 million in 2022 to $2,406 million in 2023, as disclosed in the operating profit section on page 80. Despite this drop, the Diagnostics segment's goodwill balance increased from $6,875 million at the end of 2022 to $6,910 million by the end of 2023, as shown in the goodwill table on page 88. This apparent contradiction may be explained by the company's 2023 acquisitions and adjustments, which added $13 million to the Diagnostics segment's goodwill, even as operating performance declined. The increase in goodwill suggests continued strategic investment in the segment despite short-term profitability challenges.",

        "Hop 1: DHR(page_80) \u2192 D&A (FIN_METRIC): The Diagnostics segment's operating profit is disclosed as declining from $3,436 million in 2022 to $2,406 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: D&A (FIN_METRIC) \u2192 Diagnostics Segment (SEGMENT): The operating profit metric is directly tied to the performance of the Diagnostics segment, which is separately itemized in the financial table.",

      "answer": "Medtronic's Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division (page 7) highlights AI-enabled remote monitoring capabilities through products like the Azure MRI SureScan pacemaker with BlueSync technology and the Reveal LINQ II insertable cardiac monitor with AccuRhythm AI algorithms, which are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce clinic workload. This strategic focus on AI and remote monitoring is part of the broader Cardiovascular Portfolio (as noted on page 6), which includes Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure as one of its core divisions. The segment reporting on page 103 confirms the ongoing structural integrity of the Cardiovascular Portfolio as a key reportable segment, with no changes to its composition during FY2024, and emphasizes its role in delivering device-based therapies for cardiac and vascular disorders. However, the segment also faces financial risk exposure due to unresolved tax matters and indemnification guarantees that could materially affect consolidated earnings. Therefore, while the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division advances AI-driven innovation, the broader Cardiovascular Portfolio operates under financial uncertainties that could constrain its long-term strategic execution.",

Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS have reached agreement on all significant issues except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court matter for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n\nMedtronic, Inc.'s fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax  returns are currently being audited by the IRS.\n\nCovidien LP (a wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc) has either reached agreement with the IRS or the statute of limitations has lapsed on its U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal year 2020.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\nRefer to Note 13 for additional discussion of income taxes.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates' products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers  warranties  on  various  products.  The  Company's  maximum  exposure  under  these  guarantees  is  unable  to  be  estimated.  Historically,  the  Company  has  not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.\n\nThe Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\n## 19. Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThere were no changes to the reportable segments during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. We continue to have four reportable segments: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit. However, there were changes to the operating segments during fiscal year 2024 as a result of how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses business performance. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Medical Surgical Portfolio was separated into two operating segments as a result of the previously contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses, which were previously aggregated based upon similar economic and operating characteristics. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, there were certain Medical Surgical businesses that were moved to the Other line, which primarily related to wind-down activity of the Company's Renal Care Solutions business that was contributed to Mozarc Medical in April 2023. Subsequently, as a result of the February 2024 decision to exit the Company's ventilator product line and retain and combine the remaining PMRI businesses into one business unit as further discussed in Note 3, the two operating segments within the Medical Surgical Portfolio were combined into one operating segment, and the Company's ventilator product line, which was in the Medical Surgical Portfolio, was moved to the Other line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The four principal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Cardiovascular Portfolio segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart and vascular-related disorders and diseases.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Neuroscience Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Medical Surgical Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, obesity, and other preventable complications.",

      "question": "How does JNJ's $0.9 billion in-process R&D expense in Pharmaceuticals compare to its $0.9 billion in-process R&D expense in Medical Devices, given the differing financial performance and strategic positioning of the two segments?",
      "answer": "JNJ reported a $0.9 billion in-process R&D expense in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments. However, the Pharmaceutical segment had significantly higher pre-tax income ($18.181 billion in 2021) compared to Medical Devices ($4.373 billion in 2021), suggesting that the larger financial capacity of Pharmaceuticals may support riskier or more expensive R&D investments. Despite this, the identical R&D spend amount across segments could indicate a balanced innovation strategy, though the Medical Devices segment\u2019s lower profitability might make its R&D investment relatively more impactful or strategically riskier.",

      "answer": "The reduction in identifiable assets for the Consumer Health segment from $27,355 million in 2020 to $25,081 million in 2021 suggests a de-investment or repositioning of the segment ahead of the announced spin-off in November 2021. This aligns with the strategic decision to separate the Consumer Health business, indicating that JNJ began adjusting the segment's asset base in preparation for its eventual standalone status.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have",

      "answer": "The Medical Devices segment reported R&D expenses of $2,174 million in 2020 and $2,377 million in 2021, reflecting a 9.3% increase. However, its income before tax dropped from $7,286 million in 2019 to $3,044 million in 2020, a decline of 58.1%. This suggests that despite increased investment in R&D, the segment experienced significant financial pressure, potentially due to external factors such as market demand shifts, regulatory challenges, or operational inefficiencies. The sharp decline in profitability relative to R&D outlay raises concerns about the segment's ability to convert innovation investments into stable earnings, indicating potential vulnerabilities in both ROI and financial resilience.",

      "answer": "The sharp decline in curtailments and settlements from $93 million in 2023 to only $2 million in 2024 suggests that J&J significantly reduced its restructuring or pension-related exit activities year-over-year. This indicates a stabilization in their workforce and benefit plan structure. Simultaneously, the company's continued disclosure of fair value measurements for retirement plan assets on page 82 highlights an ongoing focus on asset valuation transparency and risk management. Together, these signals suggest a shift toward maintaining current pension obligations with greater predictability and less reliance on plan modifications or settlements, reflecting a more stable and measured pension strategy in 2024.",

      "answer": "The Health Care Benefits segment expressed concern about adverse selection and shifts in product mix toward less profitable offerings, such as government-sponsored programs, which could materially affect operating results. In 2023, the segment observed a $55 million decrease in health care costs payable due to higher-than-expected completion factors, indicating that claims were settling faster than anticipated. This adjustment suggests a potential improvement in cost control or claim forecasting, which could mitigate some of the profitability risks from adverse selection. However, the auditor highlighted the sensitivity of IBNR estimates to assumptions like completion factors and cost trends, noting that a 9 basis point variance could affect liabilities by approximately $166 million. This implies that while current adjustments may support profitability, the inherent uncertainty in estimating future claims could reintroduce risk, especially if underlying assumptions shift due to external factors like regulatory changes or market dynamics.",

      "answer": "The increase in the generic dispensing rate to 88.9% in 2024 reflects the effectiveness of the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment\u2019s initiatives to promote generic drug usage, which likely contributes to cost savings and improved profitability. This aligns with the segment\u2019s strategic evaluation based on adjusted operating income, a metric used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources. Despite this positive operational metric, the segment must still navigate risks such as legal proceedings and industry-specific challenges, as noted in the risk factors, which could impact its overall performance and resource allocation decisions.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "question": "Given that Optum Insight is a reportable segment of UNH focused on analytics and technology solutions, how does its 19% year-over-year increase in earnings from operations compare with its contribution to consolidated revenues, and what does this suggest about its profitability relative to other Optum segments?",
      "answer": "Optum Insight, as a reportable segment of UnitedHealth Group, contributed $18.9 billion in revenues in 2023, representing a 30% increase from 2022. Its earnings from operations rose by 19%, from $3.588 billion in 2022 to $4.268 billion in 2023. This indicates that while Optum Insight's revenue growth was strong, its operating margin (22.5% in 2023) declined slightly compared to the prior year (24.6%). In the broader Optum business, which includes Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx, the total earnings from operations increased by 13% in 2023. This suggests that Optum Insight remains one of the more profitable segments within Optum, maintaining a significantly higher operating margin than Optum Health (6.9%) and Optum Rx (4.4%) despite a slight margin compression.",

      "answer": "Over the past three years, the Established Pharmaceuticals segment saw additions to property and equipment of $183 million in 2024, $185 million in 2023, and $175 million in 2022, indicating a relatively stable level of capital investment. During the same period, the segment's operating earnings increased from $1,049 million in 2022 to $1,206 million in 2023 and further to $1,233 million in 2024. This suggests that the consistent capital investment in the segment has contributed to improving operating earnings, reflecting a positive alignment between capital allocation and financial performance.",

      "answer": "The 1.9% increase in J&J's 2023 international sales (from $38.0 billion in 2022 to $38.7 billion in 2023) reflects operational growth that was partially offset by negative currency impacts. Specifically, the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a 5.6% negative currency impact, while international sales overall faced a 1.3% negative currency impact. This indicates that despite strong regional operational performance (e.g., 9.5% operational growth in Asia-Pacific, Africa), the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced the reported sales value when converted from local currencies. The reconciliation shows that currency fluctuations significantly dampened the growth that was otherwise achieved operationally in international markets.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment experienced a $189 million (3.2%) decline in adjusted operating income in 2024, primarily driven by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, including lower contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. Meanwhile, the Corporate & Other segment reported a $1,348 million adjusted operating loss in 2024, a slight increase from the $1,318 million loss in 2023. Despite these financial challenges, the CEO continues to use adjusted operating income as the principal measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, as outlined in the segment reporting section. This suggests that the company is maintaining its strategic focus on adjusted operating income as a core metric for decision-making, even in the face of declining profitability in key segments.

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "question": "Given the 7% year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments segment from 2022 to 2023, how does the 11% increase in the company's consolidated depreciation expense in 2023 reflect the capital intensity of sustaining this growth?",
      "answer": "The Analytical Instruments segment grew its revenue by 7% in 2023 compared to 2022, from $6,624 million to $7,263 million. This growth coincided with an increase in the segment\u2019s depreciation expense from $83 million to $93 million, indicating increased capital investment. On a consolidated basis, the company\u2019s depreciation expense rose by 8.3% to $1,068 million in 2023, outpacing the overall revenue decline of 4.6% for the company. This suggests that the company is investing heavily in fixed assets, particularly in segments like Analytical Instruments, which may be critical to maintaining or growing revenues despite broader market challenges.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy Services segment's cost structure for prescription drugs sold through retail networks includes the cost of drugs, net of volume-related discounts, and retail co-payments, which totaled $11.6 billion in 2021. This cost base is directly tied to the segment\u2019s Adjusted Operating Income, which increased by $1.2 billion (20.6%) in 2021, driven by improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy contributions. However, this growth was partially offset by continued price compression and competitive pressures in the PBM industry that have forced CVS to share a larger portion of rebates, fees, and discounts with clients. These pressures, combined with limitations on using retail network 'differential' or 'spread' pricing due to regulatory and market dynamics, constrain the segment\u2019s ability to maintain higher margins. Thus, while the cost structure reflects significant co-payment inflows and negotiated discounts, external market forces increasingly erode the segment\u2019s ability to retain those benefits in Adjusted Operating Income.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How did the Cytiva acquisition impact DHR's 2021 operating cash flows through changes in working capital requirements, particularly trade accounts payable?",
      "answer": "The Cytiva acquisition significantly influenced DHR's 2021 operating cash flows by increasing working capital requirements, especially trade accounts payable. In 2021, the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable used $564 million in operating cash flows, compared to $160 million in 2020. Specifically, Cytiva contributed $247 million to the total trade accounts payable of $250 million (as shown in the segment table), indicating that Cytiva was the dominant driver of the increase in trade accounts payable. This working capital outflow reflects the integration of Cytiva's operations, which expanded DHR's Life Sciences segment and introduced additional supply chain and operational complexity. The acquisition, which was finalized in March 2020 for $20.7 billion in cash, added substantial assets and liabilities to DHR's balance sheet, including $10,171 million of goodwill and $10,656 million of other intangible assets related to Cytiva. The resulting increase in trade accounts payable directly contributed to the larger cash outflow tied to working capital in 2021.",

These increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and accrued and prepaid expenses in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n- Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, and decreased primarily as a result of lower cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n- As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.\n\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $8.4 billion for 2021, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion, or 34%, as compared to 2020. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\n- 2021 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n- Net earnings for 2021 reflected an increase of approximately $679 million of depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense as compared to 2020. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Contract settlement expense represents the pretax charge related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the contract settlement expense. Depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and contract settlement expense are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Cash flows from the gain on sale of product lines and loss on the extinguishment of debt are reflected in cash flows from investing activities while unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the Company.\n- The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $564 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $160 million of operating cash flows used in 2020. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.\n- The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $94 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $739 million provided in 2020. The timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $13.0 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $21.2 billion of net cash used in 2020.\n\n## Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's 2021 and 2020 acquisitions and divestitures refer to '-Overview' and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2021 and 2020, the Company invested $934 million and $342 million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.",

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

      "question": "How does Merck's definition of Pharmaceutical Segment profits, which excludes human health R&D expenses, reconcile with the reported $44,533 million in 2024 segment profits, especially considering that segment profit calculations are used by the CEO for resource allocation?",
      "answer": "Merck's 2024 Pharmaceutical Segment profits are reported at $44,533 million, which is derived from segment sales less standard costs and directly incurred selling, general, and administrative expenses. However, this figure excludes human health-related R&D expenses from Merck Research Laboratories, which are not allocated to segment profits. The CEO uses these segment profits for resource allocation, primarily during planning and forecasting, despite the exclusion of significant R&D costs that are critical to long-term pharmaceutical innovation and pipeline development.",

      "answer": "UNH's investment in Optum Rx grew from $15,535 million in 2020 to $15,563 million in 2021, indicating a strategic financial commitment to the segment. During the same period, Optum Rx's operating margin increased slightly from 4.4% to 4.5%, reflecting modest profitability improvements. However, the consolidated operating margin for UNH declined from 8.7% to 8.3%, suggesting that despite Optum Rx's positive margin movement, other segments or corporate-level costs offset this gain, resulting in an overall margin contraction. This interplay reveals that Optum Rx's performance alone was not sufficient to counterbalance broader margin pressures across the enterprise.",

      "question": "How does CVS's expectation of a decreasing Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) in 2022 for the Health Care Benefits segment align with the reported increase in MBR from 80.9% to 85.0% in 2021, and what does this suggest about the segment's trajectory in managing medical cost trends?",
      "answer": "CVS anticipated a decrease in the Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) for the Health Care Benefits segment in 2022 compared to 2021, citing improved pricing and reduced medical costs related to the pandemic. However, in 2021, the MBR actually increased from 80.9% to 85.0% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher costs associated with the ongoing impact of the pandemic, including the deferral of elective procedures in 2020 and the repeal of the Health Insurance Fee (HIF). This contrast suggests that while the segment faced significant cost pressures in 2021, CVS projected a return to cost containment in 2022 as pandemic-related utilization normalized and pricing improvements took effect. The forward-looking expectation of a lower MBR indicates a strategic focus on underwriting discipline and cost management, despite recent headwinds.",

        "Hop 2: [Health Care Benefits Segment] \u2192 [MBR]: The MBR is a key performance metric for the segment, reflecting the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits, and is used to assess underwriting and business performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company's Insured Health Care Benefits products.\n- The MBR increased from 80.9% to 85.0% in 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related costs in 2021 compared to the prior year, including the impact of the deferral of elective procedures and other discretionary utilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by improved underlying performance in the current year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.\n- Operating expenses decreased $215 million, or 1.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the repeal of the HIF for 2021, partially offset by incremental operating expenses to support the growth in the Government Services business described above and the net impact of the sale of the Workers' Compensation business sold on July 31, 2020.",

      "question": "How do the revenue adjustments for pricing guarantees and gift card breakage patterns specifically contribute to the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment's $7,260 million adjusted operating income figure reported in the segment results?",
      "answer": "The $7,260 million adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment is calculated after factoring in revenue adjustments for pricing guarantees and gift card liabilities. Specifically, the segment defers revenue from gift cards as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred, recognizing breakage based on historical redemption patterns. Additionally, the segment adjusts revenues for refunds owed to third-party payers based on pricing guarantees and performance metrics. These adjustments are explicitly considered in the segment's financial reporting, as evidenced by the $1,515 million in adjustments to total revenues and the subsequent reconciliation to $7,260 million in adjusted operating income after accounting for segment-specific adjustments of $(363) million. This demonstrates how these accounting practices directly shape the reported financial performance of the segment.",

      "question": "How does the growth in Merck's international Pharmaceutical segment sales between 2022 and 2023 correlate with the increase in equity income from affiliates reported in the same period?",
      "answer": "Merck's international Pharmaceutical segment sales grew from $27,016 million in 2022 to $27,044 million in 2023, a modest increase of $28 million. During the same period, equity income from affiliates in the Pharmaceutical segment rose significantly from $39 million to $111 million. This suggests that the growth in equity income outpaced the growth in international sales, potentially indicating stronger performance from Merck's international collaborations or affiliates despite relatively flat direct international sales growth.",

        "Hop 1: MRK(page_126) \u2192 Pharmaceutical Segment: International Pharmaceutical segment sales increased slightly from $27,016 million in 2022 to $27,044 million in 2023.",

      "answer": "The $1.2 billion increase in adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy Services segment reflects strong performance driven by improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy contributions, despite price compression pressures. However, this positive performance must be viewed alongside the $1,306 million loss in the Corporate & Other segment, which absorbs integration costs and other non-operational expenses. The interdependent business model described in the segment overview highlights that the Corporate & Other segment supports cross-segment functions like integration and strategic initiatives, suggesting that some of the Pharmacy Services segment's growth may be offset by investments or inefficiencies in centralized operations. This dynamic illustrates how segment-level profitability does not fully capture the financial trade-offs across the enterprise.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "question": "Given the 12% profit growth in the Animal Health segment driven by higher sales and lower manufacturing costs, how might the concentration of 19% of segment sales in Bravecto expose Merck to disproportionate risk, especially if disease outbreaks or supply chain disruptions impact production or demand?",
      "answer": "Merck\u2019s Animal Health segment reported $5.877 billion in sales in 2024, contributing to a 12% profit increase primarily due to higher sales and reduced manufacturing costs. However, Bravecto alone accounted for $1.1 billion, or 19%, of that segment\u2019s revenue. This high concentration makes the segment particularly vulnerable to negative events affecting Bravecto, such as disease outbreaks that could reduce livestock populations or demand for animal health products. Additionally, if a highly contagious disease were to impact production sites, Merck could face manufacturing halts or increased procurement costs, which would disproportionately affect the Animal Health segment\u2019s profitability. Thus, while the segment is growing, its reliance on a single product and exposure to disease-related risks could undermine future stability.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "question": "How did the change in discount rate during 2023 impact CVS's pension obligations and what does this imply about the sensitivity of their postretirement benefit liabilities to interest rate fluctuations?",
      "answer": "The change in discount rate during 2023 was the primary driver of the change in CVS's pension benefit obligation, as stated on page 171. This reflects the sensitivity of pension liabilities to interest rate assumptions. Further, on page 112, the 'Change in discount rate on insurance reserves' was reported as -$67 million for 2023, indicating downward pressure on reserves due to lower discount rates. This aligns with the broader sensitivity of postretirement benefits to interest rate shifts, as also evidenced by the -$61 million change in pension and other postretirement benefits for 2023. Together, these figures suggest that declining discount rates increased CVS's pension liabilities and had a broader negative impact on their postretirement obligations.",

      "answer": "The Health Services segment experienced significant balance growth from $23,615 million in 2022 to $34,066 million in 2023, reflecting substantial investment and expansion. However, this growth contrasts with the minimal $5 million in Office Real Estate Optimization Charges attributed to the segment, compared to the total $46 million across all segments. This suggests that the Health Services segment was less impacted by real estate optimization efforts, which may indicate a strategic focus on maintaining or expanding physical infrastructure in this area, despite broader corporate cost-cutting initiatives.",

As  a  result  of  these  holds,  Merck  and  Gilead  made  the  decision  to  stop  all  dosing  of  participants  in  a  Phase  2  clinical  study evaluating islatravir and lenacapavir in people living with HIV who are virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. The two companies are assessing whether a different dosing of islatravir in combination with lenacapavir may provide a once-weekly oral therapy option for people living with HIV. Merck and Gilead remain committed to their collaboration.\n\nIn  January  2021,  Merck  entered  into  an  exclusive  license  and  research  collaboration  agreement  with  Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Artiva) to discover, develop and manufacture CAR-NK cells that target certain solid tumors using Artiva's proprietary platform. Merck and Artiva agreed to engage in up to three different research programs, each covering a collaboration target.  Merck  has  sole  responsibility  for  all  development  and  commercialization  activities  (including  regulatory  filing  and approval). Under the terms of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment of $30 million, which was included in Research and development expenses  in  2021,  for  license  and  other  rights  for  the  first  two  collaboration  targets  and  agreed  to  make  another upfront  payment of $15 million for license and other rights for the third collaboration target when it is selected by Merck and accepted  by  Artiva.  In  addition,  Artiva  is  eligible  to  receive  future  contingent  milestone  payments  (which  span  all  three collaboration targets), aggregating up to $217.5 million in developmental milestones, $570 million in regulatory milestones, and $1.05 billion in sales-based milestones. The agreement also provides for Merck to pay tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 14% on future sales.\n\n## 2020 Transactions\n\nIn December 2020, Merck acquired OncoImmune, a privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, for an upfront payment of $423 million. OncoImmune's lead therapeutic candidate (MK-7110) was being evaluated for the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Under the agreement, prior to the completion of the acquisition, OncoImmune spun-out certain rights and assets unrelated to the MK-7110 program to a new entity  owned  by  the  existing  shareholders  of  OncoImmune.  In  connection  with  the  closing  of  the  acquisition,  Merck  invested $50 million for a 20% ownership interest in the new entity, which was valued at $33 million resulting in a $17 million premium. Merck  also  recognized  other  net  liabilities  of  $22  million.  The  Company  recorded Research  and  development expenses  of $462 million in 2020 related to this transaction. In 2021, Merck received feedback from the FDA that additional data would be needed to support a potential Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application and therefore the Company did not expect MK-7110 would become available until the first half of 2022. Given this timeline and the technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties, the availability of a number of medicines for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the need to concentrate Merck's resources on accelerating  the  development  and  manufacture  of  the  most  viable  therapeutics  and  vaccines,  Merck  decided  to  discontinue development  of  MK-7110  for  the  treatment  of  COVID-19.  Due  to  the  discontinuation,  the  Company  recorded  charges  of $207  million  in  2021,  which  are  reflected  in Cost  of  sales and  relate  to  fixed  assets  and  materials  written  off,  as  well  as  the recognition of liabilities for purchase commitments.\n\nAlso in December 2020, Merck acquired VelosBio Inc. (VelosBio), a privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company,  for  $2.8  billion.  VelosBio's  lead  investigational  candidate  is  zilovertamab  vedotin  (MK-2140),  an  antibody-drug conjugate targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded net assets of $180 million (primarily cash) and Research and development expenses of $2.7 billion in 2020 related to the transaction.  During  2021,  the  Company  recorded  adjustments  to  these  amounts  which  resulted  in  a  reduction  of Research  and development expenses of $43 million, an increase to total consideration paid of $47 million, and an increase to net assets recorded of $90 million.\n\nIn  September  2020,  Merck  and  Seagen  Inc.  (Seagen)  announced  an  oncology  collaboration  to  globally  develop  and commercialize Seagen's ladiratuzumab vedotin (MK-6440), an investigational antibody-drug conjugate targeting LIV-1, which is currently  in  Phase  2  clinical  trials.  The  collaboration  will  pursue  a  broad  joint  development  program  evaluating  ladiratuzumab vedotin as monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptorpositive breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors. The companies will equally share profits worldwide. Under the terms of the agreement,",

      "question": "How does UnitedHealth Group's reliance on Optum Health's value-based care arrangements, which assume responsibility for healthcare costs in exchange for monthly premiums, reconcile with the parent company's increasing dividends received from subsidiaries, including Optum, that totaled $19.3 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group receives significant dividends from its subsidiaries, including Optum, which totaled $19.3 billion in 2024 (page 81), indicating strong financial returns from its business segments. Optum Health, a key segment of Optum, operates under value-based care models where it assumes responsibility for healthcare costs in exchange for monthly premiums, which constitute nearly 80% of UnitedHealth\u2019s total consolidated revenues (page 12). However, this model carries risk, as Optum Health must accurately predict and manage medical costs to maintain profitability, with any overruns potentially impacting financial results (page 12). The increasing dividends suggest that despite these risks, Optum Health and other subsidiaries are generating sufficient earnings to support substantial capital returns to the parent company. This implies strong operational performance and effective cost management within Optum Health, even as it navigates the inherent uncertainties of value-based care arrangements.",

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "answer": "CVS achieved a 20.6% increase in adjusted operating income, reaching $17.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, despite facing industry-wide price compression and a $135 million reduction in losses from the Corporate & Other segment. This growth was primarily driven by the Pharmacy Services segment, which benefited from improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. These gains were partially offset by continued price compression in the PBM industry, where competitive pressures and regulatory changes limited the ability to retain rebates and pricing differentials. Meanwhile, the Corporate & Other segment improved its adjusted operating loss from $(1,606) million to $(1,471) million, contributing to the overall financial improvement. The combination of strategic cost management, operational efficiencies, and growth in high-margin services within the Pharmacy Services segment enabled the company to overcome these challenges and deliver strong adjusted operating income growth.",

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year.

The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers.

The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "Given the significant year-over-year increase in Pharmaceutical segment R&D spending in 2021, how does the corresponding increase in Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment for the same segment compare to its overall capital investment trends across recent years?",
      "answer": "The Pharmaceutical segment reported a 21.0% increase in R&D spending in 2021 compared to 2020. This aligns with a rise in Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment, which increased from $863 million in 2020 to $1,198 million in 2021\u2014a 39.0% increase. This indicates that the segment not only increased investment in R&D but also significantly expanded its capital infrastructure in 2021, suggesting a strategic push to scale operations in alignment with innovation efforts.",

      "question": "How does the Animal Health segment's $1.938 billion in 2024 segment profits, which excludes certain corporate costs, reconcile with the significant risk exposure described in the risk factors section, particularly given the segment's reliance on Bravecto and biologics manufacturing complexity?",
      "answer": "The Animal Health segment reported $1.938 billion in segment profits in 2024, calculated as sales less cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D directly incurred by the segment. However, the risk factors section highlights that this segment is exposed to material risks, including the potential impact of disease outbreaks on livestock demand and the operational complexity of manufacturing biologics and vaccines. Notably, Bravecto alone contributed $1.1 billion (19% of Animal Health sales), making the segment highly vulnerable to any negative event affecting this product. The segment profit metric does not reflect broader corporate costs or risk-adjusted performance considerations, suggesting that while the segment appears profitable, its financial stability is significantly exposed to operational and market risks that are not captured in the segment profit disclosure.",

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "question": "Given JNJ's overall growth rates in key business segments like Medical Devices and Surgery, how does the minimal 0.2% growth in Oral Care sales contrast with the company's broader performance, and what might this indicate about the strategic importance or challenges within the Consumer Health division?",
      "answer": "JNJ reported strong growth in major segments such as Medical Devices (10.4% to 34.0% growth) and Surgery (19.0% to 19.3% growth), indicating robust performance in high-margin, specialized areas. However, Oral Care sales within the Consumer Health division grew by only 0.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, despite total Consumer Health sales increasing by 4.1%. This disparity suggests that while the division as a whole is growing modestly, Oral Care is underperforming, potentially signaling market saturation, competitive pressure, or a lack of innovation in that category. This contrast highlights a strategic vulnerability in one of the division's core offerings.",

      "answer": "Merck's internal resource allocation strategy is guided by segment profit metrics that reflect the different cost structures and operational models of its Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments. The Pharmaceutical segment, which includes human health pharmaceuticals and vaccines, excludes Merck Research Laboratories' R&D expenses from its segment profits, indicating a centralized R&D model where innovation costs are not directly allocated to the segment's performance metrics. This contrasts with the Animal Health segment, which does include its directly incurred R&D costs within its segment profit calculation, suggesting a more integrated operational model. This distinction is further emphasized by the Pharmaceutical segment's significant profits of $44,533 million in 2024, compared to Animal Health's $1,938 million, highlighting the disproportionate financial contribution and strategic focus of the human health business. The CEO, as the chief operating decision maker, uses these segment profits during planning and forecasting, implying that the Pharmaceutical segment's structure and profitability drive a larger share of strategic resource allocation.",

      "answer": "The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment experienced a $189 million (3.2%) decline in adjusted operating income in 2024, primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, including lower contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. This decline is reflected in the broader context of segment performance, where the Corporate & Other segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $1,348 million in 2024, up from $1,318 million in 2023. The worsening loss in Corporate & Other, despite no direct revenue generation, suggests that corporate-level costs and strategic restructuring charges (e.g., $747 million in 2024) are being absorbed outside of the operating segments. This implies that financial pressures from underperforming segments like Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness may be partially offset or redistributed through internal restructuring and centralized cost management under the Corporate & Other segment.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "answer": "The equity income from affiliates in the Pharmaceutical segment surged from $11 million in 2021 to $39 million in 2022 and then to $111 million in 2023 \u2014 a 900% increase over two years. This sharp rise likely reflects the growing profitability of joint ventures or strategic alliances tied to the segment\u2019s top-performing products. In 2023, Keytruda generated $25.0 billion in total sales (up from $20.9 billion in 2022), and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 contributed $8.9 billion (up from $6.9 billion). The strong performance of these products likely boosted the returns from affiliated entities, suggesting that Merck\u2019s collaborative arrangements are closely tied to the commercial success of its core pharmaceutical offerings.",

      "answer": "Optum Insight's 30% year-over-year revenue growth from $14,581 million in 2022 to $18,932 million in 2023 directly contributed to the 19% increase in its earnings from operations, which rose from $3,588 million to $4,268 million. This indicates that despite the significant revenue growth, the operating margin for Optum Insight declined slightly from 24.6% to 22.5%, suggesting that the segment experienced some cost pressures or margin compression even as it achieved strong top-line expansion. This dynamic reflects a strategic trade-off between investing for growth and maintaining profitability.",

      "answer": "The acquisition of Cytiva contributed 210 basis points to the 2021 operating profit margin improvement due to fair value adjustments and integration costs. In 2022, the net cash consideration for acquisitions was $20,971 million, with $20,715 million attributed to Cytiva, which significantly increased goodwill by $10,171 million and other intangible assets by $10,656 million. This contrasts with other acquisitions, which contributed only $256 million in net cash consideration and $56 million in intangible assets, indicating that Cytiva was the dominant acquisition in terms of both financial outlay and long-term asset composition.",

The impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2021.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins were 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 19.0% in 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points\n- 2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points.\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points",

      "question": "How does the $5 million net realized capital loss specifically reported in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment relate to the $497 million total consolidated net realized capital loss, particularly in light of the yield-related impairment losses on debt securities disclosed in the notes?",
      "answer": "The $5 million net realized capital loss reported in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment represents a small fraction (approximately 1%) of the $497 million total consolidated net realized capital loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. This consolidated loss includes yield-related impairment losses on debt securities totaling $152 million, as disclosed in the notes. The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment's capital loss, while relatively minor compared to other segments, reflects the broader impact of these yield-related impairments across the company's investment portfolio. The segment's exposure to these losses may indicate a portion of capital allocated to debt securities that underperformed, aligning with the overall investment strategy and risk management framework described in the consolidated disclosures.",

Despite this, the segment's operating profit increased from $979 million in 2020 to $1,054 million in 2021, suggesting improved efficiency or profitability per unit of asset. Additionally, capital expenditures for the segment rose from $36 million in 2020 to $54 million in 2021, which may signal strategic reinvestment despite the overall decline in identifiable assets. This combination suggests that the segment improved its profitability even as its asset base contracted, potentially through better utilization of fewer assets or cost optimization.",

      "answer": "In 2024, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on Keytruda sales, reducing its growth by 4 percentage points (from 22% to 18%), primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Similarly, Animal Health sales were negatively affected by foreign exchange, reducing their growth by 4 percentage points as well (from 8% to 4%), with the Argentine peso accounting for approximately 2 percentage points of that drag. Both segments experienced the same macroeconomic headwind, but the fact that Keytruda's international demand growth still outpaced Animal Health's suggests a stronger underlying global demand for Keytruda despite FX volatility. This reveals that while Merck benefits from robust international sales, particularly in oncology, it remains significantly exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations in emerging markets like Argentina.",

( 2 )\n\nKeytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy that has been approved in over 40 indications in the U.S., including 18 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic indications, and has similarly been approved in markets worldwide for many of these indications. The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

      "answer": "Optum's revenues increased by $43,867 million (24%) in 2023 compared to 2022, while its earnings from operations rose by $1,887 million (13%). This disparity suggests that although the segment experienced robust revenue growth, its cost structure or operational efficiency may have faced pressures that limited the flow-through of revenue gains into earnings. The operating margin for Optum declined from 7.7% in 2022 to 7.0% in 2023, reinforcing the idea that the segment's costs increased at a faster rate than its revenues.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of $332 million in acquisition-related integration costs within the Corporate/Other segment in 2020 impact the evaluation of CVS's adjusted operating income growth when compared to the $132 million in such costs reported in 2021?",
      "answer": "The $332 million in acquisition-related integration costs included in the Corporate/Other segment for 2020 reflects significant expenses tied to post-acquisition activities, which are excluded to arrive at adjusted operating income of $16,008 million. In 2021, these costs dropped to $132 million, suggesting a reduction in integration activity. This decline implies that the company may have achieved greater operational stability post-acquisition by 2021, which supports a more favorable adjusted operating income margin relative to GAAP operating income. Understanding this trend is critical for assessing the long-term financial impact of acquisitions on CVS\u2019s profitability and operational efficiency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "answer": "The Corporate/Other segment reported an operating loss of $2,397 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which included $90 million in net realized capital losses. This specific $90 million component of the loss is further detailed in the investment section, where it is revealed that the total net realized capital losses for the company were $497 million, with $152 million attributed to yield-related impairment losses on debt securities, partially offset by a $3 million reversal of previously recorded credit-related impairments. Therefore, the $90 million in capital losses within the Corporate/Other segment represents a portion of the company\u2019s broader realized capital losses, which were primarily driven by debt security impairments. This connection reveals that a significant part of the Corporate/Other segment's underperformance was tied to investment-related losses, specifically in debt securities.",

      "answer": "Merck reported a 15% growth in Pharmaceutical segment profits in 2024, primarily driven by higher sales. However, in a separate section, the company discloses that it shares profits equally with Moderna on the V940 (mRNA-4157) collaboration, which is currently in Phase 3 trials. Despite the potential for future revenue from this collaboration, Merck is expensing the full development costs as R&D, which may temporarily depress profitability. This raises a key analytical question: how the company's current R&D burden on a profit-shared asset aligns with the reported growth in segment profits, and whether future revenue from the collaboration will meaningfully impact profitability or remain offset by shared gains.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense.

A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.

The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\n\n## Description of the Company and Business Segments\n\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-theCounter pharmaceutical, Women's Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company's Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\n## Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022\n\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\n\n## ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 'SOFR' where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  stated  maturities  of  greater  than  three  months  from  the  date  of  purchase  as current marketable securities.

Meanwhile, the identifiable assets for the Medical Devices segment rose from $49,578 million in 2020 to $53,372 million in 2021, an increase of $3,794 million or approximately 7.65%.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson invested $1,933 million in capital expenditures for Property, Plant & Equipment under the Medical Devices segment in 2021, reflecting a strategic emphasis on operational expansion or modernization. However, the same segment reported $2,377 million in R&D spending in 2021, which accounted for only 8.8% of sales, a modest return compared to the Pharmaceutical segment\u2019s 22.8%. This suggests a potential misalignment between the level of capital investment and the innovation efficiency in the Medical Devices segment, as higher capital additions might be expected to drive stronger R&D productivity.",

      "answer": "Optum's earnings from operations grew by $1,949 million (19%) in 2021 compared to 2020, driven primarily by Optum Health and Optum Insight, which saw increases of $1,028 million (30%) and $673 million (25%) respectively. However, Optum Rx's earnings increased only marginally by $248 million (6%), indicating a slower growth rate compared to the broader segment. This contrast reveals that while Optum as a whole is experiencing strong profitability growth, the performance is uneven across its business units, with Optum Rx contributing less to the overall earnings momentum.",

      "question": "How does UNH's risk factor disclosure about Optum Health's exposure to medical cost estimation risks reconcile with the segment performance report showing increased earnings from operations driven by higher investment income, given the company's significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations affecting investment returns?",
      "answer": "UNH's risk factors section (page 12) highlights that Optum Health's profitability is sensitive to its ability to estimate and manage medical costs under risk-based arrangements, with potential material adverse effects if actual costs exceed projections. However, the segment performance report (page 31) notes that Optum Health's earnings from operations increased, citing 'increased investment income' as a contributing factor despite challenges like Medicare Advantage funding reductions and higher medical costs. Meanwhile, the market risk section (page 38) reveals that as of December 31, 2024, $33 billion of UNH\u2019s financial assets are exposed to variable interest rates, directly impacting investment income. This suggests that while Optum Health faces operational risks tied to medical cost estimation, its financial performance may have been partially insulated or enhanced by favorable investment returns\u2014returns that are themselves subject to interest rate volatility. Thus, the earnings growth attributed to investment income may have offset some of the negative impacts from medical cost overruns, though this dynamic introduces a secondary risk tied to market interest rate movements.",

By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $33 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2024, $27 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fix ed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, $46 billion of our investments were fix ed-rate debt securities and $49 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fix ed-rate investments and fix ed-rate debt.\n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\n\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\n\n",

      "answer": "The increase in adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment by $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, including contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. However, this growth occurred alongside significant cost pressures in the same segment, as outlined in the cost of products sold section, which includes the cost of prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors, net of volume-related discounts. The segment\u2019s reliance on vendor allowances and purchase discounts highlights the importance of these discounts in maintaining profitability, even as competitive pressures and regulatory changes have limited the ability to retain a larger portion of rebates and fees. Therefore, while the segment achieved growth in adjusted operating income through strategic purchasing advantages, it remained exposed to cost volatility in drug procurement, requiring ongoing management of vendor relationships and discount structures to sustain margins.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

Intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ('PSS members') enrolled in Maintenance Choice elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company's retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis. \u00ae",

      "question": "How might the potential downgrade of CVS's long-term debt impact its 2025 financial outlook, particularly in relation to its $500 million enterprise-wide cost savings initiative and new store operating lease costs?",
      "answer": "A potential downgrade of CVS's long-term debt could increase its borrowing costs, limit access to capital markets, and raise new store operating lease costs, which would place pressure on the company\u2019s financial performance. This risk is particularly relevant given the company\u2019s expectation to generate over $500 million in cost savings in 2025 through its enterprise-wide restructuring plan. If debt rating agencies lower CVS's credit rating, the anticipated cost savings may be offset by increased financing and leasing expenses, thereby challenging the company\u2019s ability to maintain its projected financial performance and operational efficiency improvements.",

        "Hop 1: [CVS](page_92) \u2192 [Debt Ratings]: The company acknowledges that although it believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot predict future actions by rating agencies, and a downgrade could directly affect borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and new store operating lease costs.",
        "Hop 2: [Debt Ratings] \u2192 [New Store Operating Lease Costs]: The company explicitly states that its debt ratings have a direct impact on new store operating lease costs, indicating a financial linkage between creditworthiness and real estate-related expenditures.",
        "Hop 3: [New Store Operating Lease Costs] \u2190 [CVS](page_76): In the 2025 Outlook section, the company notes that actions by ratings agencies could impact future borrowing costs, access to capital, and new store operating lease costs\u2014highlighting the sensitivity of its operational strategy to credit conditions, especially as it seeks to realize over $500 million in cost savings through restructuring."

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",
