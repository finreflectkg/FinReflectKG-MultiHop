      "answer": "A 5% improvement in claim frequency rates would result in a decrease of approximately $290 million in UPS's self-insurance reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. This is significant given that UPS reported $1,048 million in self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021. The sensitivity analysis indicates that changes in claim frequency directly influence the company's liability estimates and expense recognition.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Corporate Items and Eliminations segment reported a negative contribution of $413 million to total sales and revenues in 2021, indicating intercompany transaction eliminations or other adjustments that reduce consolidated revenue figures. Despite this, Caterpillar achieved a 23% increase in consolidated sales and revenues to $13.798 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher end-user demand across regions\u2014such as a 29% increase in North America and a 40% increase in Latin America\u2014and favorable dealer inventory dynamics, where dealer inventory decreases were significantly less severe in 2021 ($100 million) compared to 2020 ($1.1 billion). This shows that strong external demand and pricing realization across reportable segments more than offset the negative adjustments from Corporate Items and Eliminations.",

          "chunk_text": "## FOURTH QUARTER 2021 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2020\n\n## CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES\n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2020 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2021 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "The $7,875 million revenue increase at BCA in 2023 was primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries, which directly supported the $706 million decrease in BCA's loss from operations. This operational improvement reflects the positive impact of increased deliveries on cost absorption and lower abnormal production costs, despite continued R&D spending. The ongoing ramp-up in deliveries, as noted in the forward-looking statement on page 26, indicates that Boeing's financial recovery hinges on stabilizing production and increasing delivery volumes to offset prior losses and abnormal costs.",

        "Hop 2: BCA \u2192 Higher Deliveries: Higher deliveries contributed to lower abnormal production costs and improved operational performance, resulting in a $706 million decrease in BCA's loss from operations.",
        "Hop 3: Higher Deliveries \u2190 BA(page_32): Continued improvement in BCA's operational performance is tied to the ongoing ramp-up in deliveries, which is critical for further reducing losses and stabilizing production costs."

      "answer": "The Safety and Industrial segment's employee-related expense decreased from $89 million in 2023 to $72 million in 2024, reflecting a reduction in personnel costs. Despite this decline, the segment participated in the General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), which contributed $12 million in compensation expense company-wide in 2024. This indicates that while the segment reduced overall employee-related spending, it still incurred significant costs related to equity-based compensation through the GESPP. The continued participation in the plan suggests that the company maintains incentive structures for employees in this segment, even amid broader cost containment efforts.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $0.8 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020, were primarily due to the change in Acquisitions / divestitures, net of $399 million, primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, an increase in mix and other performance of $292 million primarily due to a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of RIS's global training and services business in December 2021, as further discussed in 'Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the net favorable change in EAC adjustments of $132 million, which was primarily driven by the absence of $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in 2020.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019\n\nThe increase in net sales of $11.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $1.0 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 were due  to  the  Raytheon  Merger.  Included  in  operating  profit  in  2020  were  $124  million  of  unfavorable  EAC  adjustments  for  loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position, of which $87 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nBacklog and Bookings - Backlog was $18 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $19 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in the decrease in backlog was a $0.9 billion adjustment related to the sale of RIS's global training and services business discussed above. In 2021, RIS booked $4.8 billion on a number of classified contracts, $672 million of Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) products and services contracts in the fourth quarter of 2021 including the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) for  the  F35  Joint  Strike  Fighter  program,  $419  million  on  the  Next  Generation  Jammer  (NGJ)  Mid-Band  Low  Rate  Initial Production (LRIP) contract with the U.S. Navy, $365 million on the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) program for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $227 million on a missile warning and defense contract, $211 million to provide additional upgrades to the Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control System (GPS OCX) program for  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  $199  million  on  an  international  tactical  airborne  radar  sustainment  contract,  and  $185  million  on  an international training contract with the U.K. Royal Navy.\n\n## Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense\n\n",

      "answer": "RTX's 2023 consolidated operating profit margin was 5.2%, with Pratt & Whitney reporting a significant operating loss margin of -8.0% for the year. Despite this, RTX's consolidated operating profit margin improved to 8.1% in 2024. This improvement occurred alongside a notable increase in credit loss reserves at Pratt & Whitney, driven by a customer bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2024, which suggests that despite deteriorating credit quality and losses in its aerospace segment, RTX as a whole experienced stronger profitability across other segments or operational improvements that offset Pratt & Whitney's drag.",

        "Hop 1: RTX(page_86) \u2192 Pratt & Whitney: Pratt & Whitney experienced a customer bankruptcy in Q4 2024, leading to a significant increase in credit loss reserves to $491 million by year-end.",

      "answer": "3M's spending discipline in 2024 contributed $0.77 per share to earnings growth from continuing operations, reflecting strong cost control and restructuring benefits, including a $30 million cumulative translation adjustment restructuring benefit. However, despite these benefits, business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year when adjusting for special item PFAS manufacturing exit costs. This indicates that while spending discipline positively impacted earnings, broader operational challenges such as lower sales volumes, inflation, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, and China-related issues outweighed the margin benefits. Thus, the positive impact of spending discipline was insufficient to offset structural pressures affecting margins when non-recurring PFAS-related costs were excluded.",

The year-on-year impact of non-Solventum related transition services agreements is included in acquisitions/divestitures as further described below.\n\nIn 2023, the following components impacted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share year-on-year:\n\n- Declines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year and the 2022 exit of operations in Russia negatively impacted earnings (loss) per share by $0.38.\n- Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year increase of $0.61 per share which was impacted by the following:\n- Benefits from spending discipline, sourcing actions, restructuring, higher selling prices and ongoing productivity actions\n- Lower sales volumes (particularly electronics/consumer retail); investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability;\n- manufacturing/supply chain headwinds; inflation impacts; China; and Europe's geopolitical impacts\n- In 2024 and 2023, lower defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost decreased expense year-on-year.\n\n## Restructuring and related charges:\n\n- 3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of $187 million, $415 million, and $16 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively, related to the 2023 to 2025 structural reorganization actions and 2020 through 2022 operational/marketing capability actions (refer to Note 6 for additional discussion). The 2024 pre-tax charge included a $30 million cumulative translation adjustment restructuring benefit as certain entities were substantially liquidated in the fourth quarter of 2024. That benefit is reflected in organic growth/productivity and other as described above. In addition, 3M recorded certain pre-tax adjustments, accelerated depreciation and other charges related to these actions of $44 million and $4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 3M also recorded restructuring charges in 2023 and 2024 for PFAS exit actions and in 2022 for divestiture-related restructuring actions as further described in Note 6 which are part of the manufactured PFAS products and divestiture-related restructuring actions special items, respectively (see the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below).\n\n## Foreign exchange impacts:\n\n- Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income from continuing operations by approximately $101 million (or a decrease of pre-tax income by approximately $104 million) year-on-year for 2024. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) increased operating loss from continuing operations by approximately $116 million (or a increase of pre-tax  loss by approx imately $111 million) year-on-year for 2023. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n\n\u2022",

      "answer": "Emerson reported a cash inflow of $9,475 million from investing activities related to Climate Technologies in 2023, which aligns with the strategic divestiture of the majority stake in Climate Technologies (renamed Copeland) to Blackstone for $14 billion in May 2023. This indicates that the divestiture was a major contributor to the company's investing cash flow for that year. Additionally, Emerson retained a 40% non-controlling equity interest and a note receivable, which were later fully monetized in 2024 for an additional $3.4 billion. The financial data from the cash flow statement and the strategic narrative in the business overview section together illustrate how the divestiture not only supported Emerson\u2019s portfolio transformation strategy but also significantly bolstered its liquidity and financial flexibility in the short term.",

      "answer": "The reduction in 'Purchased Transportation' expenses, which decreased from $21,790 million in 2023 to $20,921 million in 2024, directly contributed to the improved operating results at FedEx Logistics. This improvement was primarily due to lower purchased transportation and bad debt expenses, despite a decrease in revenue. FedEx Logistics, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions and specialty transportation, benefits from intersegment collaboration where other FedEx companies provide transportation services at negotiated rates. These intersegment services, such as FedEx Express working with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters, are designed to optimize resources and are reflected in the consolidated results after elimination of intercompany transactions. This indicates that the company\u2019s strategy of leveraging internal synergies is playing a role in improving segment-level profitability despite external revenue challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, the improvement in operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to decreased professional fees and business optimization expenses at FedEx Corporate and improved operating results at FedEx Logistics. The improved operating results at FedEx Logistics were primarily due to lower purchased transportation and bad debt expense, partially offset by decreased revenue. The comparison of operating loss between 2024 and 2023 at Corporate, other, and eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks in 2023.\n\nCertain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources. For example, during 2024 FedEx Ground provided delivery support for certain FedEx Express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and FedEx Freight provided road and intermodal support for both FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. In addition, FedEx Express worked with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters and other cargo space for U.S. customers. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.\n\n## FEDEX EXPRESS SEGMENT\n\nFedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight including priority, deferred, and economy services, which provide delivery on a time-definite or day-definite basis. The following table compares revenue, operating expenses, operating income (dollars in millions), operating margin, and operating expenses as a percent of revenue for the years ended May 31:\n\n",

We reviewed and evaluated the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance was evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.\n\nOperating expenses for each of our transportation segments included the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations included charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs were based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximated the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies were refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.\n\n## Other Intersegment Transactions\n\nCorporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing integrated business solutions through our FedEx Dataworks operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. ShopRunner, Inc. was merged into FedEx Dataworks during 2023.\n\nAlso included in Corporate and other is the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. ('FedEx Office') operating segment, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding.\n\nThe results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.\n\nCertain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources.

      "question": "How does the growth in Caterpillar's Construction Industries segment sales in 2021 align with the corresponding depreciation and amortization expenses for that segment, and what might this imply about the company's capital investment strategy in that business unit?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's Construction Industries segment saw a significant increase in sales and revenues in 2021, rising from $16.918 billion in 2020 to $22.106 billion in 2021\u2014a $5.188 billion increase. However, the segment's depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from $245 million in 2020 to $237 million in 2021. This inverse relationship suggests that despite strong revenue growth, Caterpillar may not have significantly increased its capital investments in the Construction Industries segment during this period. This could imply either efficient utilization of existing assets or a strategic decision to delay new capital expenditures despite rising demand.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "The Missiles and Fire Control segment experienced a consistent increase in intersegment sales, rising from $618 million in 2021 to $688 million in 2023. Despite this upward trend, the company clarifies in its consolidated financial reporting that intersegment sales are excluded from consolidated operating results because they are eliminated during consolidation. This means that while the segment-level data reflects these internal sales, they do not contribute to the overall consolidated revenue or operating profit of the company, as they represent internal transfers rather than external transactions. This exclusion ensures that the consolidated financial statements accurately reflect only the economic value generated from external customers.",

      "question": "Given Raytheon's decline in operating profit from $2,448 million in 2022 to $2,379 million in 2023, how does the reduction in Raytheon's development program spending in 2024 align with the overall trend in operating profit margins across RTX's business segments?",
      "answer": "Raytheon's operating profit declined from $2,448 million in 2022 to $2,379 million in 2023, with its operating margin dropping from 9.7% to 9.0%. This decline suggests weakening profitability within the segment despite stable net sales growth. Meanwhile, RTX's overall company-funded R&D spending increased by $0.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, but this increase was partially offset by lower development program spending at Raytheon. This implies a strategic shift in R&D investment away from Raytheon toward Collins and Pratt & Whitney. The decline in Raytheon's operating profit and reduced R&D investment in its development programs may reflect either a strategic reallocation of resources or underlying performance issues within Raytheon's programs, which contrasts with the increased investment and improved operating performance seen in Collins Aerospace and the more mixed results in Pratt & Whitney.",

      "question": "How does MMM's strategic emphasis on growth in the Safety and Industrial segment, particularly in roofing granules, reconcile with the relatively modest absolute sales increase in roofing granules from $494 million in 2023 to $521 million in 2024 despite broader industrial market weakness?",
      "answer": "MMM's Safety and Industrial segment highlights roofing granules as a key growth driver amid mixed industrial demand, especially pointing to replacement demand in residential roofing as a growth catalyst. However, the actual sales increase in roofing granules\u2014from $494 million in 2023 to $521 million in 2024\u2014represents only a $27 million or 5.5% increase. This modest growth occurred despite broader weakness in other industrial submarkets like industrial adhesives and abrasives, which declined. The segment's operating income margin expansion is attributed to productivity and spending discipline, suggesting that while roofing granules contributed to growth, the segment's overall performance was more significantly influenced by cost control and other product lines. Thus, the qualitative emphasis on roofing granules as a growth lever appears somewhat disproportionate to its quantitative impact on the segment's overall performance.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "GE's Commercial Engines & Services segment participates in customer-sponsored supply chain finance programs, through which the company sold $494 million in current customer receivables in 2024 and received cash at the original invoice value and due date. This financial activity supports the segment's cash flow and operational liquidity. Meanwhile, the equity method investment balance for Commercial Engines & Services increased to $1,610 million in 2024 from $1,551 million in 2023, indicating growing investment in joint ventures or partnerships that likely support long-term engine programs. The increase in equity method investment balance suggests a strategic expansion of collaborative arrangements, which may be funded or supported in part by the liquidity generated through supply chain finance programs.

      "question": "Given the significant capital expenditures allocated to the Energy & Transportation segment in 2023, how does its segment-level profit performance compare with the overall corporate operating profit, and what does this suggest about the segment's contribution to the company's financial health?",
      "answer": "The Energy & Transportation segment received the largest capital expenditure allocation among all segments at $944 million in 2023. This segment also delivered a strong profit of $4.936 billion, representing a 49% increase from 2022, with a profit margin of 17.6%. In comparison, the overall corporate operating profit was $12.966 billion in 2023, meaning the Energy & Transportation segment contributed nearly 38% of the total operating profit. This suggests that the segment is a critical driver of Caterpillar\u2019s financial performance, despite facing headwinds such as higher material costs and SG&A/R&D expenses. The segment\u2019s robust profit growth and margin expansion indicate a strong return on the capital invested, reinforcing its strategic importance to the company.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Pratt & Whitney recorded a $2.9 billion pre-tax operating profit charge related to the PW1100 powder metal issue, primarily to cover expected customer compensation and increased maintenance costs. This resulted in a $2.8 billion increase in Other Accrued Liabilities. By December 31, 2024, this liability had decreased to $1.7 billion, indicating that $1.1 billion in compensation was likely issued through credits or cash payments during 2024. This suggests that while a significant portion of the obligation has been addressed, a remaining liability of $1.7 billion still reflects ongoing customer compensation commitments tied to the engine inspections and shop visits expected through 2026.",

Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices.  We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Estimating  our  liability  based  on  both  the  likelihood  of  any  adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution.\n\nIn 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo. This determination was made pursuant to Pratt &amp; Whitney's safety management system.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney issued a special instruction (SI) to operators of PW1100 GTF powered A320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and  engine  removals  covering  an  initial  subset  of  operational  engines,  no  later  than  September  15,  2023.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2023,  through  its  safety management system, Pratt &amp; Whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment, which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining PW1100 fleet. This updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. G uidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (SB) and SI in November 2023, and this guidance has been reflected in airworthiness  directives  issued  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).  Consistent  with  previous  information,  the  actions  are  resulting  in  significant incremental shop visits.\n\nAs a result of this matter, Pratt &amp; Whitney expects aircraft on ground levels for the PW1100 powered A320neo fleet to remain elevated through 2026. As a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, Pratt &amp; Whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $2.9 billion, reflecting Pratt &amp; Whitney's net 51% program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt &amp; Whitney's long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business's long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.\n\nThe charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion, which principally related to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had other accrued liabilities of $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to ex pected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during 2024 was primarily due to customer compensation in the form of credits issued and cash paid to customers during the period.\n\nOther engine models within Pratt &amp; Whitney's fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical ex perience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans. We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based  on  company  data  and  appropriate  market  indicators.  They  are  evaluated  annually  at  December  31  and  when  significant  events  require  a  mid-year remeasurement.  A  change  in  any  of  these  assumptions  or  actual  experience  that  differs  from  these  assumptions  are  subject  to  recognition  in  pension  and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAssumptions  used  in  the  accounting  for  these  employee  benefit  plans  require  judgement.  Major  assumptions  include  the  discount  rate  and  EROA.  Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows.",

      "answer": "MMM projects that its postretirement benefit payments will increase from $144 million in 2024 to $162 million in 2028, reflecting a growing financial obligation to retirees. This upward trend in expected payments aligns with a broader context of actuarial losses in recent years, including a $124 million actuarial loss in 2023 for postretirement benefits, which contributed to an increase in the benefit obligation from $1,797 million in 2022 to $1,897 million in 2023. Despite these rising obligations, the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans deteriorated further, falling from a funded surplus of $1,017 million in 2022 to $980 million in 2023. This declining funded status suggests that MMM's postretirement benefit liabilities are growing faster than the growth in plan assets, which could place additional pressure on the company's financial flexibility as it meets its increasing postretirement benefit payment commitments over the next five years.",

      "question": "What impact do rising fuel prices and employee compensation costs have on UPS's SMB-focused growth strategy in its Domestic Package segment?",
      "answer": "UPS's U.S. Domestic Package segment experienced strong volume growth driven by SMBs, with revenue per piece increasing through base rate hikes, favorable customer mix, and fuel and demand-related surcharges. However, this growth was accompanied by rising operating expenses, primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased employee compensation and benefit costs. While productivity improvements offered slight mitigation, the cost pressures pose a challenge to sustaining profitability from the SMB-driven volume growth. This dynamic highlights the tension between leveraging SMB demand for revenue expansion and managing the cost structure that threatens margin stability in the segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(page_9) \u2192 U.S. Domestic Package Segment: The segment is a core part of UPS's business and is highlighted as the primary source of revenue from major customers like Amazon, with specific attention to the operational costs such as fuel and employee compensation.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Domestic Package Segment \u2192 SMB: SMBs are identified as a key growth driver in this segment, directly contributing to package volume increases and revenue growth through rate increases and surcharges.",
        "Hop 3: SMB \u2190 UPS(page_29): The financial performance section notes that while SMB-driven volume growth boosted revenue, rising fuel prices and employee compensation costs significantly increased operating expenses, potentially offsetting some of the gains."

          "chunk_text": "## Employee health and safety\n\nWe are committed to industry-leading employee health, safety and wellness programs across our growing workforce. We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

Despite past challenges that led to significant impairments, UPS is doubling down on expanding the segment through targeted acquisitions\u2014specifically in technology-enabled returns (Happy Returns) and specialized logistics (MNX Global Logistics).

Concurrently, the Power segment reported $5,772 million in total contract and other deferred assets as of December 31, 2022, with a notable $3,640 million tied to long-term service agreements. This suggests that GE's current R&D spending may be aimed at developing technologies or services that support long-duration contracts, where revenue is recognized over time rather than upfront.

      "answer": "In 2023, both the Health Care and Consumer segments experienced year-on-year decreases in operating income margins, with investments in the business playing a significant role in both. In Health Care, the margin decline was driven by costs associated with building out the team ahead of the planned spin-off and other strategic investments. In contrast, the Consumer segment\u2019s margin pressure stemmed from continued investments amid weaker demand trends and shifting consumer spending patterns toward non-discretionary items. While both segments faced margin contraction due to investments, the nature of these investments differed\u2014Health Care\u2019s were tied to structural readiness for separation, while Consumer\u2019s were made in a context of declining sales volumes and discretionary pullback.",

      "question": "How does MMM's strategic emphasis on growth in bonding solutions for electronic devices relate to the year-on-year increase in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes sales, despite the overall flat performance of the Safety and Industrial segment in U.S. dollar terms?",
      "answer": "MMM's Safety and Industrial segment reported flat sales in U.S. dollar terms in 2024, but highlighted growth in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes sales, which increased from $2,051 million in 2023 to $2,104 million in 2024. This growth was attributed to strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, auto body repair, and cable accessories. Despite the segment's overall flat performance, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes emerged as a key growth driver, indicating that MMM's strategic focus on electronics-related bonding solutions contributed positively to this sub-category. This aligns with MMM's broader effort to leverage productivity, spending discipline, and market-specific growth opportunities, even as other areas within the segment experienced declines or remained flat.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount.

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

Despite this growth, Resource Industries' profit margin declined from 12.5% in Q4 2020 to 11.0% in Q4 2021, indicating rising costs. Additionally, Resource Industries had the second-highest depreciation and amortization at $403 million in 2021, suggesting significant capital investment.

The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume,  driven  by higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  aftermarket  parts,  and  favorable  price  realization.  End-user  demand  was  higher  in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "Collins Aerospace contributed $26,253 million in net sales to RTX's consolidated total in 2023, with an operating profit of $3,825 million, resulting in an operating margin of 14.6%. The segment also accounted for $786 million in capital expenditures and held $72,372 million in total assets as of 2024. This indicates that while Collins Aerospace delivers a relatively strong operating margin, it also requires significant capital investment, as reflected in its asset base and capex allocation, compared to other RTX segments like Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon.",

      "answer": "The Resource Industries segment reported depreciation and amortization expenses of $403 million in 2021, which is significant compared to its operating profit of $305 million for the same period. This indicates that the segment's operating profit was notably constrained by these non-cash expenses. On a consolidated basis, CAT reported an operating profit of $6,878 million for 2021, meaning the Resource Industries segment contributed approximately 4.4% to the company's total operating profit despite its relatively high depreciation burden. This highlights the segment's capital-intensive nature and its constrained profitability in comparison to the broader company's performance.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Abrasives sales within the Safety and Industrial segment align with MMM's strategic focus and resource allocation decisions as reflected in their business segment management structure post-Solventum spin-off?",
      "answer": "The decline in Abrasives sales, which fell from $1,343 million in 2022 to $1,295 million in 2024, is part of a broader trend of decreasing sales in certain Safety and Industrial subcategories. This aligns with MMM's strategic refocusing post-Solventum spin-off, as evidenced by the restructured business segment reporting and the elimination of the Health Care segment. The Safety and Industrial segment, which now includes adjusted cost allocations and transition arrangements, reflects MMM's ongoing effort to streamline operations and reallocate resources toward more growth-oriented areas such as electronics and transportation. The segment's operating income margins improved despite the drop in abrasives sales, indicating that MMM is managing profitability through productivity and spending discipline, suggesting a strategic pivot away from declining categories like abrasives toward more resilient or high-growth markets.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "question": "How does UPS's reliance on fuel surcharges for revenue growth in 2022 align with its strategic focus on value share gains in the International Package segment, given the impact of rising fuel prices on operating expenses?",
      "answer": "UPS applies weekly fuel surcharges on domestic air and ground services, which contributed to revenue per piece growth across customer segments. In the International Package segment, revenue and revenue per piece increases were attributed to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, and favorable currency movements. However, operating expenses in this segment also rose due to higher network costs driven by fuel price increases. This dynamic presents a tension between leveraging fuel surcharges to boost revenue and managing the corresponding rise in fuel-related operating costs, which could offset some of the gains. UPS's strategic focus on value share gains in the International Package segment must therefore balance surcharge-driven pricing with cost containment measures to maintain profitability.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), founded in 1907, is the world's premier package delivery company and a leading provider of global supply chain management solutions. We offer a broad range of industry-leading products and services through our extensive presence in North America; Europe; the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa ('ISMEA'); Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our services include transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage and insurance.\n\nWe operate one of the largest airlines and one of the largest fleets of alternative fuel vehicles under a global UPS brand. We deliver packages each business day for approximately 1.7 million shipping customers to 11.8 million delivery customers in over 220 countries and territories. In 2021, we delivered an average of 25.2 million packages per day, totaling 6.4 billion packages during the year. Total revenue in 2021 was $97.3 billion.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur well-defined strategy focuses on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including business-to-business (\"B2B\"), healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") and large enterprise accounts. We are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy as we transform our business.\n\nCustomer First is about reducing the friction of doing business. We help our customers seize new opportunities, compete, and succeed by delivering the capabilities that they tell us matter the most: speed and ease.\n\nPeople Led specifically focuses on how likely an employee is to recommend UPS employment to a friend or family member. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture, so we are striving to make UPS a great place to work. Through our transformation initiatives, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. We are also enhancing the employee value proposition to align with evolving market practices.\n\nInnovation Driven is designed to optimize the volume that flows through our network, to focus on increasing value share and driving business growth from higher-yielding opportunities in our target markets. We are using technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network. In our United States (\" U.S.\") Domestic Package segment, our aim is to improve revenue mix and lower our cost to serve. Within the International Package segment and Supply Chain Solutions businesses, we are focused on value share gains and growing operating profit.",

      "answer": "LMT's Aeronautics segment reported a stable operating profit of $2,825M on net sales of $27,474M in 2023, yielding a margin of approximately 10.3%. However, the company's risk factors highlight that fixed-price contracts, especially development programs, carry substantial risk of cost overruns that could reduce margins or result in reach-forward losses. Despite this, the Aeronautics segment's profitability appears resilient, suggesting either strong cost control measures, successful execution on fixed-price contracts, or a mix shift toward contracts with lower risk profiles. This contrast indicates that while the company acknowledges systemic risks in fixed-price development contracts, the Aeronautics segment has managed to maintain profitability, possibly through improved estimating, operational efficiencies, or favorable contract structuring.",

      "question": "How does the increase in operating profit attributed to the Financial Products Segment compare with its depreciation and amortization expenses, and what does this suggest about the segment's profitability trends?",
      "answer": "The Financial Products Segment experienced a 27% increase in operating profit from $195 million in 2020 to $248 million in 2021, as disclosed in the segment profit table. Simultaneously, the segment reported depreciation and amortization expenses of $772 million in 2021, which remained relatively stable compared to $773 million in 2020. This indicates that despite a significant increase in operating profit, the segment's depreciation and amortization expenses remained flat, suggesting that the profit growth was not primarily driven by new asset investments but rather by operational efficiency or revenue growth within the segment.",

        "Hop 1: CAT(page_61) \u2192 Profit: Discloses consolidated operating profit, including segment-level details showing the Financial Products Segment's operating profit increased from $195 million in 2020 to $248 million in 2021.",

      "question": "How does the increase in BCA revenues driven by higher 737 deliveries in 2022 relate to the reduction in BCA's loss from operations in 2023, given the changes in abnormal production costs and R&D spending?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BCA revenues increased by $6,312 million, primarily driven by higher 737 and 787 deliveries, which contributed to improved operational performance. This momentum continued into 2023, where BCA\u2019s loss from operations decreased by $706 million compared to 2022, reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses, including a reduction in abnormal production costs from $1,753 million in 2022 to $1,527 million in 2023. However, this improvement was partially offset by increased spending on research and development. Therefore, the revenue gains from higher 737 deliveries in 2022 laid the foundation for operational improvements in 2023, amplified by cost controls and reduced abnormal production costs, despite higher R&D investments.",

      "answer": "The increase in 737 deliveries from 387 in 2022 to 396 in 2023, despite ongoing supply chain and labor challenges, contributed to a $7,875 million revenue growth in the BCA segment in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries, but the continued rise in 737 deliveries indicates gradual improvement in production stability. The revenue growth across all segments, including BCA, suggests that Boeing is on a recovery path, although the pace remains sensitive to external factors like supply chain and labor conditions.",

      "answer": "FedEx Freight's revenue declined by 6% in 2024 due to lower shipments and fuel surcharges, but this was partially offset by base yield improvement, which the company attributes to a continued focus on revenue quality. This base yield improvement is also explicitly cited in the revenue section as a factor driving performance in the FedEx Ground segment, which saw a 2% revenue increase. The strategic importance of FedEx Ground is further underscored by its inclusion as a reportable segment and its integration under the 'One FedEx' initiative, which aims to unify the air-ground network for improved efficiency. Together, these points indicate that FedEx Ground played a pivotal role in stabilizing yield pressures across the broader transportation network, particularly in offsetting declines in FedEx Freight and FedEx Express.",

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower yields and reduced volume at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics'). FedEx Freight revenue decreased 6% in 2024 primarily due to lower shipments, weight per shipment, and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement. FedEx Ground revenue increased 2% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement and higher volume, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax , or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx  Dataworks.

This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related ex penditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the aggregate pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.",

Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective.  We  designate  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  at  inception  of  the  contract,  and  we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\n\nFinancial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial's debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify  the  debt  structure  to  match  assets  within  the  receivables  portfolio.  This  matched  funding  reduces  the  volatility  of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\n\nOur policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the matchfunding objective.  We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\n\nWe have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&amp;T and Financial Products.  We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.\n\n## C. Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\n\nOur ME&amp;T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers.  Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\n\nOur objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and  option  contracts  to  lock  in  the  purchase  price  of  a  portion  of  these  commodities  within  a  five-year  horizon.

This was partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 3.6 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.2 percent).\n- 2020 net mark-to-market loss of $383 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. This was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 16.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.1 percent).\n- 2019 net mark-to-market loss of $468 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. This was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 22.3 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent).\n\n## SENSITIVITY\n\n## Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity\n\nME&amp;T operations  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  to  manage  unmatched  foreign  currency  cash  inflow  and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&amp;T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2022 cash flow for our ME&amp;T operations by approximately $89 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $126 million adverse impact on 2021 cash flow.  We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.\n\nIn managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.\n\nThe effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In  reality,  some  currencies  may  weaken  while  others  may  strengthen.  Our  primary  exposure  (excluding  competitive  risk)  is  to exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nFor our ME&amp;T operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedto-floating  interest  rate  contracts  to  fixed-rate  debt,  and  by  entering  into  forward  rate  agreements  on  future  debt  issuances.   A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the  2022  pre-tax  earnings  of  ME&amp;T.  Last  year,  similar  assumptions  and  calculations  yielded  a  minimal  impact  to  2021  pre-tax earnings.\n\nFor our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating  rate  and  duration)  of  our  debt  portfolio  with  the  interest  rate  profile  of  our  finance  receivable  portfolio  within  a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt  structure  to  match  assets  within  the  finance  receivable  portfolio.  Match  funding  reduces  the  volatility  of  margins  between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.",

While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension ex pense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions.

The change at  Collins  was  spread  across  numerous  individual  programs,  with  no  individual  or  common  significant  driver.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt &amp; Whitney and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. The change at Pratt was primarily driven by the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter. The change at  Collins  was  spread  across  numerous  individual  programs,  with  no  individual  or  common  significant  driver.  The  change  at  Raytheon  was  primarily  due  to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts.\n\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fix ed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.\n\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt &amp; Whitney and to a lesser extent at Collins and Raytheon. Included in the change at Pratt &amp; Whitney was the unfavorable impact of $0.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the  Powder  Metal  Matter and an unfavorable impact of approximately $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost on a military program. The change in net EAC adjustments at Pratt &amp; Whitney also includes the absence of a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to unfavorable  changes  in  net  EAC  adjustments  related  to  certain  fix ed  price  development  contracts  and  $51  million  of  unfavorable  EAC  adjustments  related  to significant contract options exercised in 2023.",

Despite this, Adjusted EBITA for the segment improves from $529M to $645M (22% growth), and the Adjusted EBITA margin expands from 25.8% to 27.0%, suggesting that operational efficiencies or cost controls may be offsetting the increased amortization burden.",

      "answer": "UPS reported a decline in operating profit due to macroeconomic conditions, union labor-related uncertainties, and reductions in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Specifically, the U.S. Domestic Package segment saw wage rate increases due to the new Teamsters contract, which partially offset reductions in operating costs. The operating profit for 2023 was $9.141 billion, down significantly from $13.094 billion in 2022. Meanwhile, investment income and other, which includes non-operational financial gains, dropped to $217 million in 2023 from $2,435 million in 2022. This sharp decline in investment income suggests that UPS could not rely on non-operational income to meaningfully offset the pressures on operating profit. The interconnectedness of these metrics highlights that while investment income contributes to overall financial performance, it was insufficient in 2023 to counterbalance the significant operational headwinds.",

      "question": "Given the strong international interest in the F-35 program and its contribution to Aeronautics' net sales, how does the segment's expected low-single-digit growth in 2022 align with the reported backlog decrease attributed to F-35 production contract delays?",
      "answer": "The F-35 program is highlighted as a key driver of international interest and a significant component of Aeronautics' business, contributing to its net sales with strong international participation. However, despite this interest, the backlog for Aeronautics decreased in 2021 due to prolonged negotiations on F-35 production contracts, which led to lower orders. This suggests that while international demand remains robust, execution delays on contract negotiations have constrained near-term revenue conversion. Aeronautics' guidance for 2022 projects low-single-digit net sales growth, primarily driven by F-16, F-22, and classified programs, which may indicate a strategic shift or reliance on other platforms to offset the F-35's production delays. This alignment shows a cautious outlook where growth expectations are tempered by current production and contracting challenges on the F-35 program.",

The measure increases the debt limit to $31.4 trillion from the previous level of $28.9 trillion and is estimated to provide sufficient government borrowing capacity to last until early 2023.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening  our  relationships  internationally  through  partnerships  and  joint  technology  efforts.  Our  international  business  is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2021, approximately 69% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 31% were DCS. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  35%  of  Aeronautics'  net  sales.  There  continues  to  be  strong  international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment  include  the  F-16  and  C-130J  programs,  which  continue  to  draw  interest  from international customers for new aircraft.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers accounted for 29% of MFC's net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide  missile  defense  capabilities.  THAAD  is  an  integrated  system  designed  to  protect  against  high  altitude  ballistic  missile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Germany and Taiwan and for Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) from Australia.\n\nIn 2021, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS' net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production,  modernization,  ship  integration,  test  and  lifetime  support  for  ships  of  international  customers  such  as  Japan,  Spain, Republic  of  Korea,  and  Australia.  We  have  ongoing  combat  systems  programs  associated  with  different  classes  of  surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Canada,  Singapore,  Australia,  Germany  and  France.  We  have  active  development, production,  and  sustainment  support  of  the  S-70  Black  Hawk\u00ae  and  MH-60  Seahawk\u00ae  helicopters  to  international  customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Greece. Additionally, in December 2021,  the  Israeli  Ministry  of  Defense  signed  a  Letter  of  Offer  and Acceptance  (LOA)  to  procure  12  CH-53K  King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  8%  of  Space's  net  sales.  The  majority  of  our  Space  business  segment international  sales  in  2021  were  from  our  majority  share  of  AWE  Management  Limited  (AWE),  which  operated  the  United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent program until June 30, 2021. As previously announced, on June 30, 2021 the UK Ministry of Defence renationalized  AWE  and,  accordingly,  the  AWE  program's  ongoing  operations  are  no  longer  included  in  our  financial  results beginning as of that date.\n\n## Status of the F-35 Program\n\nThe  F-35  program  primarily  consists  of  production  contracts,  sustainment  activities,  and  new  development  efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAeronautics' net sales in 2021 increased $482 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher  net  sales  of  approximately  $290  million  on  classified  contracts  due  to  higher  volume;  about  $180  million  for  the  F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower  volume  on  development  contracts;  and  about  $30  million  for  the  C-130  program  primarily  due  to  higher  volume  on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the  second  quarter  of  2021  for  performance  issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  that  was  partially  offset  by  higher  risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset  by  higher  risk  retirements  and  volume  on  sustainment  contracts.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for  the  F-16  program  due  to  higher  risk  retirements  on  sustainment  contracts  and  higher  production  volume. Adjustments  not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Aeronautics' 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit range above 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021 levels.\n\n## Missiles and Fire Control\n\nOur  MFC  business  segment  provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon  systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services;  manned  and  unmanned  ground  vehicles;  and  energy  management  solutions.  MFC's  major  programs  include  PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER\u00ae), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21\u00ae) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS).

      "answer": "The 4.5% total sales decline in the Transportation and Electronics segment, which includes the Advanced Materials reporting unit, aligns with the strategic decision to exit PFAS manufacturing. This decision directly contributed to a goodwill impairment charge for the Advanced Materials unit in 2022, indicating that the financial performance deterioration was severe enough to impair long-term value expectations. The impairment charge, combined with the sales decline, highlights the significant financial impact of exiting PFAS manufacturing across both the operational performance (Transportation and Electronics) and asset valuation (Advanced Materials) perspectives.",

      "answer": "The Transportation and Electronics segment experienced a 1.0% negative currency translation impact in 2023, contributing to its overall 4.5% decline in total sales change. On page 106, 3M explains that it updated its segment performance methodology to exclude gains and losses from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and other assets, aiming to better reflect core operational performance. This change aligns with isolating currency translation effects, as both adjustments remove external or non-operational factors that could distort the evaluation of the segment's underlying business performance. The decision to exclude such items suggests 3M prioritizes evaluating the segment based on controllable, organic performance metrics rather than external market or transactional volatility.",

      "question": "How does RTX's $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in 2020 related to Collins Aerospace reconcile with the subsequent absence of this charge in 2021 and the ongoing negative impact of the pandemic on Collins Aerospace's commercial aerospace business?",
      "answer": "RTX recorded a $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in 2020 tied to two Collins Aerospace reporting units due to the adverse effects of the pandemic on the commercial aerospace industry. This charge was absent in 2021, contributing to a $2.9 billion decrease in acquisition accounting adjustments year-over-year. However, despite the absence of the impairment charge, Collins Aerospace continued to face pandemic-driven demand declines in commercial air travel, which persisted into 2021 and impacted its customer base and asset recoverability. This suggests that while the goodwill impairment was a one-time accounting recognition of the downturn, the underlying business continued to experience operational and financial stress due to reduced air travel demand.",

      "question": "How does the impact of variable labor costs on Resource Industries' profitability compare with the capital intensity of that segment as measured by depreciation and amortization in the reconciliation table?",
      "answer": "Variable labor costs, particularly freight, had an unfavorable impact on Resource Industries' profitability in 2021, contributing to increased manufacturing costs despite favorable cost absorption from rising inventory levels. This pressure was partially offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, resulting in a 44% increase in segment profit to $1.291 billion and an improvement in profit margin from 11.3% to 13.0%. Meanwhile, the capital intensity of the Resource Industries segment is reflected in its depreciation and amortization expenses, which were $403 million in 2021, down from $418 million in 2020. This relatively modest decline in depreciation suggests that the segment continues to carry a significant fixed asset base, which may contribute to ongoing cost pressures even as variable labor costs fluctuate. The combination of these views indicates that while Resource Industries is experiencing margin expansion from volume and pricing, it remains exposed to both variable cost volatility and fixed cost intensity.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "The Safety and Industrial segment reported an organic sales decline of 5.1% in 2023, which was partially offset by a negative 0.5% impact from currency translation, resulting in a total sales decline of 5.6% for the segment. This aligns with MMM's broader financial dynamics where the Total Company sales change was -5.9%, driven by a -4.3% organic sales decline and a -0.7% negative currency translation impact. The segment-level analysis reveals that Safety and Industrial underperformed relative to the company average, both in terms of organic growth and translation effects. This indicates that the segment was more adversely affected by external market and currency pressures than the company as a whole, which is further contextualized by MMM's broader segment restructuring post-Health Care spin-off, as detailed in the business segment disclosures.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGeneral Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP): As of December 31, 2024, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Company's GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "The operational risk related to Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine program, including production delays, supply chain constraints, and the July 2023 discovery of a rare powder metal issue in the PW1100G-JM engine, likely contributed to a decline in the segment's commercial aerospace sales from $13,666 million in 2022 to $11,133 million in 2023. This decline occurred despite continued strong defense and U.S. government sales ($5,206 million in 2023), suggesting that the engine program's challenges had a material negative impact on the segment's overall revenue growth and potentially its profitability. The year-over-year drop in commercial aerospace sales (-$2,533 million) contrasts with growth in other segments like Collins Aerospace, indicating a specific performance issue tied to Pratt & Whitney's execution risks.",

      "answer": "Yes, Collins' $1.2 billion increase in external product sales in 2024 contributed to RTX's overall net product sales growth, but it also played a principal role in driving a $0.3 billion increase in intersegment eliminations. This suggests that while Collins experienced meaningful external growth, a portion of its activity may be linked to internal transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation. The simultaneous rise in both external sales and intersegment eliminations indicates that Collins' growth may reflect increased internal collaboration or dependencies, which could temper the visibility into pure external demand. This dynamic highlights the importance of understanding how external growth at one segment may be intertwined with internal operational structures.",

Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax  related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\n\n## FAS/CAS operating adjustment\n\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension ex pense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "Collins Aerospace's inter-segment sales increased from $1,722 million in 2022 (page_112) to $1,959 million in 2023 (page_111), representing a 13.7% growth. Over the same period, Collins' total business segment sales rose from $23,052 million to $26,253 million, a 13.9% increase. The near-proportional growth in inter-segment sales relative to total segment sales suggests that RTX is increasingly leveraging internal collaboration and vertical integration as part of its operational strategy. This alignment indicates that inter-segment transactions are not just incidental but are strategically embedded in the company's business model to support overall segment growth.",

      "answer": "The flat performance in automotive aftermarket sales\u2014remaining at $1,235 million in 2024 compared to $1,237 million in 2023\u2014suggests that MMM was able to maintain revenue stability in this sub-segment even as broader industrial demand remained cautious. According to the narrative in the 2024 results, the Safety and Industrial segment experienced mixed end-market demand, with weaker conditions in EMEA and cautious channel behavior, yet still achieved margin expansion. This margin improvement was driven by productivity gains, spending discipline, and growth in other areas like roofing granules and industrial adhesives, despite the flat performance in automotive aftermarket. This indicates that MMM's operational improvements and cost management were sufficient to offset stagnation in a key sub-segment, highlighting strategic resilience in margin management under challenging market conditions.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "The Cat Financial segment reported long-term trade and other receivables of $33 million in 2021 and $1 million in 2020 (page 87), indicating a significant increase in receivables tied to financing activities. This exposure to long-term receivables, which are vulnerable to foreign exchange risk, aligns with the segment's reported foreign exchange contract gains of $89 million in 2021, following a loss of $112 million in 2020 (page 89). The increase in receivables suggests a larger asset base subject to currency fluctuations, which may explain the volatility in foreign exchange gains or losses. Therefore, the growth in long-term trade receivables appears to be a contributing factor to the Financial Products segment's fluctuating performance in foreign exchange contracts.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's increased research and development spending in 2023, which partially offset operational improvements in the BCA segment, reconcile with the segment's significant revenue growth driven by higher 787 deliveries?",
      "answer": "Boeing's BCA segment experienced a $7,875 million revenue increase in 2023, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries, which contributed to a reduction in the segment's loss from operations by $706 million compared to 2022. However, this improvement was partially offset by higher research and development spending, which is noted in both the operational performance section and the consolidated loss from operations analysis. While increased 787 deliveries improved revenue and operational performance, the company's strategic investment in R&D suggests a trade-off between near-term profitability and long-term product development, particularly as abnormal production costs related to the 787 program were still significant at $1,014 million in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: BA(page_32) \u2192 Higher Research and Development Spending: The BCA segment's loss from operations in 2023 was partially offset by higher R&D spending, which is explicitly called out as a negative factor despite overall operational improvements.",
        "Hop 2: Higher Research and Development Spending \u2192 BCA: The BCA segment is directly impacted by R&D spending, which is mentioned as a recurring offset to operational improvements in both 2023 and 2022, indicating a consistent strategic investment pattern.",
        "Hop 3: BCA \u2190 BA(page_26): The BCA segment saw a $7,875 million revenue increase in 2023, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries, which contrasts with the negative impact of increased R&D spending mentioned in another section."

      "answer": "The Consumer segment's translation effect contributed $11 million to its asset balance in 2021 (from the 'Translation and other' line in the segment balance table), representing a small portion of the total company's $421 million translation adjustment. In terms of sales growth, the Consumer segment's translation effect added 1.0 percentage point to its 10.3% total sales change, while the overall company saw a 1.6 percentage point translation benefit to its 10.6% total sales change.

      "answer": "The liabilities section indicates that a 5% improvement in claim severity rates would reduce self-insurance reserves by approximately $290 million. Meanwhile, the balance sheet shows that self-insurance reserves decreased from $1,085 million in 2020 to $1,048 million in 2021, a decline of $37 million. This suggests that while UPS's actuarial models indicate a significant sensitivity to changes in claim severity assumptions, the actual year-over-year decline in reserves was much smaller, potentially indicating either modest improvements in claim severity rates or offsetting increases in claim frequency or other actuarial factors that partially counterbalanced severity reductions.",

      "answer": "The Resource Industries segment reported a profit of $1.291 billion in 2021, which was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing costs, including higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight. This contrasts with the Energy & Transportation segment, where variable labor and burden costs also rose, but the segment managed to achieve a profit of $2.768 billion, albeit with a slight decline in profit margin from 13.8% to 13.6%. Despite similar cost pressures, the Resource Industries segment experienced a larger percentage increase in profitability (44%) compared to Energy & Transportation (15%), suggesting differing degrees of cost absorption and pricing power across the two segments.",

The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. End-user demand was higher in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $1.291 billion in 2021, an increase of $395 million, or 44 percent, compared with $896 million in 2020.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost absorption. Higher period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased during 2021, compared with a decrease during 2020.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor costs.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 13.0 percent for 2021, compared with 11.3 percent for 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "Union Pacific's operating ratio improved to a record 57.2%, driven in part by a positive mix of traffic. This traffic mix effect, which contributed to the 2.7-point improvement in the operating ratio, was directly tied to a 4% increase in carload volume across all key market segments. The positive mix of traffic was largely due to a relative increase in industrial shipments, which carry a higher average revenue per carload (ARC). This shift in traffic mix significantly contributed to the 11% year-over-year increase in freight revenues, demonstrating how strategic shifts in transported commodities improved both volume and pricing dynamics, ultimately supporting the company's cost-efficiency gains reflected in the operating ratio.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues  vary  with  volume  (carloads)  and  ARC.  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  drive  ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes,  are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer  incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  volumes,  and  recognized  as  the  related  performance  obligation  is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue  between  reporting  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Accessorial  revenues  are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge  revenue,  core  pricing  gains,  and  positive  mix  of  traffic  (for  example,  a  relative  increase  in  industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery  from  the  depressed  economy  brought  on  by  the  COVID  pandemic  in  2020.  While  the  markets  have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  revenues  of  $1.7  billion  and  $1.0  billion  in  2021  and  2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in  carloadings,  partially  offset  by  the  lag  impact  on  fuel  surcharge  (it  can  generally  take  up  to  two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\n\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive  production  offset  the  recovery  from  other  COVID  related  declines  in  2020.  Accessorial  revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.",

      "answer": "RTX's economic environment section on page 34 states that high inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs, negatively impacting operating profit and margin. This macroeconomic pressure is particularly problematic for fixed-price contracts where RTX cannot easily offset cost increases through pricing adjustments. The risk factor section on page 13 reinforces this by emphasizing that supplier cost pressures are expected to continue negatively affecting performance and that RTX may be unable to increase contract value or pricing on fixed-price contracts, exposing them to potential losses. Together, these sections indicate a consistent and compounding challenge where inflation-driven supplier cost increases are constraining profitability, especially under fixed-price contracts, and are expected to persist into the future.",

      "answer": "MMM reported a total sales decline of 5.0% in 2023, driven in part by a 2.8% total sales decline in the Health Care segment. However, the Health Care segment experienced 0.7% organic sales growth, which was offset by a 3.1% negative impact from divestitures. This contrasts with the broader company trend where total sales declined by 4.5% overall, and most other segments experienced more consistent declines without such a pronounced divergence between organic performance and divestiture impact. The Health Care segment's mixed performance highlights how divestitures disproportionately affected its top-line results despite underlying organic growth.",

      "answer": "The FedEx Ground Segment's goodwill balance remained unchanged at $932 million from 2023 to 2024, indicating no impairment or write-down during this period. However, the segment's contribution to consolidated operating income dropped from $1,995 million in 2023 to $1,018 million in 2024, reflecting a significant year-over-year decline in profitability. This divergence suggests that while the segment's core asset base (as represented by goodwill) remains intact, its operational performance meaningfully weakened, contributing to the overall decline in FedEx's consolidated operating income from $6,174 million to $5,176 million. This raises questions about whether the segment is underperforming relative to its asset valuation or if the decline is cyclical rather than structural.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported $1 million in Mining-related financing receivables categorized as 'Non-accrual Without an Allowance' out of a total $26 million in that category company-wide as of December 31, 2021. This indicates that the Mining segment contributes a small portion (approximately 3.8%) to the overall non-accrual without allowance risk. However, when compared to the Mining segment's $11 million in total amortized cost on page 102 (representing both pre- and post-TDR balances), this $1 million non-accrual without allowance could signal a potential credit risk concentration in a segment that already shows significant post-TDR reductions. This suggests that while Mining is not the largest source of non-accrual risk, its structural credit quality may warrant closer scrutiny.",

      "answer": "The Safety and Industrial segment reported an organic sales decline of 5.1% and a total sales change of -5.6% for 2023, contributing significantly to MMM's overall total sales change decline of 5.0%. This aligns with the broader company trend where organic sales declined by 4.7%, and total sales change was further impacted by divestitures and translation effects. The segment's performance reflects a key driver in the company's overall sales contraction, as it is one of the four major business units and experienced one of the steepest declines in sales performance.",

      "question": "How does the absence of '91+ Still Accruing' balances in Caterpillar Power Finance's portfolio in 2021 compare with its historical credit risk exposure in prior years, and what does this imply about the segment's evolving credit management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Caterpillar Power Finance had no '91+ Still Accruing' balances, a notable shift from 2020, where it reported $170 million in such balances. This absence suggests an improvement or tightening in Caterpillar Power Finance's credit management practices, as '91+ Still Accruing' balances typically indicate receivables that are significantly past due but still accruing interest. The segment\u2019s broader credit exposure, as seen in its pre- and post-TDR amortized cost data in 2021, shows a more controlled credit profile, with only $26 million pre-TDR and $22 million post-TDR balances. This implies a more conservative or selective approach to credit risk in the Caterpillar Power Finance segment during 2021 compared to the prior year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(page_101) \u2192 91+ Still Accruing: The table shows Caterpillar Power Finance had $0 in '91+ Still Accruing' balances in 2021, down from $170 million in 2020.",
        "Hop 2: 91+ Still Accruing \u2192 Caterpillar Power Finance: Caterpillar Power Finance is a segment within CAT, and the absence of '91+ Still Accruing' balances indicates a shift in credit risk posture.",
        "Hop 3: Caterpillar Power Finance \u2190 CAT(page_102): The 2021 data shows Caterpillar Power Finance had $26 million in pre-TDR and $22 million in post-TDR amortized cost, suggesting tighter credit controls and fewer delinquencies."

      "answer": "The $8 billion in Mining finance receivables reported in 2024 indicates that Caterpillar Financial has significantly increased its exposure to the Mining sector, which is a distinct class within its portfolio segment analysis. This represents a doubling from $3 billion in 2023, signaling a strategic focus on this industry. In contrast, other geographic segments like North America and EAME show more modest fluctuations. This growing concentration in Mining finance receivables highlights a potential increase in credit risk tied to this specific sector, especially considering that Cat Financial evaluates Mining receivables using loss forecast models that incorporate industry-specific economic factors. Given that total finance receivables amount to $16,180 million in 2024, the Mining segment alone accounts for nearly 50% of the total, suggesting a significant shift in credit risk composition.",

          "chunk_text": "## C. Allowance for credit losses\n\n## Portfolio segments\n\nA portfolio segment is the level at which Cat Financial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Cat Financial's portfolio segments and related methods for estimating expected credit losses are as follows:\n\n## Customer\n\nCat Financial provides loans and finance leases to end-user customers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used Caterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use.  Cat  Financial also provides financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate  Caterpillar products.  The average original term of Cat Financial's customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 51 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\n\nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Cat Financial's forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as low delinquencies  within  their  portfolio. However,  industry  delinquencies  show  an  increasing  trend  as  the  central  bank  actions  aimed  at  reducing  inflation  have weakened  global  economic  growth. The  company  believes  the  economic  forecasts  employed  represent  reasonable  and  supportable  forecasts,  followed  by  a reversion to long-term trends.\n\n## Dealer\n\nCat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans and short-term working capital loans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\n\nCat  Financial  estimates  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  dealer  finance  receivables  based  on  historical  loss  rates  with  consideration  of  current  economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\n\nIn general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## Classes of finance receivables\n\nCat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\n\n- North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\n- EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia.\n- Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\n- Mining Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.\n- Latin America Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.\n- Power Finance receivables originated worldwide related to Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.",

      "answer": "The change in Accrued Income Taxes from a net outflow of $47 million in 2022 to $218 million in 2023 indicates a significant increase in tax liabilities during the year. This increase likely reflects adjustments to the Net UTB, which stood at $884 million as of December 31, 2023, and would directly affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Net UTB is included within Accrued Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, showing that the change in Accrued Income Taxes is closely tied to the recognition and adjustment of uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $188 million accrued as of year-end. Therefore, the increased Accrued Income Taxes outflow in 2023 signals a material upward adjustment in tax liabilities, reinforcing the potential for a significant impact on the effective tax rate through the Net UTB.",

      "answer": "The decline in Construction Industries' depreciation and amortization from $245 million in 2020 to $237 million in 2021 indicates a reduction in capital investment or asset base, which coincides with an increase in the segment's total sales and revenues from $16.918 billion in 2020 to $22.106 billion in 2021. This growth in sales aligns with Caterpillar's overall consolidated sales and revenues growth of 23% in 2021, driven by higher end-user demand, favorable price realization, and changes in dealer inventories across all regions, including a significant $2.563 billion increase in total sales and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin can project growth in Aeronautics sales for 2022 despite the 2021 backlog decline because the backlog metric does not fully reflect the timing and dynamics of revenue recognition for long-term contracts. Specifically, the 2021 backlog decline was primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts, which affected orders that year. However, the Aeronautics segment projected a low-single-digit increase in 2022 sales driven by growth in F-16, F-22, and classified programs. This projection aligns with the company\u2019s revenue recognition policy, which converts backlog into revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion, typically measured by incurred costs. As risks on contracts are retired and progress is made, revenue is recognized even if backlog was temporarily reduced. Furthermore, the company expects to recognize approximately 38% of its backlog as revenue within the next 12 months, supporting the 2022 sales growth forecast despite the prior year\u2019s decline.",

We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:\n\n- Aeronautics - Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.\n- Missiles  and  Fire  Control -  Provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.\n- Rotary and Mission Systems -  Designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface  ships,  sea  and  land-based  missile  defense  systems,  radar  systems,  sea  and  air-based  mission  and  combat  systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions.\n- Space -  Engaged  in  the  research  and  development,  design,  engineering  and  production  of  satellites,  space  transportation systems,  and  strategic,  advanced  strike,  and  defensive  systems.  Space  provides  network-enabled  situational  awareness  and integrates  complex  space  and  ground  global  systems  to  help  our  customers  gather,  analyze  and  securely  distribute  critical intelligence  data.  Space  is  also  responsible  for  various  classified  systems  and  services  in  support  of  vital  national  security systems. Operating profit for our Space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our 50% ownership interest in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Our investment in ULA totaled $585 million and $691 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Selected Financial Data by Business Segment\n\nNet  sales  of  our  business  segments  in  the  following  tables  exclude  intersegment  sales  as  these  activities  are  eliminated  in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAeronautics' net sales in 2021 increased $482 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher  net  sales  of  approximately  $290  million  on  classified  contracts  due  to  higher  volume;  about  $180  million  for  the  F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower  volume  on  development  contracts;  and  about  $30  million  for  the  C-130  program  primarily  due  to  higher  volume  on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the  second  quarter  of  2021  for  performance  issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  that  was  partially  offset  by  higher  risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset  by  higher  risk  retirements  and  volume  on  sustainment  contracts.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for  the  F-16  program  due  to  higher  risk  retirements  on  sustainment  contracts  and  higher  production  volume. Adjustments  not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Aeronautics' 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit range above 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021 levels.\n\n## Missiles and Fire Control\n\nOur  MFC  business  segment  provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon  systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services;  manned  and  unmanned  ground  vehicles;  and  energy  management  solutions.  MFC's  major  programs  include  PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER\u00ae), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21\u00ae) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS).

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and  services  for  which  control  has  not  yet  transferred  to  the  customer.  It  is  converted  into  sales  in  future  periods  as  work  is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts  are  successfully  retired,  the  estimated  consideration  from  customers  may  be  reduced,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2021, our ending backlog was $135.4 billion. We expect to  recognize  approximately  38%  of  our  backlog  over  the  next  12  months  and  approximately  60%  over  the  next  24  months  as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the  contract  type. Typical  payment  terms  under  fixed-price  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government  provide  that  the  customer  pays either  performance-based  payments  (PBPs)  based  on  the  achievement  of  contract  milestones  or  progress  payments  based  on  a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented  as  a  contract  liability  on  the  balance  sheet.  The  portion  of  payments  retained  by  the  customer  until  final  contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported $126 million in financing costs in 2024, which are directly tied to the operations of Cat Financial, the company's financial services segment that provides customer leasing. Cat Financial is exposed to financial market volatility and credit risks, which could increase its cost of borrowing or reduce its access to capital markets. If Cat Financial experiences higher financing costs, this could increase Caterpillar's overall financing costs beyond the current $126 million, thereby reducing the consolidated profit before taxes of $13,373 million. Additionally, if economic conditions deteriorate, delinquencies and defaults could rise, increasing credit loss provisions and further straining profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers' ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers' decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers' liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\n\n## Failure to maintain our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\n\nEach of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies.  These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, profitability, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting.  There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.  There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\n\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium-term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature. Cat Financial also could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial's business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:\n\n- Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could increase Cat Financial's write-offs and provision for credit losses.\n- The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management's judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.\n- Cat Financial's ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n- As  Cat  Financial's  borrowing  agreements  are  primarily  with  financial  institutions,  their  ability  to  perform  in  accordance  with  any  of  our  underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.",

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax  leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax  purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fix ed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

      "question": "How does 3M's disclosure that special items affect both sales growth and operating income margins reconcile with the year-on-year margin declines in the Health Care segment despite organic growth in certain business lines like oral care and medical solutions?",
      "answer": "3M's disclosure on page 25 explains that special items impact both sales and operating income by segment, which suggests that the reported financial metrics are adjusted for non-recurring or strategic costs. On page 32, the Health Care segment shows organic sales growth in oral care and medical solutions, yet operating income margins declined year-on-year due to manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, inflation impacts, restructuring costs, and investments in the business. The reconciliation lies in understanding that while organic growth in these lines contributed positively to sales, the special items\u2014such as restructuring and spin-off preparation costs\u2014negatively impacted margins. Furthermore, aggressive spending discipline and pricing actions partially offset these pressures, but not enough to prevent margin contraction. This dynamic illustrates how special items can mask underlying operational performance, aligning the sales growth narrative with the margin pressure observed in the segment.",

      "answer": "The $1,098 million of wholesale inventory receivables held by Cat Financial at the end of 2021, as disclosed in the Receivables - Trade and Other category, represents a significant portion of the Financial Products segment's asset base. This segment also reported $89 million in foreign exchange contract gains in 2021. Given that these receivables are exposed to foreign exchange risk, the gains may reflect the segment's use of foreign exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations affecting these receivables. The Financial Products segment's active use of foreign exchange contracts, as shown in the gains, aligns with its role in financing international dealer transactions, which would naturally expose it to currency risk from these receivables.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Mining segment contributed $8 million to the company's total non-accrual financing receivables with allowance reserves of $184 million as of December 31, 2022. This represents approximately 4.3% of the total reserves. The segment-specific reserve for Mining is relatively modest compared to larger contributors like Latin America ($52 million) and North America ($47 million), indicating that while mining receivables are part of Caterpillar's credit risk profile, they represent a smaller portion of the overall non-accrual reserves.",

        "Hop 1: CAT(page_102) \u2192 Mining: Caterpillar's Mining segment is one of several geographic/segment categories listed in the financing receivables table, with $8 million in non-accrual with allowance reserves as of December 31, 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Mining \u2192 Non-accrual With an Allowance: The Mining segment's $8 million in non-accrual with allowance reserves is directly linked to the broader category of non-accrual financing receivables with allowance, which includes reserves across all segments.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Domestic Package segment achieved double-digit revenue per piece growth in 2021, driven by base rate increases, favorable customer and product mix, and demand-related surcharges. These surcharges were introduced in Q2 2020 due to pandemic-related capacity constraints and remained elevated into 2022, directly contributing to the 14.4% total revenue per piece increase for the year. However, UPS expects revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022, suggesting that while the surcharges significantly boosted pricing power during the pandemic, their continued application may not be sufficient to sustain the same level of growth as market conditions normalize. Thus, the segment's ability to maintain revenue growth will likely depend on a combination of continued pricing discipline, product mix optimization, and base rate increases beyond the temporary surcharge impact.",

          "chunk_text": "## Employee health and safety\n\nWe are committed to industry-leading employee health, safety and wellness programs across our growing workforce. We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

          "chunk_text": "\n- Revenue increased in all segments, with double digit revenue per piece growth in both U.S. Domestic Package and International Package.\n- Average daily package volume increases were driven by growth in SMB and business-to-business volume.\n- Operating expenses increased, primarily driven by fuel and third-party transportation costs.\n- Operating profit and operating margin increased in global small package and Supply Chain Solutions.\n- We reported net income of $12.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $14.68. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Volume\n\nAverage daily volume increased for both domestic and export products, with growth primarily in the first half of the year. Volume declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the year-over-year impacts of COVID-19 on consumer behavior. For the year, we experienced growth from both SMBs and large customers, primarily in the retail, manufacturing and technology sectors. Business-to-business volume increased 10.8% as commercial activity largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Business-toconsumer volume increased 5.1%, with growth primarily in the first quarter when COVID-19 driven volume was not present in the comparative period. We expect overall volume growth to accelerate in 2022.\n\nExport volume increased for the year, led by Europe and the Americas, while Asia volume was largely unchanged. Volume growth was strongest on intra-Europe trade lanes, as well as from Europe and the Americas to the United States. Trade between Europe and the United Kingdom declined throughout the year as a result of Brexit, which became effective on January 1, 2021. Asia export volume grew significantly in the first quarter, but was then impacted in the second quarter by a reduction in shipments of personal protective equipment relative to 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 impacts within the region reduced the number of flights operated in the second half of the year.\n\nPremium products saw volume growth of 14.9%, driven by Worldwide Express and Transborder Express products. Volume for non-premium products increased 6.9%, driven by growth in our Transborder Standard product. Worldwide Standard volume increased primarily as a result of Brexit, with shipments between the United Kingdom and the European Union that are now subject to duties and taxes shifting from Transborder to Worldwide products.\n\nDomestic volume increased for the year in many markets, with the strongest growth in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 on business-to-consumer demand. During the fourth quarter, domestic volume declined, driven by a reduction in e-commerce resulting in fewer residential deliveries, that was slightly offset by growth in commercial volume.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nIn December 2020, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the United States. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. In response to capacity constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to apply demand-related surcharges on certain lanes in the second quarter of 2020. These surcharges are expected to remain elevated in 2022.\n\nTotal revenue per piece increased 14.4%, driven by changes in base pricing, fuel and demand-related surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix. Currency movements contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year, but had a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 12.0% for the year.\n\nExport revenue per piece increased 15.1% as a result of the factors described above. Excluding the impact of currency movements, export revenue per piece increased 13.2%.\n\nDomestic revenue per piece increased 9.9% due to changes in base pricing, fuel surcharges and customer and product mix. Although currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in the fourth quarter, they contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue per piece increased 5.6%.\n\nWe expect revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nThe fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the U.S. is largely indexed to the DOE's Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the U.S. are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates.\n\nWhile fluctuations can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges and any pricing discounts offered. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $866 million, primarily due to increases in fuel surcharge indices, as well as overall volume growth and changes in customer and product mix.",

      "question": "How does Transportation and Electronics' 2021 sales growth of 10.6% reconcile with the relatively modest 1.6% contribution from currency translation, given that organic growth was already 9.0%?",
      "answer": "The Transportation and Electronics segment reported 2021 sales of $9,769 million, reflecting a 10.6% total sales increase. This growth was driven by 9.0% organic growth, with an additional 1.6% coming from favorable currency translation effects. Despite the modest translation impact, the segment achieved strong overall growth due to robust underlying demand. This suggests that external macroeconomic factors like currency movements had a limited but positive influence compared to the core business performance.",

      "answer": "Resource Industries' profit margin improved from 11.3% in 2020 to 13.0% in 2021 despite rising manufacturing costs, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. This occurred alongside a depreciation and amortization expense of $403 million in 2021, which is significantly higher than Construction Industries' $237 million. While both segments faced increased manufacturing costs, Resource Industries was able to offset these more effectively through volume growth and pricing power, leading to a stronger margin improvement despite higher fixed cost absorption from depreciation.

The  decrease  was  due  to  lower  average  debt  outstanding  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- Other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2021 was income of $1.063 billion, compared with expense of $309 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The change was primarily driven by mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 22.9 percent, compared with  27.8  percent  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  excluding  the  discrete  items  discussed  in  the  following  paragraph.  The decrease from 2020 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2021 also included the following:\n\n- A  tax  benefit  of  $118  million  for  the  change  from  the  third-quarter  estimated  annual  tax  rate  of  25  percent, compared to a $96 million benefit for the reduction in the annual effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- A tax charge of $190 million related to $833 million of pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a $92 million tax benefit related to $438 million of mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- A tax benefit of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily related to recognition of U.S. capital losses compared to $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nConstruction Industries' total sales were $5.736 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.228 billion, or 27 percent, compared with $4.508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand, along with favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n- In North America, sales increased due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Higher sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n- Sales  increased  in  Latin  America  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization.  Higher  sales volume  was  driven  by  higher  end-user  demand  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories.  Dealers  increased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a decrease during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- In EAME, sales increased due to higher sales volume from higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n- Sales  decreased  in  Asia/Pacific  primarily  due  to  lower  sales  volume,  partially  offset  by  favorable  price  realization. Decreased  sales  volume  reflected  lower  end-user  demand,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer inventories. Lower sales in China, driven by lower end-user demand, were partially offset by higher sales across most of the rest of the region. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit was $788 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $158 million, or 25 percent, compared with $630 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization.  Increased  manufacturing  costs  reflected  higher  variable  labor  and  burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 14.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.",

The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. End-user demand was higher in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $1.291 billion in 2021, an increase of $395 million, or 44 percent, compared with $896 million in 2020.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost absorption.

      "answer": "Boeing's accounting treatment for long-term contracts, particularly the judgment-driven estimation process for revenue and cost recognition, led to significant volatility in reported earnings. In 2021, BCA recorded a $3.46 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program, contributing to its overall operating loss. This financial strain was compounded by the 737 MAX-related legal settlements, including a $2.51 billion Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DOJ in 2021, which required immediate cash outlays and prior period accruals.

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Policies &amp; Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially  all  contracts  at  BDS  and  certain  contracts  at  BGS  are  long-term  contracts.  Our  long-term  contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these  estimates  include  inflationary trends,  technical  and  schedule  risk,  internal  and  subcontractor performance  trends,  business  volume  assumptions,  COVID-19  disruptions,  asset  utilization  and  anticipated  labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly.  Changes  in  these  estimates  could  result  in  recognition  of  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  the performance obligation's inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by  $880  million,  $942  million  and  $111  million,  respectively.  The  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  in  2021  were primarily  due  to  losses  recognized  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker,  VC-25B  and  Commercial  Crew  programs.  These  are  all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue  to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process  described  above,  it  is  likely  that  materially  different earnings  could  be  recorded  if  we  used  different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change. Changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  or  circumstances  may  adversely  or  positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term  production  effort  for  delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated contracts.  The  determination  of  the  accounting  quantity  is  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable estimates.",

See pages 49 - 51.\n\nLoss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS. BCA loss from operations decreased by $7,372 million primarily due to the absence of a $6,493  million  reach-forward  loss  on  the  777X  program  recorded  in  2020,  lower  period  expenses,  lower  737  MAX customer considerations and higher 737 MAX deliveries, partially offset by a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

      "answer": "In 2024, MMM's Safety and Industrial segment reported organic sales growth in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, contrasting with a decline in 2023 due to consumer electronics softness and reduced e-commerce shipments. Specifically, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes sales were $2,104 million in 2024, up from $2,051 million in 2023 but down from $2,220 million in 2022. This suggests that while MMM regained some momentum in this category in 2024, it still hasn't returned to the 2022 sales level, indicating potential market challenges or competitive pressures that persisted despite broader recovery trends.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "question": "Given the increase in intersegment sales for Rotary and Mission Systems to $2,125 million in 2023, how should investors interpret the segment's reported operating profit, considering that such sales are eliminated in consolidation and certain unallocated corporate costs are not included in segment evaluations?",
      "answer": "Investors should interpret the reported operating profit of the Rotary and Mission Systems segment with caution due to two key factors. First, the segment's intersegment sales increased to $2,125 million in 2023, which are entirely eliminated in consolidation, meaning they do not contribute to Lockheed Martin\u2019s consolidated revenue or profit. Second, segment operating profit excludes several unallocated items such as legal fees, pension adjustments, and corporate costs that are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment performance. Therefore, while the segment may appear profitable based on its standalone results, the true economic contribution to the company may be influenced by these excluded costs and internal dependencies, suggesting a need for deeper scrutiny of consolidated financials before applying valuation multiples.",

        "Hop 1: [LMT](page_75) \u2192 [Rotary and Mission Systems]: Segment assets are reported at $17,521 million, indicating its material size and operational importance.",

        "Hop 3: [Intersegment Sales] \u2190 [LMT](page_72): Intersegment sales are excluded from consolidated results, and segment profit excludes unallocated corporate costs, suggesting that segment-level profitability may not reflect consolidated performance."

      "answer": "The Aerospace segment reported $2,314 million in total R&D spending in 2023, the highest of any segment, with $1,006 million funded directly by GE. This significant investment coincides with a rise in equity method income from Aerospace to $295 million in 2023, up from $149 million in 2022. The growth in equity income suggests that GE's R&D funding in Aerospace is contributing to stronger performance in its equity method investments. This alignment implies that R&D spending may be enhancing the value of joint ventures or partnerships within the Aerospace segment, supporting GE\u2019s strategic positioning in advanced aerospace technologies.",

      "question": "How does General Dynamics' allocation of $19.286 billion in identifiable assets to the Technologies segment align with its facility ownership strategy, particularly given the segment's relatively small 2.2 million square feet of company-owned facilities compared to other business units?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics allocated $19.286 billion in identifiable assets to the Technologies segment in 2024, which is a significant investment. However, the company owns only 2.2 million square feet of facilities for this segment, the smallest among all business units. This suggests a strategic preference for leasing or relying on government-owned facilities rather than heavy capital investment in owned infrastructure. This contrasts with segments like Aerospace and Marine Systems, which have larger company-owned footprints, indicating different capital deployment strategies across the business. This approach may enhance operational flexibility and reduce fixed costs for the Technologies segment despite its substantial asset base.",

      "question": "How does the increase in intersegment sales to the Aeronautics segment in 2023 compared to 2022 reflect on Lockheed Martin's overall segment operating performance, considering the exclusion of intersegment sales from consolidated operating results?",
      "answer": "The increase in intersegment sales to the Aeronautics segment from $249 million in 2022 to $303 million in 2023 indicates growing internal collaboration or dependency on other segments for Aeronautics' operations. However, since intersegment sales are excluded from consolidated and segment operating results, this growth does not directly contribute to Lockheed Martin's reported operating profit. Instead, it highlights a shift in how internal business activities support Aeronautics, which operates within a broader context of Lockheed Martin's four business segments. This dynamic must be considered when evaluating the segment's standalone performance, as the operating profit figures exclude these internal transactions, potentially masking the true extent of interdependencies that support external revenue generation.",

        "Hop 1: [LMT](page_72) \u2192 [Intersegment Sales]: Discloses that intersegment sales are excluded from consolidated and segment operating results as they are eliminated in consolidation.",

        "Hop 3: [Aeronautics] \u2190 [LMT](page_61): Aeronautics is identified as one of Lockheed Martin's four key business segments, operating within a structure where intersegment dynamics influence performance but are not reflected in final operating profit."

This decline was partly due to higher material costs, which also contributed to unfavorable manufacturing costs at the consolidated level. At the company level, material cost increases were cited as a key factor in the $2.325 billion operating profit increase being partially offset, suggesting that while Resource Industries was particularly affected, rising material costs were a systemic challenge impacting overall profitability trends.",

The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020.

This estimation risk is especially relevant given that the total backlog across all segments was $87.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, with a substantial portion coming from defense contracts. The backlog includes both funded and unfunded portions, and the company relies on assumptions about future funding and performance to estimate the value of work to be performed.

          "chunk_text": "## Estimation of costs at completion for select long-term contracts\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  B  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  accounting  for  long-term  contracts involves estimation of the costs to complete a contract in order to accurately recognize the associated revenue.  The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021. These balances resulted in a net liability of $2.6 billion. The pension benefit obligation is the estimated  present  value  of  future  pension  benefits  attributed  to  employee  services  rendered  to  date, including assumptions about future compensation levels.

On December 31, 2021, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace segment was $1.7 billion.\n\nDemand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and privately held companies, individuals, and governments around the world. Geographically, U.S. customers represented approximately 70% of the segment's orders in 2021 and 57% of the segment's backlog on December 31, 2021, demonstrating continued strong domestic demand.\n\nThe following represents Gulfstream aircraft (in units) in backlog by region on December 31, 2021:\n\n## DEFENSE SEGMENTS\n\nThe  total  backlog  in  our  defense  segments  represents  the  estimated  remaining  sales  value  of  work  to  be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and  appropriated  by  the  U.S.  Congress  and  funded  by  customers,  as  well  as  commitments  by  international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. The unfunded portion of total backlog includes  the  amounts  we  believe  are  likely  to  be  funded,  but  there  is  no  guarantee  that  future  budgets  and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program.\n\nEstimated  potential  contract  value  in  our  defense  segments  includes  unexercised  options  associated  with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)",

      "answer": "The FedEx Freight segment contributed $461 million of the consolidated total $5,176 million in operating income for 2024, representing approximately 8.9%. Despite being one of four major operating segments\u2014specifically focused on LTL (less-than-truckload) freight transportation\u2014its financial contribution is notably smaller compared to segments like FedEx Express ($3,291 million) and FedEx Ground ($1,018 million). This suggests that while FedEx Freight plays a specialized role in the company's logistics portfolio, it is not a dominant driver of overall operating income.",

      "question": "Given UPS's strategic focus on business-to-business volume as a growth driver for the International Package segment, how does the segment's double-digit revenue per piece growth reconcile with the expense pressures from higher fuel prices and third-party transportation costs?",
      "answer": "UPS's strategic focus on business-to-business volume, emphasized in the overview of the International Package segment, aligns with the reported volume growth driven by B2B demand. This growth contributed to double-digit revenue per piece increases, supported by base rate increases, favorable customer mix, and fuel and demand-related surcharges. However, the segment also experienced significant expense pressures, primarily from higher fuel prices and third-party transportation costs, which were exacerbated by volume growth. While revenue growth outpaced cost increases\u2014leading to improved operating profit and margin\u2014this dynamic raises questions about the sustainability of margin expansion if input cost inflation persists without corresponding pricing power. The strategic emphasis on B2B volume thus appears to be delivering revenue growth, but its profitability impact is contingent on cost containment and pricing discipline.",

Our services include transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage and insurance.\n\nWe operate one of the largest airlines and one of the largest fleets of alternative fuel vehicles under a global UPS brand. We deliver packages each business day for approximately 1.7 million shipping customers to 11.8 million delivery customers in over 220 countries and territories. In 2021, we delivered an average of 25.2 million packages per day, totaling 6.4 billion packages during the year. Total revenue in 2021 was $97.3 billion.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur well-defined strategy focuses on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including business-to-business (\"B2B\"), healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") and large enterprise accounts. We are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy as we transform our business.\n\nCustomer First is about reducing the friction of doing business. We help our customers seize new opportunities, compete, and succeed by delivering the capabilities that they tell us matter the most: speed and ease.\n\nPeople Led specifically focuses on how likely an employee is to recommend UPS employment to a friend or family member. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture, so we are striving to make UPS a great place to work. Through our transformation initiatives, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. We are also enhancing the employee value proposition to align with evolving market practices.\n\nInnovation Driven is designed to optimize the volume that flows through our network, to focus on increasing value share and driving business growth from higher-yielding opportunities in our target markets. We are using technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network. In our United States (\" U.S.\") Domestic Package segment, our aim is to improve revenue mix and lower our cost to serve. Within the International Package segment and Supply Chain Solutions businesses, we are focused on value share gains and growing operating profit.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "RTX's consolidated net sales for 2020 were $56,587 million, with the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment contributing $10,141 million. This segment's sales were composed of $4,526 million from fixed-price contracts and $5,615 million from cost-type contracts. The Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment's contribution highlights its significant role within RTX's overall revenue structure, particularly through its reliance on both fixed-price and cost-type contracts. This composition suggests a balanced approach to contract types, which may influence the segment\u2019s financial performance and risk exposure.",

      "answer": "Raytheon Missiles & Defense's net sales grew from $11,396 million in 2020 to $15,539 million in 2021, driven by increased contributions from both U.S. government contracts and foreign military sales. In 2021, the segment reported $9,493 million in U.S. government sales and $3,280 million in foreign military sales through the U.S. government, indicating that combined U.S. and foreign military channels accounted for $12,773 million of its $15,539 million in total business segment sales.

      "question": "How does the 5% decrease in Maintenance and Repairs Expense at FedEx Express in 2024 reconcile with the 10% increase in the same metric at FedEx Ground, especially considering that both segments are now consolidated under Federal Express as part of the company's one FedEx strategy?",
      "answer": "The 5% decrease in Maintenance and Repairs Expense at FedEx Express in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in aircraft temporarily parked, reflecting reduced operations and cost-cutting measures under the DRIVE initiatives. In contrast, FedEx Ground experienced a 10% increase in this expense, driven by higher costs associated with outside vendor labor, vehicle parts, and facility maintenance, as the segment expanded its operations following multi-year infrastructure projects. This divergence in trends is notable as both segments are now part of Federal Express following the June 1, 2024 consolidation under the one FedEx strategy. This strategic integration suggests that while cost management remains a priority, the operational dynamics and investment needs of each segment post-merger are distinct, with FedEx Ground requiring more capital-intensive maintenance support compared to the downsizing seen in FedEx Express.",

In 2022, the 'Other Corporate Expense-Net' was reported at $176 million, indicating the financial impact of unallocated corporate costs, including philanthropy, on the company's overall operating income.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n## Elimination of Dual Credit\n\n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional ('dual') credit to another business segment when the customer account activity ('sales district') with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled 'Elimination of Dual Credit,' such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\n\n",

The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M's effective ownership is 75 percent.\n\n## PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\nItem 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M's business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M's business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated:\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to 'Corporate and Unallocated,' which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products/businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments.

      "answer": "The 2021 operating profit margin of 2.5% for the Pratt & Whitney segment, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic's effects on commercial aerospace demand, contrasts with RTX's overall consolidated operating profit margin of 7.7% in the same year. This indicates that despite Pratt & Whitney's relatively low profitability, other segments such as Collins Aerospace, Raytheon Intelligence & Space, and Raytheon Missiles & Defense likely contributed stronger margins that elevated the overall consolidated margin. The consolidated margin of 7.7% suggests a diversified recovery across RTX's business segments, even as the Pratt & Whitney segment remained under pressure.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures.

This rise in cost is directly tied to operational challenges faced by Pratt & Whitney, including the Powder Metal Matter, which required accelerated inspections and increased engine removals, shop visits, and costs. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine production ramp-up, involving significant manufacturing and supply chain demands, further contributed to these cost pressures.

      "answer": "The increase in Total Transformation Strategy Costs from $348 million in 2020 to $380 million in 2021 was primarily driven by a $42 million (32.6%) rise in 'Other expenses' as detailed on page 43. This increase was partially offset by reductions in 'Compensation' ($4 million decrease) and 'Other occupancy' ($5 million decrease). Page 160 confirms the overall increase in Total Transformation Strategy Costs and also shows that 'Compensation and benefits' slightly declined from $211 million in 2020 to $206 million in 2021, reinforcing the trend of cost optimization in some areas. Thus, the growth in Total Transformation Strategy Costs was concentrated in 'Other expenses', signaling a shift in where transformation-related spending was being allocated.",

International  trav el  also  surpassed  pre-pandemic  lev els  during  2024  and  the  wide-body  market  continues  to  improv e  with  the international trav el recov ery. T he transition in the international commercial market from recov ery to normal market conditions is continuing to progress as China international trav el remains below 2019 lev els. We are experiencing strong demand from our airline customers globally.\n\nWe and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. T hese factors hav e reduced ov erall productiv ity and adv ersely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAirline  financial  performance,  which  influences  demand  for  new  capacity,  has  benefited  from  the  resilient  demand  for  trav el.  T he  International  Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2024 industry-wide net profits of $31.5 billion, up from its forecast of $25.7 billion a year ago, primarily driv en by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2025, IATA is forecasting $36.6 billion in net profits for the industry globally. The ov erall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the env ironment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and v olatile costs. The global economy is expecting a continued easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial v iability of some airlines and regions.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positiv e due to the fundamental driv ers of air trav el demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to trav el due to increased trade, globalization and improv ed airline serv ices driv en by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.2% growth rate in the global fleet ov er a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6%  in  av erage  annual  gross  domestic  product,  we  project  demand  for  approximately  43,975  new  airplanes  ov er  the  next  20  years.  T he  industry remains vulnerable to exogenous dev elopments including fuel price spikes, potential new or increased tariffs, changing energy policies, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global env ironmental regulations.\n\nAt BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and serv ices hav e in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S.,  we  are  seeing  similar  solid  demand  as  gov ernments  prioritize  security,  defense  technology  and  global  cooperation  giv en  ev olv ing  threats.  We continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price dev elopment programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.\n\nAt BGS, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recov ered and transitions to growth. The demand outlook for our gov ernment serv ices business remains stable.",

The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, ov erhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs.  Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account sev eral factors that are indicativ e of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospectiv e customers and market studies. T otal estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undeliv ered units under contract. T he sales prices for all  undeliv ered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation  adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly,  as  well  as  customer consideration driv en by deliv ery delays. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic  projections.  Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  the  timing  of  production  rate  increases, internal  and  supplier  performance  trends,  production  quality,  labor  instability,  supply  chain  delays  and  quality  issues,  learning  curv e,  change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues inv olv ing  completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. Certain production rate increases require regulatory approv al. For example, during 2024, the FAA communicated it will not approv e production rate increases for the 737 program beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. If we are unable to increase production rates consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.\n\nThe introduction of new aircraft and deriv ativ es, such as the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10, inv olv es increased risks associated with meeting dev elopment, certification, and production schedules. T hese challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all dev elopment aircraft. We hav e experienced significant  certification  delays  with  the  777X ,  737-7  and  737-10  aircraft. As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliv er  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and reliability standards and achiev e or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification processes for the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10 models and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nT o  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  rev iewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  T his  includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospectiv e basis; howev er, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inv entory exceed estimated rev enues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undeliv ered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 777X  and 767 programs recognized earnings charges totaling $3,499 million and $580 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Adv erse changes to the rev enue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in further earnings charges in future periods. Lower production rates and the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement as well as pay enhancements for certain other non-union employees hav e also pressured margins on other commercial airplane programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins.

      "answer": "LMT's backlog decreased in 2021 due to prolonged negotiations on F-35 production contracts, which delayed orders and impacted the overall value of unfulfilled performance obligations. Despite this, the Aeronautics segment projected a low-single-digit increase in net sales for 2022, driven by growth in F-16, F-22, and classified programs. This suggests that while the F-35 program faced near-term headwinds, LMT's Aeronautics business maintained a diversified portfolio with sufficient momentum in other key programs to support revenue growth.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and  services  for  which  control  has  not  yet  transferred  to  the  customer.  It  is  converted  into  sales  in  future  periods  as  work  is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts  are  successfully  retired,  the  estimated  consideration  from  customers  may  be  reduced,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2021, our ending backlog was $135.4 billion. We expect to  recognize  approximately  38%  of  our  backlog  over  the  next  12  months  and  approximately  60%  over  the  next  24  months  as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the  contract  type. Typical  payment  terms  under  fixed-price  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government  provide  that  the  customer  pays either  performance-based  payments  (PBPs)  based  on  the  achievement  of  contract  milestones  or  progress  payments  based  on  a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented  as  a  contract  liability  on  the  balance  sheet.  The  portion  of  payments  retained  by  the  customer  until  final  contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.",

The increase was primarily attributable to higher  net  sales  of  approximately  $290  million  on  classified  contracts  due  to  higher  volume;  about  $180  million  for  the  F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower  volume  on  development  contracts;  and  about  $30  million  for  the  C-130  program  primarily  due  to  higher  volume  on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the  second  quarter  of  2021  for  performance  issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  that  was  partially  offset  by  higher  risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset  by  higher  risk  retirements  and  volume  on  sustainment  contracts.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for  the  F-16  program  due  to  higher  risk  retirements  on  sustainment  contracts  and  higher  production  volume. Adjustments  not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Aeronautics' 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume.

      "answer": "Boeing disclosed $498 million in 737 MAX customer considerations in 2020, which were part of broader abnormal production and compensation costs tied to the 737 MAX grounding. This figure is directly linked to the larger $1,770 million payment made to airline customers under the DOJ Deferred Prosecution Agreement in 2021, indicating that the customer considerations extended beyond initial estimates and were a significant component of the legal and financial fallout from the 737 MAX crisis. The inclusion of these payments within BCA's operational losses highlights the severe financial strain the grounding placed on the commercial airplane segment, contributing to a $13,847 million loss from operations in 2020. This synthesis reveals that the grounding not only disrupted production and delivery schedules but also triggered substantial legal and compensatory liabilities that materially impacted BCA's profitability.",

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform.

All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

      "answer": "GE has explicitly quantified its indemnification liability to GE HealthCare at $81 million under the Tax Matters Agreement, which is fully reserved, indicating a known financial exposure tied to the separation. However, the company acknowledges uncertainty regarding the market value of its common stock post-separation, noting that the new independent entities may experience increased volatility due to reduced diversification and higher operational and financial risks. While the indemnification liability is a fixed and reserved obligation, the unpredictability of how the market will value the newly independent companies introduces a layer of financial and strategic risk for investors. This dynamic suggests that although GE has addressed certain direct financial obligations, the broader implications of the separation\u2014such as market perception, investor confidence, and stock performance\u2014remain speculative and could amplify investor concerns about long-term value retention.",

      "question": "Given Caterpillar Power Finance's $22 million in post-TDR amortized cost for non-accrual loans without an allowance in 2021, how does this credit risk exposure compare to the segment's total post-TDR amortized cost of $26 million, and what does this suggest about the effectiveness of Caterpillar's credit risk management practices for this segment?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar Power Finance reported a total post-TDR amortized cost of $26 million for its loan portfolio in 2021, of which $22 million was categorized as non-accrual loans without an allowance (page 101). This means that 84.6% ($22M / $26M) of the segment's post-TDR loans carried the highest credit risk category, where no allowance was deemed sufficient to cover potential losses. This high proportion suggests potential weaknesses in Caterpillar's credit risk management practices for this segment, as a large portion of their restructured loans were considered so risky that they were not only non-accrual but also lacked any allowance to mitigate potential defaults. The lack of allowance indicates management's limited confidence in recovering these loans, raising concerns about underwriting standards or economic pressures affecting borrowers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(page_102) \u2192 Caterpillar Power Finance: The segment's post-TDR amortized cost is $22 million in 2021, representing the total non-accrual loans without an allowance.",
        "Hop 2: Caterpillar Power Finance \u2192 Non-accrual Without an Allowance: This segment holds the highest proportion of the company's non-accrual loans without an allowance, indicating significant credit risk.",
        "Hop 3: Non-accrual Without an Allowance \u2190 CAT(page_101): The disclosure reveals that $26 million is the total post-TDR amortized cost for the segment, of which $22 million has no allowance, highlighting a concentrated credit risk exposure."

      "answer": "GE's reported $9.2 billion increase in RPO at Aviation as of December 31, 2021, primarily from engines under long-term service agreements now in service, indicates strong contracted future revenue. However, the Aviation segment simultaneously reported an equity method investment loss of $41 million for the same year. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the timing mismatch between contract value (RPO) and current earnings realization\u2014while RPO reflects long-term contracted commitments, the equity method investment loss highlights short-term financial pressures. This suggests that despite a growing backlog, market conditions or operational execution challenges in 2021 limited near-term profitability realization from these agreements.",

The reduction in Commercial Services reflects lower anticipated engine utilization, the cancellation of equipment unit orders, customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. Power decreased due to sales outpacing new orders; Healthcare decreased with the disposition of the BioPharma business of $1.2 billion; and Renewable Energy increased due to new orders outpacing sales.\n\n",

      "answer": "The Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment reported an increase in operating profit from $1,615 million in 2020 to $1,798 million in 2021, reflecting a $183 million growth. However, the company also disclosed that RMS was directly impacted in 2021 by severance and restructuring charges of $36 million related to facility closures and workforce reductions within that segment. This indicates that despite these operational headwinds, RMS still managed to grow its operating profit, suggesting underlying operational improvements or cost management strategies that offset part of the negative impact. The reconciliation highlights how segment-level profitability can grow even in the face of restructuring costs that reduce consolidated operating profit.",

(a)\n\nThe impact of our postretirement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to fluctuate. Accordingly, our net earnings were affected by a net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $668 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $1.0 billion in 2018, and $876 million in 2017. We made no pension contributions in 2021, $1.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019, $5.0 billion in 2018, and $46 million in 2017. These contributions caused fluctuations in our operating cash flows and cash balance between each of those years. See 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. (b)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders' equity. (c)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include unrealized gains of $265 million ($199 million, or $0.72 per share, after-tax) due to changes in the fair value of investments held in the Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. (d)\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, operating profit includes noncash asset impairment charges of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) and $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) related to our equity method investee, (e)",

      "answer": "The 12.6% increase in identifiable assets for the Aerospace segment suggests growing investment in this business unit, yet the MD&A section reveals that supply chain challenges constrained production ramp-up despite strong customer demand for aircraft. This indicates a potential misalignment between asset growth and operational execution capacity, as increased investment hasn't translated into proportional production efficiency gains, with out-of-sequence manufacturing contributing to higher costs. The $235M in capital expenditures for Aerospace in 2024 appears aimed at expanding capacity, but supply chain limitations and external factors like Middle East conflicts affecting supplier deliveries have hindered optimal utilization of these assets.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(Dollars in millions, ex cept per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\nFor an overview of our operating segm ents, including a discussion of our m ajor products and services, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 com pared with 2023 should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statem ents included in Item  8, while a discussion of 2023 com pared with 2022 can be found in Item  7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GLOBAL EVENTS\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global econom ies and governm ent activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally , in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries im posed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus. Lastly , the im pact of the conflict in the Middle East continues to evolve. The disruptions caused by these events continue to im pact global econom ies and businesses, including ours. The prim ary im pact to our business is supply chain challenges, including availability of parts, quality escapes and inflationary pressures.\n\nIn our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges paced our ability to ram p up production at the rate we like in response to strong custom er demand for our aircraft, causing out-of-sequence m anufacturing that increased costs and decreased operational efficiency . In addition, the conflict in the Middle East im pacted the delivery schedule for our Israel-based supplier of m id-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segm ents, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges that continue to im pact our Marine System s segm ent. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment have created additional dem and for certain of our products and services, particularly in our Com bat System s segm ent.\n\nAny longer-term impact of these global events to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around duration and their broader i m pact. For additional inform ation, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item  1A.\n\n## OUR MARKETS\n\nWith approximately 70% of our revenue from the U.S. government, government spending levels  - particularly defense spending - influence our fi n an ci al   perf orm an ce.  The  Congress  has  not  yet  passed  a  defense  appropriations  bill  for  the  governm ent's  current  fiscal  year.  However,  the government has been operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding for som e federal agencies through March 14, 2025.

      "question": "How does the reduction in backlog caused by prolonged F-35 production contract negotiations constrain Lockheed Martin's ability to grow international sales in the Aeronautics segment, given the program's global customer base and multi-year production outlook?",
      "answer": "The reduction in backlog in 2021 was primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts, which led to lower orders (Hop2). This is significant because international customers accounted for 35% of Aeronautics' net sales in 2021, with the F-35 program being a central driver of international interest, including commitments from seven partner countries and six international customers (Hop3). Given that the F-35 program is expected to continue for many years with a U.S. inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft and ongoing international demand, any delays or constraints in contract negotiations directly impact the segment\u2019s ability to capitalize on international growth opportunities (Hop3). Thus, the backlog reduction not only reflects current-year order delays but also signals potential limitations in leveraging the program\u2019s global demand to drive sustained international sales growth (Hop1).",

          "chunk_text": "\nAeronautics' net sales in 2021 increased $482 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher  net  sales  of  approximately  $290  million  on  classified  contracts  due  to  higher  volume;  about  $180  million  for  the  F-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower sustainment volume; approximately $75 million for the F-35 program primarily due to higher volume on production and sustainment contracts that was partially offset by lower  volume  on  development  contracts;  and  about  $30  million  for  the  C-130  program  primarily  due  to  higher  volume  on production contracts and higher risk retirements on sustainment activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $170 million for lower sustainment volume for the F-22 program.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in 2021 decreased $44 million, or 2%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $120 million for classified contracts primarily due to a $225 million loss recognized in the  second  quarter  of  2021  for  performance  issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  that  was  partially  offset  by  higher  risk retirements on other classified programs recognized in the second half of 2021; and about $70 million for the F-35 program due to lower risk retirements and volume on development contracts and lower risk retirements on production contracts that were partially offset  by  higher  risk  retirements  and  volume  on  sustainment  contracts.  These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of approximately $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher risk retirements on sustainment contracts; and about $50 million for  the  F-16  program  due  to  higher  risk  retirements  on  sustainment  contracts  and  higher  production  volume. Adjustments  not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $60 million lower in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Aeronautics' 2022 net sales to increase in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by growth in F-16, F-22 and classified volume. Operating profit is expected to increase in the low-single digit range above 2021 levels. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021 levels.\n\n## Missiles and Fire Control\n\nOur  MFC  business  segment  provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon  systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services;  manned  and  unmanned  ground  vehicles;  and  energy  management  solutions.  MFC's  major  programs  include  PAC-3, THAAD, Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Hellfire, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER\u00ae), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21\u00ae) and Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS).

The measure increases the debt limit to $31.4 trillion from the previous level of $28.9 trillion and is estimated to provide sufficient government borrowing capacity to last until early 2023.\n\n## International Business\n\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening  our  relationships  internationally  through  partnerships  and  joint  technology  efforts.  Our  international  business  is conducted either by foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2021, approximately 69% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 31% were DCS. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  35%  of  Aeronautics'  net  sales.  There  continues  to  be  strong  international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and six international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of international expansion  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment  include  the  F-16  and  C-130J  programs,  which  continue  to  draw  interest  from international customers for new aircraft.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers accounted for 29% of MFC's net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The PAC-3 family of missiles are the only combat proven Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide  missile  defense  capabilities.  THAAD  is  an  integrated  system  designed  to  protect  against  high  altitude  ballistic  missile threats. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from Germany and Taiwan and for Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) from Australia.\n\nIn 2021, international customers accounted for 28% of RMS' net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production,  modernization,  ship  integration,  test  and  lifetime  support  for  ships  of  international  customers  such  as  Japan,  Spain, Republic  of  Korea,  and  Australia.  We  have  ongoing  combat  systems  programs  associated  with  different  classes  of  surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile, and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Canada,  Singapore,  Australia,  Germany  and  France.  We  have  active  development, production,  and  sustainment  support  of  the  S-70  Black  Hawk\u00ae  and  MH-60  Seahawk\u00ae  helicopters  to  international  customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Greece. Additionally, in December 2021,  the  Israeli  Ministry  of  Defense  signed  a  Letter  of  Offer  and Acceptance  (LOA)  to  procure  12  CH-53K  King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation.\n\nIn  2021,  international  customers  accounted  for  8%  of  Space's  net  sales.  The  majority  of  our  Space  business  segment international  sales  in  2021  were  from  our  majority  share  of  AWE  Management  Limited  (AWE),  which  operated  the  United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent program until June 30, 2021. As previously announced, on June 30, 2021 the UK Ministry of Defence renationalized  AWE  and,  accordingly,  the  AWE  program's  ongoing  operations  are  no  longer  included  in  our  financial  results beginning as of that date.\n\n## Status of the F-35 Program\n\nThe  F-35  program  primarily  consists  of  production  contracts,  sustainment  activities,  and  new  development  efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.",

      "answer": "FedEx Express experienced a 4% revenue decline in 2024, partly due to reduced demand surcharges, which signals pressure on the segment's top line. This decline comes alongside significant business optimization costs\u2014$582 million in 2024\u2014aimed at improving long-term profitability.

The combination of declining revenue and ongoing restructuring costs raises concerns about the segment's ability to stabilize cash flows, which in turn increases FedEx's risk exposure since it stands as guarantor on these secured financing arrangements. The impairment of aircraft assets in prior years further complicates the value and utilization of the fleet backing these obligations.",

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower yields and reduced volume at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics'). FedEx Freight revenue decreased 6% in 2024 primarily due to lower shipments, weight per shipment, and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement. FedEx Ground revenue increased 2% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement and higher volume, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax , or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx  Dataworks.

This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related ex penditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the aggregate pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Mining segment had $8 million in non-accrual financing receivables with an allowance as of December 31, 2021, indicating credit risk in its financing portfolio. This contrasts with the Mining segment's overall financing activity, where the pre-TDR amortized cost was $11 million in 2021, suggesting that the segment's financing operations were relatively small compared to other regions.

      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment reported $1,006 million in GE-funded R&D for 2023, indicating significant investment in innovation and development. However, the Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for Aerospace showed a negative balance of $4,318 million as of December 31, 2022, suggesting that the segment is under financial pressure from these agreements, possibly due to deferred revenue or unrecouped costs. This contrast highlights a strategic tension between investing heavily in R&D to maintain competitive advantage and facing immediate financial obligations from long-term service contracts, which could affect profitability and cash flow in the short term.",

      "question": "How does Boeing balance the $7,875 million revenue increase in its BCA segment with the corresponding rise in research and development spending that affected operating losses, especially considering the abnormal production costs for the 787 and 777X programs?",
      "answer": "Boeing\u2019s BCA segment experienced a $7,875 million revenue increase in 2023, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries (page 26). However, this growth was partially offset by higher research and development spending, which negatively impacted the segment\u2019s operating loss (page 27). Despite the increase in R&D spending, the loss from operations at BCA decreased by $706 million year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of higher deliveries and lower abnormal production costs. Notably, abnormal production costs in 2023 totaled $1,527 million\u2014$1,014 million for the 787 program and $513 million for the 777X program\u2014down from $1,753 million in 2022 (page 32). This suggests Boeing is managing its cost structure while investing in R&D, which could support future product development and long-term competitiveness.",

      "answer": "The Pratt & Whitney segment recognizes revenue over time for long-term aerospace contracts using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs, which aligns with the $6.2 billion organic increase in Total Cost of Sales in 2024, as the segment's growth in net sales directly drove a corresponding rise in cost of sales. This cost increase is explicitly attributed to organic sales growth at Pratt & Whitney and its peers, indicating that higher production and service delivery volumes under long-term contracts\u2014recognized over time\u2014led to increased cost of sales. The alignment reflects how revenue recognition timing and cost flow are interlinked in long-duration contracts where performance and cost accumulation occur incrementally.",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of UPS's self-insurance reserves to a 5% improvement in claim severity rates, as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, align with the actual year-over-year change in self-insurance reserves reported on the balance sheet?",
      "answer": "The notes to the financial statements on page 58 indicate that a 5% improvement in claim severity rates would reduce self-insurance reserves by approximately $290 million. However, the balance sheet on page 68 shows that self-insurance reserves only decreased by $37 million from $1,085 million in 2020 to $1,048 million in 2021. This suggests that while claim severity rates improved, the actual impact on reserves was significantly less than the theoretical $290 million sensitivity, potentially indicating that the improvement in claim severity rates was less than 5%, or that other factors such as claim frequency or new claims offset part of the expected reserve reduction.",

      "answer": "The Aerospace segment faced supply chain disruptions that limited production ramp-up and increased costs, as noted in the MD&A on page 32. Despite these challenges, the company reported $16,192 million in identifiable assets for Aerospace in 2024, showing a significant increase from $15,099 million in 2023 and $12,676 million in 2022. This upward trend in identifiable assets suggests that General Dynamics continues to invest in and maintain substantial capital resources for Aerospace, potentially positioning the segment to improve capacity and efficiency over time. However, the relatively modest capital expenditures of $235 million in 2024 for Aerospace may indicate a cautious approach to reinvestment amid ongoing operational constraints.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(Dollars in millions, ex cept per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\nFor an overview of our operating segm ents, including a discussion of our m ajor products and services, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 com pared with 2023 should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statem ents included in Item  8, while a discussion of 2023 com pared with 2022 can be found in Item  7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GLOBAL EVENTS\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global econom ies and governm ent activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally , in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries im posed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus. Lastly , the im pact of the conflict in the Middle East continues to evolve. The disruptions caused by these events continue to im pact global econom ies and businesses, including ours. The prim ary im pact to our business is supply chain challenges, including availability of parts, quality escapes and inflationary pressures.\n\nIn our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges paced our ability to ram p up production at the rate we like in response to strong custom er demand for our aircraft, causing out-of-sequence m anufacturing that increased costs and decreased operational efficiency . In addition, the conflict in the Middle East im pacted the delivery schedule for our Israel-based supplier of m id-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segm ents, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges that continue to im pact our Marine System s segm ent.

      "answer": "RTX notes that Collins Aerospace was significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic due to reduced demand for commercial air travel, affecting its sales and operations. Despite this, the company also reported that Collins Aerospace was the primary contributor to an organic cost of sales decrease of $1.3 billion in 2021, driven by cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior-year unfavorable adjustments. This suggests that while the segment faced top-line pressure from external factors, internal efficiency measures helped mitigate some financial impact. The dual perspective highlights how operational improvements offset some pandemic-related challenges in terms of cost performance.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses.

However, the company retains Aerospace's share of postretirement benefit liabilities, which include a portion of principal pension and retiree health and life insurance plans, until the planned GE Vernova spin-off. This creates a tension between the forward-looking, innovation-driven narrative of GE Aerospace and the legacy cost burden of $4.2 billion in net postretirement liabilities (part of which is now transferred to GE HealthCare, but the remainder remains with GE for Aerospace and Energy). This alignment challenge highlights how legacy obligations may constrain the agility and financial flexibility of a business being positioned as a high-tech, future-focused entity.",

      "answer": "Honeywell Building Technologies achieved a Segment Profit of $1,238 million in 2021, which was partially driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, as noted in the Segment Profit analysis. This profit growth was influenced by its significant international exposure, with 66% of its products and services manufactured or performed outside the U.S., making the segment highly susceptible to currency fluctuations. The favorable foreign exchange effects likely enhanced both sales and profitability, despite rising material costs that partially offset these gains.",

      "question": "How does the $2.8 billion increase in Other Accrued Liabilities in 2023, driven by Pratt & Whitney's PW1100 GTF engine issue, reconcile with the $1.7 billion balance in that same liability account by the end of 2024, especially in light of Pratt & Whitney's customer-related credit losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Pratt & Whitney recorded a $2.9 billion pre-tax operating profit charge due to the PW1100 GTF engine powder metal issue, which resulted in a $2.8 billion increase in Other Accrued Liabilities, primarily for expected customer compensation. By the end of 2024, this liability had decreased to $1.7 billion, reflecting customer compensation paid or credited during the year. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Pratt & Whitney also recorded a customer bankruptcy-related reserve increase of $294 million ($491M - $197M) in its Allowance for Expected Credit Losses, indicating that some customers were unable to absorb the full cost of engine inspections and replacements. This suggests that while some liabilities were settled through credits or payments, new credit risks emerged, influencing both the reduction in accrued liabilities and the increase in credit loss reserves.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial to the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices.  We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Estimating  our  liability  based  on  both  the  likelihood  of  any  adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution.\n\nIn 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo. This determination was made pursuant to Pratt &amp; Whitney's safety management system.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney issued a special instruction (SI) to operators of PW1100 GTF powered A320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and  engine  removals  covering  an  initial  subset  of  operational  engines,  no  later  than  September  15,  2023.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2023,  through  its  safety management system, Pratt &amp; Whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment, which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining PW1100 fleet. This updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. G uidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (SB) and SI in November 2023, and this guidance has been reflected in airworthiness  directives  issued  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).  Consistent  with  previous  information,  the  actions  are  resulting  in  significant incremental shop visits.\n\nAs a result of this matter, Pratt &amp; Whitney expects aircraft on ground levels for the PW1100 powered A320neo fleet to remain elevated through 2026. As a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, Pratt &amp; Whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $2.9 billion, reflecting Pratt &amp; Whitney's net 51% program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt &amp; Whitney's long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business's long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.\n\nThe charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion, which principally related to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had other accrued liabilities of $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to ex pected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during 2024 was primarily due to customer compensation in the form of credits issued and cash paid to customers during the period.\n\nOther engine models within Pratt &amp; Whitney's fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical ex perience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans. We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based  on  company  data  and  appropriate  market  indicators.  They  are  evaluated  annually  at  December  31  and  when  significant  events  require  a  mid-year remeasurement.  A  change  in  any  of  these  assumptions  or  actual  experience  that  differs  from  these  assumptions  are  subject  to  recognition  in  pension  and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAssumptions  used  in  the  accounting  for  these  employee  benefit  plans  require  judgement.  Major  assumptions  include  the  discount  rate  and  EROA.  Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows.",

      "answer": "FedEx's transportation segments experienced yield declines due to lower fuel surcharges in 2024 (page 28), which directly impacted the Corporate, Other, and Eliminations segment's revenue (page 55). Despite these yield pressures, FedEx allocated $331 million of the DRIVE transformation costs to this same segment in 2024 (page 113). This indicates management's strategic prioritization of long-term network optimization over short-term yield stabilization, even as fuel cost reductions negatively affected revenue streams across all transportation units.

      "answer": "The Raytheon Merger caused RMD's long-term contracts, which are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method, to be reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date. This reset significantly reduced favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the short term, including a $40 million favorable change in EAC adjustments in 2021. This accounting impact highlights the sensitivity of RMD's revenue recognition to contract type and timing, which is why the company finds it meaningful to disaggregate its revenue by contract type. This disaggregation provides stakeholders with a clearer view of how different types of contracts influence the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of RMD's revenue and cash flows, especially in light of the volatility introduced by EAC adjustments post-merger.",

This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon Merger, see 'Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.'\n\nIn our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customers incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers, which are treated as a reduction in sales.\n\nIn our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace OEM products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs as the  related  performance  obligations  are  satisfied.  In  instances  where  intellectual  property  does  not  transfer  to  the  customer,  we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $1,974 million and $1,981 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are classified in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other operating activities,  net  in  our  Consolidated  Statement  of  Cash  Flows.  We  regularly  assess  capitalized  contract  fulfillment  costs  for impairment and recognized $111 million of impairment for contract fulfillment costs in 2020. Costs to obtain contracts are not material.\n\nIn view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these  collaboration  arrangements  are  recorded  consistent  with  our  revenue  recognition  policies  in  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Amounts attributable  to  our  collaborators  for  their  share  of  sales  are  recorded  as  cost  of  sales  in  our  Consolidated Financial  Statements  based  upon  the  terms  and  nature  of  the  arrangement.  Costs  associated  with  engine  programs  under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from  collaborators  of  their  share  of  program  costs  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  the  related  expense  item  at  that  time.  As  of December 31, 2021, the collaborators' interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from 13% to 49%, inclusive of a portion of Pratt &amp; Whitney's interests held by other participants. Pratt &amp; Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a 25% share in an individual",

We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers' ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers' decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers' liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\n\n## Failure to maintain our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\n\nEach of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies.  These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, profitability, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting.  There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.  There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\n\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium-term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature. Cat Financial also could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial's business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:\n\n- Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could increase Cat Financial's write-offs and provision for credit losses.\n- The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management's judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.\n- Cat Financial's ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n- As  Cat  Financial's  borrowing  agreements  are  primarily  with  financial  institutions,  their  ability  to  perform  in  accordance  with  any  of  our  underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Power segment shows a shift in credit risk patterns between 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the segment had $5 million in 91+ days past due receivables, indicating significant delinquency issues. By 2023, this shifted to $8 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance, suggesting either a worsening of credit quality where delinquencies have transitioned into formal non-accrual status, or a change in how Caterpillar is categorizing and managing credit risk in this segment. This transition without an allowance indicates potentially higher risk exposure compared to previous years.",

According to the MD&A section, this was due to global supply chain challenges that constrained profitability even as sales grew.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M's MD&amp;A is presented in eight sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Results of Operations\n- Performance by Business Segment\n- Performance by Geographic Area\n- Critical Accounting Estimates\n- New Accounting Pronouncements\n- Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Financial Instruments\n\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled 'Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results' in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\n\nAdditional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2020 and 2019 can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' sections in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, 3M made the following changes. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n\n- Change in accounting principle for net periodic pension and postretirement plan cost. See detailed discussion in Note 1.\n- Change in measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19.\n- Change in alignment of certain products within 3M's Consumer business segment-creating the Consumer Health and Safety Division. See additional information in Note 19.\n\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts) that is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months posttransaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\n## Consideration of COVID-19:\n\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A 'Risk Factors' in this document. Given the diversity of 3M's businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 have increased the demand for 3M products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers.\n\nOverall, 3M experienced broad-based organic growth across business segments and all geographies in 2021 despite global supply challenges. 3M's total sales increased 9.9% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2020. Organic sales increased 8.8% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, COVID-related respirator sales negatively impacted year-on-year organic sales growth by approximately 0.2% as they grew at a slower rate than the rest of the Company. Given the diversity of 3M's businesses, the impact of COVID-19 varied across the Company. In 2020, 3M experienced strong sales in personal safety, as well as in other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration while businesses aligned to general industrial applications with strength in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes. At the same time, weakness in several end markets, while improving, contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3M's businesses such as oral care, automotive and aerospace, advanced materials, commercial solutions, stationery and office,",

      "answer": "Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine production challenges, including the powder metal issue in the PW1100G-JM engine that powers the A320neo family, led to increased engine removals, inspections, and associated costs. This had a measurable impact on the commercial aerospace segment\u2019s consolidated net sales. In 2022, Pratt & Whitney reported $13,666 million in commercial aerospace sales, but this dropped to $11,133 million in 2023\u2014a decline of $2,533 million. This significant year-over-year decrease contrasts with the overall growth in RTX\u2019s consolidated net sales (from $67,074 million to $68,920 million), indicating that the GTF engine issues disproportionately affected Pratt & Whitney\u2019s performance relative to other segments. The production delays and increased costs tied to the GTF family likely constrained sales growth and contributed to the segment\u2019s underperformance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

      "answer": "The high level of intersegment sales attributed to the Rotary and Mission Systems segment ($1,895 million in 2021) indicates that it plays a central role in supplying other business segments within Lockheed Martin. This aligns with the company's decision to exclude intersegment sales from segment performance evaluation, as these transactions are internal and do not reflect the external revenue-generating performance of individual segments.

We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:\n\n- Aeronautics - Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.\n- Missiles  and  Fire  Control -  Provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.\n- Rotary and Mission Systems -  Designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface  ships,  sea  and  land-based  missile  defense  systems,  radar  systems,  sea  and  air-based  mission  and  combat  systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions.\n- Space -  Engaged  in  the  research  and  development,  design,  engineering  and  production  of  satellites,  space  transportation systems,  and  strategic,  advanced  strike,  and  defensive  systems.  Space  provides  network-enabled  situational  awareness  and integrates  complex  space  and  ground  global  systems  to  help  our  customers  gather,  analyze  and  securely  distribute  critical intelligence  data.  Space  is  also  responsible  for  various  classified  systems  and  services  in  support  of  vital  national  security systems. Operating profit for our Space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our 50% ownership interest in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Our investment in ULA totaled $585 million and $691 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Selected Financial Data by Business Segment\n\nNet  sales  of  our  business  segments  in  the  following  tables  exclude  intersegment  sales  as  these  activities  are  eliminated  in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment.",

      "question": "Given the 31% year-over-year growth in Oil and Gas sales within the Energy & Transportation segment, how does Caterpillar's capital expenditure allocation to Energy & Transportation in 2023 reflect its strategic emphasis on sustaining growth in this high-performing application area?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's Oil and Gas sales grew by 31% in 2023, contributing significantly to the overall 18% sales increase in the Energy & Transportation segment. This growth was driven by higher demand for turbines, reciprocating engines, and related services. Despite this strong performance, the company allocated $944 million in capital expenditures to the Energy & Transportation segment in 2023, which represents a 25% increase from $756 million in 2022. This capital allocation aligns with Caterpillar's strategic focus on sustaining growth in high-performing areas like Oil and Gas, as increased investment likely supports expanded production capacity, service infrastructure, and technology development tailored to this application. The capital expenditure pattern suggests Caterpillar is reinforcing its position in the Oil and Gas market to capitalize on current demand trends.",

      "answer": "The Net UTB is explicitly included as a component of Accrued Income Taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, indicating that changes in Net UTB directly affect the Accrued Income Taxes line item. In 2023, the $218 million decrease in Accrued Income Taxes, as disclosed in the operating cash flows, reflects net changes in tax liabilities, which could include adjustments to Net UTB. The Net UTB itself, which could impact the effective tax rate by $884 million if recognized, is influenced by factors such as interest, penalties, and deductible taxes. Therefore, the cash flow impact of the $218 million decrease in Accrued Income Taxes may partially stem from changes in Net UTB, which is a component of that balance and subject to ongoing tax position adjustments.",

      "question": "Given Lockheed Martin's increased risk of reduced operating profit from fixed-price contracts, how does the Aeronautics segment's $2,825 million operating profit in 2023 reflect the company's exposure to cost overruns and reach-forward losses, especially considering the segment's significant net sales of $27,474 million?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics segment reported $27,474 million in net sales and $2,825 million in operating profit in 2023, indicating it is a major revenue and profit contributor. However, the company's risk factors highlight that fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of their contracts, expose them to cost overruns and reach-forward losses. These risks can directly reduce operating profit, as seen in the discussion around the potential for reduced margins or losses on fixed-price development and production contracts. The segment's profitability must be viewed in light of these inherent risks, suggesting that despite strong reported profits, the segment remains vulnerable to downward adjustments if cost estimates prove inaccurate or performance issues arise.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Domestic Package segment experienced double-digit revenue per piece growth in 2021, driven by base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix, and fuel and demand-related surcharges. This aligns with UPS's broader strategic focus on growing revenue per piece, as noted in the financial analysis section, where the company reported that overall revenue per piece increases were driven by base rate increases averaging 4.9% in December 2020, execution of revenue quality initiatives, and fuel surcharges. Amazon, representing 11.7% of consolidated revenue, was a significant contributor to this segment, suggesting that even large customers were subject to these pricing strategies, reinforcing the effectiveness of UPS's approach to revenue optimization.",

We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "The Missiles and Fire Control segment experienced a significant drop in operating profit from $1,541 million in 2023 to $413 million in 2024, indicating a sharp decline in segment performance. Meanwhile, the company treats state income taxes ($121 million in 2024) as allowable costs in government contracts, meaning these taxes are included in cost of sales rather than being treated as an expense that directly reduces operating profit. This accounting treatment may soften the negative impact of state taxes on operating profit, but it does not explain the steep drop in the Missiles and Fire Control segment\u2019s profitability. The decline likely reflects underlying operational or contractual challenges specific to the segment.",

However, the broader financial support agreement on page 41 reveals that Caterpillar guarantees certain subsidiary borrowings and has a support agreement requiring it to maintain ownership of Cat Financial and potentially provide financial support if Cat Financial fails to meet certain financial ratios.

      "answer": "Resource Industries reported a profit of $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, despite facing a depreciation and amortization expense of $403 million for the full year. This indicates that the segment was able to generate strong operational returns even while managing substantial capital expenditures. On a consolidated basis, Caterpillar reported a profit of $6,489 million for 2021, meaning Resource Industries alone contributed nearly 5% directly to the company\u2019s total profitability. This highlights the segment\u2019s efficiency in utilizing its asset base to generate earnings, suggesting effective asset management and operational leverage within a capital-intensive industry.",

The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume,  driven  by higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  aftermarket  parts,  and  favorable  price  realization.  End-user  demand  was  higher  in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "The Transportation and Electronics segment reported a total sales change of 10.6% in 2021, which was primarily driven by organic sales growth of 9.0% and a 1.6% contribution from translation (MMM page_26). This aligns with the segment's actual net sales growth of 10.6% from $8,833 million in 2020 to $9,769 million in 2021 (MMM page_25). The consistency between the total sales change metric and the reported net sales growth indicates that the segment's performance was largely organic, with modest support from currency translation, suggesting strong underlying demand in its core markets.",

      "question": "How does the geographic exposure of Performance Materials and Technologies, with 57% of sales coming from non-U.S. manufactured products and services, relate to the 14.5% increase in Segment Profit for that division in 2021, especially considering the role of foreign currency translation in driving profitability improvements?",
      "answer": "Performance Materials and Technologies had 57% of its sales derived from non-U.S. manufactured products and services, indicating significant international exposure (page 10). In 2021, the segment reported a Segment Profit of $2,120 million, up from $1,851 million in 2020, representing a 14.5% increase (page 115). According to the management discussion (page 27), Segment Profit growth was driven in part by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, which aligns with the high proportion of non-U.S. sales in this segment. This suggests that the international footprint of Performance Materials and Technologies not only exposed the segment to foreign exchange benefits but also amplified its profitability during a period of currency strength in key markets.",

      "question": "Given the decline in Operating Profit for Supply Chain Solutions in 2023, how do the acquisitions disclosed in the Supply Chain Solutions segment align with UPS's strategy to offset profitability pressures from this segment?",
      "answer": "UPS reported a significant decline in Operating Profit for the Supply Chain Solutions segment, from $1,771 million in 2022 to $834 million in 2023. Despite this drop, UPS pursued strategic acquisitions in 2023, including Happy Returns and MNX Global Logistics, both integrated into Supply Chain Solutions. These acquisitions, costing approximately $1.3 billion net of cash acquired, suggest a strategic pivot to enhance capabilities and potentially drive future profitability within the segment. This indicates that UPS is investing to counterbalance current profitability pressures through expanded service offerings and market reach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(page_26) \u2192 Operating Profit: Operating profit for Supply Chain Solutions dropped significantly from $1,771 million in 2022 to $834 million in 2023 due to volume and market rate declines in Forwarding.",
        "Hop 2: Operating Profit \u2192 Supply Chain Solutions: The segment\u2019s operating profit is directly disclosed in the financial tables and is a key component of the overall operating profit decline.",
        "Hop 3: Supply Chain Solutions \u2190 UPS(page_100): UPS acquired Happy Returns and MNX Global Logistics in 2023, investing $1.3 billion net of cash acquired, signaling strategic intent to strengthen the segment despite current profitability challenges."

      "answer": "3M allocates the service cost component of defined benefit pension costs to various expense categories including research, development, and related expenses, which are explicitly reported across business segments such as Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. In 2024, these segments reported research, development, and related expenses of $485 million, $460 million, and $132 million respectively. This allocation indicates that employee benefit costs are embedded within operational line items rather than being treated as standalone corporate liabilities. By integrating service cost components into segment-level expenses, 3M aligns benefit costs with the business units that generate the associated liabilities, influencing segment-level profitability and performance transparency.",

      "answer": "Resource Industries reported a profit margin of 11.0% in Q4 2021, down from 12.5% in Q4 2020, with the decline attributed to 'unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.' This aligns with Caterpillar's consolidated operating profit discussion, which identified 'unfavorable manufacturing costs' driven by 'increased freight and higher material costs' as a key drag on profitability in 2021. The connection is further reinforced by the fact that Resource Industries, as a major segment with $403 million in depreciation and amortization in 2021, contributed significantly to the broader cost pressures affecting the company's overall performance.",

The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

      "answer": "GE's Power segment invested $319 million in R&D in 2023, suggesting ongoing efforts to develop new offerings or enhance existing technologies. As of December 31, 2022, the segment reported $3,640 million in long-term service agreements and $1,763 million in billings in excess of revenues, indicating a substantial base of contracted future revenue. These figures imply that prior R&D investments may have contributed to securing long-term service contracts, which now serve as a source of deferred revenue and potential future cash flows. The current billings position suggests that the segment is in a phase where it is collecting cash in advance of revenue recognition, which could support continued R&D investment in 2023 and beyond.",

      "question": "Given the risks outlined in LMT's 10-K regarding cost overruns on fixed-price contracts and their potential to reduce operating profit, how does the decline in operating profit for the Rotary and Mission Systems segment from $1,906 million in 2022 to $1,865 million in 2023 reconcile with the increase in segment assets from $17,988 million to $17,521 million over the same period?",
      "answer": "The decline in operating profit for the Rotary and Mission Systems segment from $1,906 million in 2022 to $1,865 million in 2023 suggests potential cost overruns or performance challenges, which aligns with the risks described in the 10-K related to fixed-price contracts. Despite this decline in profitability, segment assets increased from $17,988 million to $17,521 million, indicating continued investment or capital intensity in the segment. This juxtaposition implies that while LMT is investing more capital in Rotary and Mission Systems, the expected returns have slightly decreased, potentially due to the risks outlined in the contract performance section. This dynamic highlights a tension between capital deployment and profitability in a high-risk contract environment.",

For the Safety and Industrial segment specifically, Translation added 2.0% to its 9.8% total sales growth. Despite this positive impact on growth, the Safety and Industrial segment's operating income declined by 3.3% year-over-year, suggesting that the segment may have faced cost pressures or margin challenges, possibly linked to currency fluctuations. This implies that while the segment benefited from favorable exchange rates boosting reported sales, the underlying profitability was negatively impacted, highlighting the dual-edged nature of currency exposure in MMM's international operations.",

This sensitivity analysis indicates a material financial exposure to fluctuations in claim frequency assumptions. However, the actual self-insurance reserves reported on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, were $1,048 million, suggesting that the company's reserve levels are significantly influenced by these actuarial assumptions.

These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increases, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates, regulatory requirements and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.\n\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are:\n\n- Changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date;\n- Differences between expected and the actual return on plan assets;\n- Changes in demographic assumptions including mortality;\n- Differences in participant experience from demographic assumptions; and\n- Changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense upon remeasurement of a plan. The remaining components of pension expense (referred to as \"ongoing net periodic benefit cost\"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are reported on a quarterly basis.",

(1)\n\nA five percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity and claim frequency rates used to estimate our selfinsurance reserves would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $290 million, respectively, in our reserves and expenses as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2021.\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nOur pension and other postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increases, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates, regulatory requirements and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.\n\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are:\n\n- Changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date;\n- Differences between expected and the actual return on plan assets;\n- Changes in demographic assumptions including mortality;\n- Differences in participant experience from demographic assumptions; and\n- Changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense upon remeasurement of a plan. The remaining components of pension expense (referred to as \"ongoing net periodic benefit cost\"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are reported on a quarterly basis.",

      "answer": "GE has retained the postretirement benefit plans for GE Energy (which includes Power and Renewable Energy) until the planned spin-off of GE Vernova, as stated in the post-split benefit plan disclosures. This decision is tied to the broader strategic plan to spin off GE Vernova, which is highlighted in the forward-looking statements as subject to execution risks, regulatory conditions, and timing uncertainties. The funding and liability implications of retaining these plans until the spin-off introduce operational and financial execution risks, especially given the potential delays or complications in satisfying pre-conditions for the transaction. This alignment shows that GE's current benefit plan structure is contingent on the successful and timely execution of the GE Vernova spin-off, which itself is flagged as uncertain in the forward-looking context.",

      "answer": "The Transportation and Electronics segment reported a negative organic sales growth of (3.5)% in 2023, which was further reduced by (1.0)% due to foreign exchange translation, resulting in a total sales decline of (4.5)%.

          "chunk_text": "\nGeneral Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP): As of December 31, 2024, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Company's GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "The Space segment's intersegment sales declined from $381M in 2022 to $358M in 2023, reflecting a reduction in internal transactions. These intersegment sales are fully eliminated in consolidation, as Lockheed Martin excludes intercompany balances and transactions in its consolidated financial statements. This decrease could signal a shift in internal collaboration or delivery timing within the company\u2019s broader segment operations, which are evaluated based on metrics like operating profit that exclude intersegment activity. This aligns with the company\u2019s approach of focusing segment performance on external sales and CAS pension-adjusted profitability.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Pratt & Whitney's operating profit in 2023 relate to the increased credit loss reserves recorded at the segment in late 2024, and what does this imply about RTX's financial exposure to customer credit risk?",
      "answer": "Pratt & Whitney's operating profit declined to -$1,455 million in 2023, indicating a significant financial strain on the segment. This was followed in late 2024 by a substantial increase in credit loss reserves\u2014driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney\u2014that contributed to RTX's overall allowance for expected credit losses rising to $491 million as of December 31, 2024. The connection between the segment's deteriorating profitability and the rise in credit risk exposure suggests that RTX's financial health is increasingly vulnerable to customer defaults, particularly within the Pratt & Whitney division.",

      "answer": "The fair value hedge adjustment of $5 million associated with UPS's long-term debt and finance leases as of December 31, 2023, increases the carrying amount of the hedged liabilities from $280 million to $285 million. However, on the balance sheet, the total long-term debt and finance leases are reported at $18,916 million, which includes unhedged portions and other adjustments not captured in the fair value hedge disclosures. This indicates that the hedging adjustments have a relatively minor impact on the overall liability position.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(page_131) \u2192 Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities: Discloses $280 million as the carrying amount of hedged liabilities related to long-term debt and finance leases, with a cumulative fair value hedge adjustment of $5 million.",
        "Hop 2: Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities \u2192 Long-Term Debt and Finance Leases: The hedged liabilities are a subset of the total long-term debt and finance leases, indicating that only a portion of these liabilities are subject to fair value hedge accounting.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's exposure to delinquencies in its Mining segment receivables compare to its overall provisioning for non-accrual finance receivables with an allowance, and what does this suggest about the credit risk management in this specific segment?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's Mining segment reported $863 million in current finance receivables as of December 31, 2022, with no amounts 31-90 days past due and only $1 million in the 91+ days past due category. However, the company's overall non-accrual finance receivables with an allowance totaled $152 million as of December 31, 2023, of which only $2 million was attributed to the Mining segment. This suggests that while the Mining segment has a relatively large base of current receivables, it carries a minimal portion of the total credit risk provisioning, indicating either strong credit quality in this segment or conservative provisioning across the broader portfolio.",

      "question": "How does the impact of fluctuating fuel surcharges on FedEx's 2024 revenue relate to the asset impairment charges at FedEx Express, and how might this affect FedEx's secured debt obligations tied to aircraft assets?",
      "answer": "FedEx's 2024 revenue was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges across all transportation segments, contributing to a 3% overall revenue decline. At FedEx Express, this decline was compounded by volume reductions and lower demand surcharges. These financial pressures align with the $157 million in asset impairment charges recorded in 2024 at FedEx Express due to the retirement of 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and related engines. The impairment reflects a strategic move to modernize the fleet and align capacity with current shipment volumes. FedEx Express has $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates secured by 19 Boeing aircraft with a net book value of $1.7 billion as of May 31, 2024. The impairment and fleet restructuring could affect the valuation or utilization of these secured assets, potentially influencing FedEx\u2019s long-term debt obligations and financial flexibility.",

Includes a $35 million charge in 2023 related to a separate FedEx Ground legal matter.\n\nOperating income increased in 2024 primarily due to our DRIVE program initiatives and base yield improvements at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, which more than offset volume declines at FedEx Freight and FedEx Express. Our DRIVE initiatives included continued benefits from network rationalization at FedEx Express, including structural flight takedowns and route optimization, and improvements in hub sort efficiency, as well as increasing linehaul efficiencies and improving dock productivity at FedEx Ground. Lower volumes contributed to reductions in salaries and employee benefits, fuel expense, purchased transportation, and rentals and landing fees. The effect of volume declines on salaries and employee benefits was offset by higher wages and variable incentive compensation. Other operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower bad debt accruals, professional fees, and self-insurance accruals.\n\nWe recognized $157 million and $70 million of asset impairment charges in 2024 and 2023, respectively, associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at FedEx Express. Our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx Dataworks. See the 'Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges' section of this MD&amp;A for more information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. We routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments.\n\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.",

Revenue at Corporate, other, and eliminations decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower yields and reduced volume at FedEx Logistics, Inc. ('FedEx Logistics'). FedEx Freight revenue decreased 6% in 2024 primarily due to lower shipments, weight per shipment, and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement. FedEx Ground revenue increased 2% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement and higher volume, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges\n\nIn 2024, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 22 Boeing 757-200 aircraft and seven related engines to align with the plans of FedEx Express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $157 million ($120 million, net of tax , or $0.48 per diluted share) was recorded in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 Boeing MD-11F aircraft and 25 related engines, four Boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft and eight related engines for the same reasons stated above. As a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax , or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to FedEx Dataworks. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. We also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax , or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the ShopRunner acquisition at FedEx  Dataworks. For additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section of this MD&amp;A and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business Optimization and Realignment Costs\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. These costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. The identification of these costs as business optimization-related ex penditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. We expect the aggregate pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. The timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.",

      "answer": "MMM reported that Safety and Industrial segment operating income margins increased year-on-year, driven by growth, productivity, and spending discipline, despite a decline in Industrial Specialties Sales from $1,180 million in 2023 to $1,137 million in 2024. This suggests that the segment was able to offset lower sales in this category through cost management and operational efficiencies. However, the decline in Industrial Specialties Sales, which was noted in the segment's organic sales performance as a result of reduced consumer discretionary spending and lower e-commerce shipments, indicates ongoing market challenges. The strategic focus on margin expansion appears to be compensating for these top-line pressures, though continued investment in growth initiatives and dis-synergies from the Solventum spin-off are acting as partial offsets.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "The $519 million increase in progress collections from long-term service agreements (LTSA) in the Commercial Engines & Services (CES) segment (from page 54) reflects stronger cash flow generation tied to service contracts, which directly supports the segment's operational performance. As described in the segment overview, CES offers services under long-term service agreements and generates 74% of its revenue from services, including LTSAs. This revenue stream contributes to the financial performance of the CES segment, which in turn influences its equity method investments. On page 76, CES reports an equity method investment balance of $1,610 million and equity method income of $301 million for 2024, showing that the segment's improved collections and service-driven revenue are translating into positive returns from its investments. This indicates that the growth in LTSA-related collections is a contributing factor to the segment\u2019s ability to generate investment income.",

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company's installed base of approximately 45,000 commercial and 25,000 military engines drives our aftermarket services business, which represents approximately 70% of revenue, reflecting the strength of customer demand across our business. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities for today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the production and services ramp for new engines) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology for our commercial and defense customers). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company completed the separation of its healthcare business into an independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare), and on April 2, 2024, the Company completed the separation of its GE V ernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with these separations, the historical results of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova, and certain assets and liabilities included in the separations, are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nWe serve customers in approximately 120 countries. M anufacturing and service operations are carried out at 67 facilities located in 22 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, of which 24 are owned, and at 67 facilities located in 24 other countries, of which 34 are owned.\n\nSEGMENTS. GE Aerospace operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENGINES &amp; SERVICES. Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines for commercial airframes, as well as business aviation and aeroderivative applications. Services include maintenance, repair and overhaul (M RO) of engines and the sale of spare parts, and we offer services under a variety of arrangements such as long-term service agreements or time and material contracts. CES was approximately 70% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 74% of total CES revenue.\n\nOur CES customers for equipment and services consist primarily of airframers and airlines, including both Boeing and A irbus, and third-party M RO shops, to whom we sell equipment and license M RO technology. CES engines power aircraft in all commercial categories-narrowbody, widebody and regional-and this includes engines sold by joint venture partners, the most significant of which is CFM  International, a 50-50 non-consolidated joint venture with Safran A ircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. Depending on the aircraft model, airline customers may have a choice between our engines and those of other manufacturers or, as in the case of some Boeing models, our engines may be the sole source engine for a particular aircraft.\n\nCommercial and financial dynamics for major engine platforms often play out over the course of many years, as new product development cycles are long and, after initial sale, commercial engines can operate for decades with services in the aftermarket. In the narrowbody aircraft segment, we are in the midst of a significant ramp in production of the LEA P engine, which entered into service in 2016 and is expected in the coming years to overtake the mature CFM 56 as the industry's most utilized narrowbody engine. This is expected to also drive a significant increase in shop visits and need for M RO capacity as LEA P engines come due for services. In the widebody aircraft segment, we have a range of engine platforms that are in different stages of their lifecycles. These include the more mature CF6 and GE90 engines, as well as the GEnx engine that entered into service in 2011 and the GE9X engine that will power the Boeing 777X  when that aircraft enters into serv ice. We also have engines that power regional and business aircraft.\n\nWe have been and remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently completed more than 250 tests on developing a full-scale Open Fan engine. This is one of several initiativ es underway to help invent the future of flight.\n\nDEFENSE &amp; PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) is a leading provider of defense engines and critical aircraft systems, and it consists of our Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies businesses. DPT was approximately 25% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 56% of total DPT revenue.\n\nDefense &amp; Systems - Defense &amp; Systems designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines and avionics and power systems for governments, militaries and commercial airframers. Services include M RO of engines and the sale of spare parts.\n\nOur product performance and dedication to innovation have earned long-standing relationships with airframers, shipyards, government agencies and other customers globally. We also regularly work with government customers on the development of classified and unclassified advanced products, including combat engines, hypersonics and unmanned applications. Recently, our team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at one megawatt with the U.S. A rmy.\n\nOur defense engines power a wide variety of fighters, bombers, tankers, transport, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as aeroderivative engines for marine applications. Significant product platforms include the F110, F404 and F414 for combat engines, the T408, T700 and T901 for rotorcraft engines and the LM2500 for mobility and marine engines.",

      "answer": "GD's Technologies segment maintains a capital-light footprint, owning only 2.2 million square feet of facilities in 2024, while holding $19,286 million in identifiable assets. This contrasts with segments like Aerospace and Marine Systems, which own 5.5 million and 9 million square feet respectively, relative to their identifiable asset bases of $16,192 million and $7,019 million. This suggests that the Technologies segment is managed with a lighter physical infrastructure footprint compared to its asset size, potentially reflecting a strategic focus on flexibility and reduced capital intensity. The filing does not explicitly state this as a strategic choice, but the data supports such an interpretation when viewed across both sections.",

However, the funded status of these obligations at the end of 2023 was only $980 million in plan assets, resulting in a funded status deficit of $917 million. This implies that MMM's projected future benefit payments are rising, while the assets set aside to cover these liabilities remain significantly below the total obligation, raising concerns about the company's ability to meet its long-term postretirement liabilities without additional contributions or improved asset returns.",

      "answer": "The Consumer segment contributed 10.3% to MMM's total sales change in 2021, which is a significant growth rate compared to other segments. However, the segment's asset base of $253 million as of December 31, 2021, was vastly smaller than the $4,622 million in Safety and Industrial or the $6,786 million in Health Care. This indicates that the Consumer segment generated outsized growth relative to its size, suggesting high asset efficiency or a high-growth potential business despite its smaller footprint. The segment's growth was driven by 9.3% organic sales growth and 1.0% from translation effects, contributing to MMM's overall 9.9% total sales change.",

      "answer": "The Financial Products segment contributed $909 million in profit in 2023, a $45 million increase from $864 million in 2022, driven by a higher net yield on earning assets and lower credit loss provisions. Simultaneously, the segment\u2019s finance receivables grew from $13,965 million to $15,386 million, indicating expanded financing activities. This profit growth from Financial Products, combined with strong performance across other segments like Energy & Transportation (which saw a 49% profit increase), contributed to Caterpillar\u2019s overall operating profit margin expansion from 13.9% to 17.6%. The Financial Products segment\u2019s stable and growing profitability played a key role in supporting Caterpillar\u2019s consolidated operating profit of $12,966 million in 2023, up from $7,904 million in 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GE HealthCare contributed $1,656 million in pre-tax earnings from discontinued operations, which was offset by a $1,706 million tax benefit related to this segment. This aligns with the broader income tax disclosure that highlights $0.6 billion in deferred tax assets associated with losses from discontinued operations, including GE HealthCare. The tax benefit recorded in 2023 suggests active utilization or reassessment of these deferred tax assets, indicating strategic tax planning around the profitability of GE HealthCare prior to its separation.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "The $176 million 'Other Corporate Expense-Net' loss in 2021 includes corporate philanthropic activity, which is one of the unallocated costs that MMM chooses not to directly assign to its business segments. This aligns with MMM's broader unallocated expense management strategy, where certain legacy-related expenses, centrally managed operational costs, and strategic initiatives like philanthropy are consolidated under 'Corporate and Unallocated' to provide clearer segment-level performance visibility. The inclusion of philanthropy within this category suggests a deliberate approach to managing strategic expenditures outside of direct business segment accountability, while maintaining flexibility in how these funds are applied year-to-year.",

The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M's effective ownership is 75 percent.\n\n## PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\nItem 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M's business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M's business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated:\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to 'Corporate and Unallocated,' which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products/businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments.

Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n## Elimination of Dual Credit\n\n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional ('dual') credit to another business segment when the customer account activity ('sales district') with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled 'Elimination of Dual Credit,' such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\n\n",

      "answer": "RTX reported a $0.3 billion increase in intersegment eliminations in 2024, primarily driven by Collins, indicating significant internal transactions involving this segment. Separately, the company noted increased program expenses at Collins, which were partially responsible for a $0.3 billion rise in customer-funded R&D in 2024, specifically citing higher expenses on military programs such as those involving Pratt & Whitney's F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU), which powers the F-35 Program. This suggests that Collins plays a key role in supporting major defense programs like the F-35, and its financial activity is deeply integrated with other segments. The interplay between intersegment eliminations and program-specific spending highlights how RTX allocates costs and manages internal collaboration on large-scale, multi-segment defense initiatives.",

Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax  related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\n\n## FAS/CAS operating adjustment\n\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension ex pense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

BGS  earnings  from operations  increased  by  $289  million  in  2024  compared  with  2023  primarily  due  to  higher  commercial  serv ices  rev enue.  Loss  from  operations  on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $288 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in eliminations and other unallocated items expense, partially offset by an increase in share-based plans income.\n\nLoss from operations decreased by $2,746 million in 2023 compared with 2022. BDS loss from operations decreased by $1,780 million compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a reduction in net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments, which were $2,328 million better than the net unfav orable impact in the prior year.  BCA loss from operations decreased by $706 million reflecting higher deliv eries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and dev elopment. BGS earnings from operations increased by $602 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial serv ices rev enue. Loss from operations on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $255 million in 2023 primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense.\n\nCore operating loss increased by $9,982 million in 2024 compared with 2023 and decreased by $2,833 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to changes in Segment operating loss as described abov e.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "question": "How does RTX's inter-segment sales contribution to Raytheon in 2024 compare to the trend in company-funded R&D spending at Raytheon, and what might this imply about the segment's strategic development focus?",
      "answer": "In 2024, RTX reported inter-segment sales contributing $143 million to Raytheon\u2019s segment sales, a slight increase from $130 million in 2023. However, despite this growth in internal sales, the company-funded R&D spending at Raytheon decreased compared to other segments, with the 2024 increase in overall R&D spending being primarily driven by Collins and Pratt & Whitney, while Raytheon experienced lower development program expenses. This suggests a potential strategic shift where Raytheon is receiving fewer internal R&D investments despite growing inter-segment revenue, possibly signaling a reduced emphasis on internally funded innovation within that segment.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar reports leased equipment to others at $5,733 million as of December 31, 2021, under Property, Plant, and Equipment - net. This leased equipment is primarily managed through Cat Financial, which owns and administers the leasing arrangements. Cat Financial actively monitors and adjusts residual values during lease terms\u2014recording depreciation adjustments for operating leases on a straight-line basis and recognizing residual value changes through reduced finance revenue for finance leases. Since Caterpillar has a stake in Cat Financial and consolidates its leasing operations, changes in residual value estimates directly impact Caterpillar's financial exposure and reported depreciation expenses.

The core operating loss also rose sharply by $10,760 million in 2020 compared to 2019, largely due to higher losses at BCA.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

      "answer": "GD's consolidated revenue increased in 2023, with growth attributed to submarine construction and engineering in the Marine Systems segment. This segment contributed 29% of consolidated revenue in 2023, up from 28% in 2022 and 27% in 2021, reflecting its growing importance. The Marine Systems segment not only builds submarines but also provides extensive post-delivery services, including submarine maintenance and modernization, through Electric Boat in various U.S. locations. Additionally, the segment maintains a significant backlog of major ship construction programs, with scheduled final delivery dates extending into the future. This combination of increasing revenue contribution and long-term service commitments suggests that Marine Systems is both a current growth driver and a source of sustained future revenue for GD.",

This suggests that the segment achieved operating leverage, where the cost structure improved relative to sales growth, enabling operating income to grow faster than sales.

Page 160 further confirms this pattern by showing that 'Total other expenses' increased to $174 million in 2021 from $137 million in 2020, aligning with the rise in Transformation Costs. This indicates that while labor-related costs declined slightly, the growth in transformation spending was concentrated in non-compensation areas such as technology, process optimization, or restructuring activities.",

      "answer": "Boeing's $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021 was a significant contributor to BCA's continued operational losses, which totaled $6,475 million for the year. This loss reflects ongoing production issues, inspections, and rework on the 787 program, which compounded the financial strain from prior years, including the $6,493 million reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020. Meanwhile, Boeing also disclosed substantial legal and regulatory liabilities tied to the 737 MAX accidents, including a $2,510 million Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DOJ and ongoing shareholder and regulatory litigation. These legal and production-related financial burdens together highlight a dual challenge for BCA: managing legacy program losses while navigating the reputational and financial fallout from the 737 MAX grounding, both of which significantly impacted its profitability and operational recovery trajectory.",

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual  remedies,  including  rights  to  reject  individual  airplane  deliveries  if  the  actual  delivery  date  is significantly later than the contractual delivery date.

See pages 49 - 51.\n\nLoss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS. BCA loss from operations decreased by $7,372 million primarily due to the absence of a $6,493  million  reach-forward  loss  on  the  777X  program  recorded  in  2020,  lower  period  expenses,  lower  737  MAX customer considerations and higher 737 MAX deliveries, partially offset by a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021. BGS earnings from operations increased by $1,567 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume.\n\nLoss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at BGS and BDS.

BCA's loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the year, lower widebody  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues, abnormal  production  costs,  737NG  frame  fitting  component  repair  costs,  severance  costs  and  737  MAX  customer considerations.\n\nThe loss in 2019 primarily reflects  the  absence  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  the  second,  third  and  fourth  quarters  and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's 2023 financial disclosures show that the Mining segment had only $2 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance, indicating strong credit quality or conservative credit policies. This aligns with the historical delinquency data from the same year, which shows zero dollars in 91+ days past due for the Mining segment, further supporting effective credit risk management. This consistency across both metrics suggests Caterpillar maintains tight control over receivables in the Mining segment, minimizing credit losses and ensuring stable cash flows from this business line.",

      "question": "What is the relationship between Boeing's $391 million equity investment in BCA and BCA's $6.3 billion increase in operating losses from 2023 to 2024, and what does this suggest about Boeing's exposure to its equity method investments?",
      "answer": "Boeing's $391 million equity investment in BCA, as disclosed in the equity method investment table, represents its stake in the BCA segment. BCA reported a $6.3 billion increase in operating losses in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, 737-9 customer considerations, production disruptions, and higher R&D expenses. Since Boeing accounts for this investment using the equity method, BCA's losses directly reduce Boeing's investment balance and are reflected in its consolidated financials. This significant operational deterioration in BCA suggests that Boeing's equity method investments are a material source of financial exposure, particularly when investee segments face major program challenges or production disruptions.",

      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment R&D spending increased from $1,965 million in 2022 to $2,314 million in 2023, a rise of $349 million or approximately 17.7%. Over the same period, the Aerospace equity method investment balance grew from $1,931 million in 2022 to $1,958 million in 2023, an increase of $27 million or about 1.4%. While R&D spending saw a significant year-over-year increase, the growth in equity method investments was more modest. This suggests that while GE is heavily investing in internal R&D\u2014particularly in areas like customer and partner-funded programs\u2014it may be taking a more measured approach to expanding its equity-based partnerships, despite the strategic importance of collaboration in aerospace innovation.",

      "answer": "From 2021 to 2023, the identifiable assets for Combat Systems decreased from $11,657 million to $10,479 million, with an intermediate value of $11,032 million in 2022. Despite this reduction in identifiable assets, the Combat Systems segment reported an increase in revenue from $7,351 million in 2021 to $8,268 million in 2023, along with a rise in operating earnings from $1,067 million to $1,147 million over the same period. This suggests that the segment improved its asset efficiency, generating higher revenue and operating earnings with fewer identifiable assets by 2023. The alignment indicates that GD may have optimized its asset utilization or streamlined operations within the Combat Systems segment, contributing to improved financial performance despite a reduction in asset base.",

      "answer": "The $1.427 billion in Oral Care sales reported in 2021 contributed to the overall 8.4% growth in MMM's Health Care segment sales. This growth was driven by higher year-on-year dental procedures, which directly benefited the Oral Care sub-segment. The Health Care segment's performance was also attributed to organic growth in areas like separation and purification, food safety, and medical solutions, indicating that Oral Care was one of several key contributors to this growth. The segment's increase was further supported by factors such as rising elective procedures and demand for biopharma filtration solutions, showing a multi-faceted growth dynamic within the Health Care business.",

      "answer": "The Consumer segment experienced a 10.3% increase in net sales and a 3.7% increase in operational income in 2021, indicating a slight margin compression, as operational income growth lagged behind sales growth. This trend contrasts with the overall company's operating income growth of 2.9%, suggesting that while the segment outperformed the company-wide profitability growth, it faced efficiency challenges in converting additional sales into proportional profit. This nuanced performance highlights the segment\u2019s mixed contribution to MMM\u2019s broader financial strategy.",

In 2024, BCA reported a significant loss from operations of $7,969 million, which was primarily attributed to lower deliveries and production disruptions, including the IAM 751 work stoppage. This aligns with the broader operational narrative that lower deliveries had a direct negative impact on BCA's profitability, reinforcing the financial exposure Boeing faces through its investment in BCA when the segment underperforms operationally.",

Despite this pressure, the company's Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment grew operating profit by 3% year-over-year. However, the Financial Products Segment, in which CAT maintains a stake, reported a significant 34% drop in profit, from $923 million in 2023 to $605 million in 2024. This decline in the Financial Products Segment contrasts with the broader company's ability to maintain a 1% consolidated operating profit growth, suggesting that CAT's core machinery and energy businesses offset some of the financial segment's underperformance.

      "question": "How does the minimal capital expenditure allocation to the FedEx Freight segment in fiscal 2022, which saw no growth compared to the prior year, align with its declining revenue contribution relative to other segments, particularly when considering the significant double-digit investments in FedEx Ground and FedEx Express?",
      "answer": "The FedEx Freight segment received only $319 million in capital expenditures in 2022, unchanged from 2021, while other segments like FedEx Ground saw a 48% increase in capital spending to $2,139 million and FedEx Express maintained a high level of investment at $3,637 million. On the revenue side, the FedEx Freight segment contributed just $319 million in 2022, down from $539 million in 2020, contrasting sharply with the growth in FedEx Ground's revenue contribution, which rose from $1,083 million in 2020 to $2,139 million in 2022. This suggests a strategic alignment where capital is being prioritized toward higher-growth or higher-margin segments like FedEx Ground and Express, while the Freight segment is receiving minimal reinvestment, potentially signaling a reduced strategic emphasis or a focus on operational efficiency within that segment.",

      "answer": "The revolving finance receivables tied to the Mining segment increased significantly from $3 in 2023 to $8 in 2024, indicating a growing credit exposure in this sector. However, the credit risk exposure for the Mining segment as of December 31, 2024, was $29 million in non-accrual with an allowance, compared to only $2 million in the prior year. This suggests that Caterpillar has not only increased its credit extension in mining markets but also experienced a rise in delinquencies or higher risk profiles in this segment. This implies a potentially aggressive credit management strategy in mining markets, with increased financing activity accompanied by higher risk provisioning.",

      "answer": "RTX faces rising material prices due to high inflation levels, which are explicitly linked to increased costs for raw materials, components, and labor. This has negatively impacted operating profit and margins, especially under fixed-price contracts where RTX cannot easily adjust pricing to reflect these cost overruns. The company notes that supply chain disruptions, including those from macroeconomic conditions like inflation and labor shortages, are expected to persist into 2024, further constraining its ability to control costs. Since a significant portion of RTX\u2019s business involves government and commercial aerospace contracts\u2014many of which are fixed-price\u2014this creates a direct risk to profitability unless mitigated through internal initiatives like digital transformation and cost reduction programs.",

      "question": "How does RTX's overall operating profit margin decline from 8.2% in 2022 to 5.2% in 2023 reconcile with Collins Aerospace's segment performance, which reported a 14.6% operating profit margin, and how does this contrast with the capital expenditures and depreciation patterns for Collins Aerospace in 2023?",
      "answer": "RTX's consolidated operating profit margin dropped from 8.2% in 2022 to 5.2% in 2023, reflecting overall operational pressure. However, Collins Aerospace, a major business segment, reported a strong 14.6% operating profit margin in 2023, outperforming the company average. This suggests that other segments, such as Pratt & Whitney (which had a negative 8.0% margin), significantly dragged down the consolidated figure. Despite Collins Aerospace's strong profitability, its capital expenditures in 2023 were $628 million, with depreciation and amortization of $724 million, indicating a mature asset base and potentially limited growth reinvestment. This contrasts with its high margin, suggesting that while the segment is profitable, its capital investment trajectory may not be aligned with aggressive expansion.",

      "answer": "The $1.3 billion organic decrease in RTX's total Cost of Sales in 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in organic Cost of Sales at Collins Aerospace due to lower sales, cost reduction initiatives, and the absence of prior-year unfavorable adjustments. This cost reduction occurred in the context of the ongoing impact of the commercial aerospace downturn caused by the pandemic, which is further detailed in a later section. On page 92, RTX notes that the decline in commercial air travel adversely affected Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney, leading to a decrease in demand for their products and services. The company continues to monitor commercial aerospace assets for recoverability, with total valuation reserves of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, the cost savings at Collins Aerospace helped offset some of the financial pressure from reduced demand, but the segment still faces long-term asset recoverability concerns tied to the commercial aerospace industry's recovery trajectory.",

T hese factors hav e reduced ov erall productiv ity and adv ersely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAirline  financial  performance,  which  influences  demand  for  new  capacity,  has  benefited  from  the  resilient  demand  for  trav el.  T he  International  Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2024 industry-wide net profits of $31.5 billion, up from its forecast of $25.7 billion a year ago, primarily driv en by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2025, IATA is forecasting $36.6 billion in net profits for the industry globally. The ov erall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the env ironment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and v olatile costs. The global economy is expecting a continued easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial v iability of some airlines and regions.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positiv e due to the fundamental driv ers of air trav el demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to trav el due to increased trade, globalization and improv ed airline serv ices driv en by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.2% growth rate in the global fleet ov er a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6%  in  av erage  annual  gross  domestic  product,  we  project  demand  for  approximately  43,975  new  airplanes  ov er  the  next  20  years.  T he  industry remains vulnerable to exogenous dev elopments including fuel price spikes, potential new or increased tariffs, changing energy policies, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global env ironmental regulations.\n\nAt BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and serv ices hav e in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S.,  we  are  seeing  similar  solid  demand  as  gov ernments  prioritize  security,  defense  technology  and  global  cooperation  giv en  ev olv ing  threats.  We continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price dev elopment programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.\n\nAt BGS, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recov ered and transitions to growth. The demand outlook for our gov ernment serv ices business remains stable.",

      "question": "How does RTX's segment-level intersegment elimination pattern involving Collins, as disclosed in the corporate expense section, reconcile with the reported $1.2 billion increase in Collins' external product sales in 2024, especially in the context of overall net product sales recovery?",
      "answer": "RTX's corporate expense section (page 53) indicates that Collins was a principal driver of increased intersegment eliminations, contributing to a $0.3 billion rise in eliminations and other net sales in 2024. This suggests Collins plays a significant role in internal transactions. However, in the segment performance section (page 41), Collins also contributed a $1.2 billion increase in external product sales in 2024, which was a key factor in the overall $10.0 billion recovery in net product sales after a prior-year decline. The dual role of Collins\u2014as both a contributor to internal eliminations and a growth engine in external sales\u2014highlights its strategic importance in RTX\u2019s revenue structure, while also exposing the company to intersegment complexity that must be carefully managed to avoid distortion in consolidated results.",

Eliminations and other operating profit in 2024 was relatively consistent with 2023.\n\nThe increase in eliminations and other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax  related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\n\n## FAS/CAS operating adjustment\n\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension ex pense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

However, RTX's consolidated operating margin declined from 10.8% in 2019 to 7.7% in 2021. This divergence can be attributed to several factors, most notably the $2,203 million in acquisition accounting adjustments that negatively impacted the consolidated operating profit in 2021. These adjustments, likely tied to purchase accounting for prior acquisitions, offset the strong performance of segments like Raytheon Missiles & Defense and reflect the broader financial pressures RTX faced during its transformation.

      "question": "How does Boeing's increase in BCA revenues by $7,875 million in 2023 align with the $706 million decrease in BCA's loss from operations, and what does this suggest about the segment's cost structure and delivery efficiency improvements?",
      "answer": "Boeing's BCA segment experienced a $7,875 million increase in revenues in 2023, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries. This revenue growth coincided with a $706 million decrease in BCA's loss from operations, which reflects both higher deliveries and lower period expenses, including reduced abnormal production costs. However, this improvement was partially offset by increased spending on research and development. The alignment between revenue growth and reduced losses indicates that the segment's cost structure is improving, particularly in production efficiency, although ongoing R&D investments continue to weigh on profitability. This dual improvement in revenue and operational loss reduction suggests that BCA is making strides in stabilizing its delivery pipeline and managing production costs more effectively.",

Cat Financial manages residual value risk through active monitoring and adjustments to depreciation or finance revenue depending on lease type (page 113).

For tax purposes, we are considered the owner of the equipment.\n\nCat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar.\n\nCat Financial's wholesale loans and leases include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.\n\nCat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment and services available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.  Our competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., Banc of America Leasing &amp; Capital LLC,  BNP  Paribas  Leasing  Solutions  Limited, Australia  and  New  Zealand  Banking  G roup  Limited,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G \u00e9n\u00e9rale  S.A.  and  various  other  banks  and  finance companies.  In addition, many of the manufacturers that compete with Caterpillar also own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P., V olvo Financial Services and Kubota Credit Corporation, which utilize many below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to support machine sales.  Cat Financial works with the broader Caterpillar organization to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs to compete around the world.\n\nThe financial results of Cat Financial are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers' willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements.  Cat Financial is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates.\n\nCat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fix ed or floating rate and duration) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis.  In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 4 - 'Derivative financial instruments and risk management' of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financial's operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option  and  cross  currency  contracts  to  offset  the  risk  of  currency  mismatch  between  the  assets  and  liabilities,  and  ex change  rate  risk  associated  with  future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nCat  Financial  provides  financing  only  when  certain  criteria  are  met.  Credit  decisions  are  based  on  a  variety  of  credit  quality  factors  including  prior  payment experience, customer financial information, credit ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment.  Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers' sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world.  Cat Financial's competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers.  Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing.  We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.",

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax  leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax  purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fix ed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

      "answer": "RTX's risk factors section on page 34 highlights that high inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs, which have negatively impacted operating profit and margin. The company notes that it cannot always offset these cost increases, especially on fixed-price contracts, which could lead to losses. However, the financial performance table on page 46 shows an overall increase in operating profit of $621 million. This apparent contradiction is partially explained by the company's strategic initiatives\u2014such as digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced technology programs\u2014mentioned in the risk factors. These initiatives likely contributed to the profit growth despite inflationary pressures. The $621 million increase in operating profit, despite the risks outlined, suggests that RTX's mitigation strategies have had a measurable positive impact, although the company still acknowledges uncertainty in fully offsetting inflationary effects.",

      "question": "Given BA's $391 million equity method investment in BCA as of 2024, how does the $1,271 million reduction in abnormal production costs during the year reconcile with BCA's reported $7,969 million operating loss, especially considering abnormal production costs are explicitly called out as a mitigating factor in the loss calculation?",
      "answer": "BA's $391 million equity method investment in BCA (as disclosed on page 85) represents its proportional stake in the Commercial Airplanes segment. According to the operational performance section (page 29), BCA's $6,334 million increase in loss from operations was 'partially offset by lower abnormal production costs.' The detailed segment reporting (page 35) quantifies this reduction at $1,271 million, which helped mitigate BCA's operating loss despite significant negative factors including $4,079 million in reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs and $443 million in 737-9 customer considerations. Without this specific cost reduction, BCA's operating loss of $7,969 million would have been even more severe, directly impacting BA's equity investment returns.",

      "question": "How does the $6.2 billion organic increase in RTX's Total Cost of Sales relate to the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition methodology used by the Pratt & Whitney segment, and what impact does this timing mismatch have on RTX's working capital requirements?",
      "answer": "The $6.2 billion organic increase in RTX's Total Cost of Sales is directly tied to higher net sales at Pratt & Whitney, where significant contracts are recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This means that while costs are incurred upfront during production, revenue is recognized gradually as progress is made, often resulting in revenue recognized in excess of billings. This timing mismatch creates a working capital requirement, as RTX must finance the gap between incurred costs and eventual customer payments, particularly under U.S. government fixed-price contracts where payments are made based on milestones or progress, not full cost recovery at each stage.",

        "Hop 1: RTX(page_41) \u2192 Total Cost of Sales: RTX reports an organic increase in total cost of sales of $6.2 billion, primarily driven by increased sales activity at Pratt & Whitney.",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

Supporting this, Caterpillar disclosed only $1 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance specifically tied to the Mining segment as of December 31, 2022.

Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.\n\n## Product Costs\n\nProduct costs increased approximately $4.6 billion, or 9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of $2.5 billion at MFC, $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $1.1 billion at RMS. Higher product costs at MFC were due to $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales'. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales' and $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about classified program losses incurred at MFC and Aeronautics. Higher product costs at RMS were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales'.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approx imately  $190  million,  or  2%,  in  2024  as  compared  to  2023.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher  service  costs  of approximately $235 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume as described above in 'Service Sales'.",

Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.\n\n## Product Costs\n\nProduct costs increased approximately $4.6 billion, or 9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of $2.5 billion at MFC, $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $1.1 billion at RMS. Higher product costs at MFC were due to $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales'. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales' and $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about classified program losses incurred at MFC and Aeronautics. Higher product costs at RMS were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in 'Product Sales'.\n\n## Service Costs\n\nService  costs  increased  approx imately  $190  million,  or  2%,  in  2024  as  compared  to  2023.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher  service  costs  of approximately $235 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume as described above in 'Service Sales'.",

      "answer": "GE's Total Segment Revenues declined significantly from $86,778 million in 2019 to $71,635 million in 2021, representing a decrease of $15.1 billion over two years. During this same period, the Healthcare Systems segment's revenues increased from $14,648 million in 2019 to $15,694 million in 2021, growing its share of total segment revenues despite the overall contraction. Furthermore, while total segment profit margin for Healthcare Systems declined from 18.7% in 2019 to 16.7% in 2021, the drop was relatively modest compared to the broader revenue decline across other segments.

      "answer": "The FedEx Express segment received $3,637 million in capital expenditures in 2022, reflecting a 4% increase from the $3,503 million in 2021. This modest growth in capital allocation aligns with the segment's own 4% year-over-year revenue growth. In contrast, the FedEx Ground segment, which saw a much higher 48% revenue increase, received a significantly larger capital allocation growth\u2014rising from $1,446 million to $2,139 million. This suggests that FedEx may be strategically aligning capital investments with relative segment performance, though the document does not explicitly state a causal relationship.

      "answer": "The 'All Other operating segment' contributed minimally to Caterpillar\u2019s 23% growth in consolidated sales and revenues between 2020 and 2021. According to the segment data from 2020 to 2021, the 'All Other' segment saw total sales increase slightly from $467 million to $511 million, representing less than 1% of total company sales in both years. This flat contribution contrasts with the overall 23% growth in consolidated sales and revenues, which was driven by stronger performance in the core segments\u2014especially North America and Latin America\u2014where end-user demand and favorable price realization significantly boosted sales. Additionally, dealer inventory changes, which had a pronounced impact on overall sales growth, did not appear to materially influence the 'All Other' segment\u2019s performance, suggesting its role in the broader growth narrative was limited.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(page_134) \u2192 All Other operating segment: The segment\u2019s sales and revenues increased marginally from $467 million in 2020 to $511 million in 2021, with minimal regional variation.",
        "Hop 2: All Other operating segment \u2192 Sales and Revenues: The segment contributes a small portion of total sales and shows little growth, indicating limited influence on overall revenue trends.",
        "Hop 3: Sales and Revenues \u2190 CAT(page_40): Consolidated sales and revenues grew by 23% from $11.235 billion to $13.798 billion, driven by higher end-user demand, favorable pricing, and dealer inventory dynamics, particularly in North America and Latin America."

The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's record operating ratio improvement in 2021 relate to the specific contribution of core pricing gains, given the detailed revenue composition and market recovery context provided in the freight revenue analysis?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific achieved a record operating ratio of 57.2% in 2021, reflecting a 2.7-point improvement driven in part by core pricing gains. These core pricing gains were a key contributor to the 11% year-over-year increase in freight revenues, which reached $20.2 billion. The freight revenue growth was attributed to a 4% volume increase, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic, particularly in industrial shipments with higher average revenue per carload (ARC). The operating ratio improvement was also influenced by productivity initiatives and the recovery from the depressed 2020 pandemic levels, although this was partially offset by inflation and cost increases. Therefore, the core pricing gains served as a bridge between operational efficiency (as reflected in the operating ratio) and strategic revenue growth levers tied to market recovery and pricing discipline.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues  vary  with  volume  (carloads)  and  ARC.  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  drive  ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes,  are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer  incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  volumes,  and  recognized  as  the  related  performance  obligation  is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue  between  reporting  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Accessorial  revenues  are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge  revenue,  core  pricing  gains,  and  positive  mix  of  traffic  (for  example,  a  relative  increase  in  industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery  from  the  depressed  economy  brought  on  by  the  COVID  pandemic  in  2020.  While  the  markets  have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  revenues  of  $1.7  billion  and  $1.0  billion  in  2021  and  2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in  carloadings,  partially  offset  by  the  lag  impact  on  fuel  surcharge  (it  can  generally  take  up  to  two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\n\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive  production  offset  the  recovery  from  other  COVID  related  declines  in  2020.  Accessorial  revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.",

This suggests that UPS is applying a relatively stable interest credit rate to its international pension obligations, which could impact the growth of these benefits over time. The modest increase in the credit rate from 2020 to 2021 (2.74% to 2.94%) indicates a cautious approach to assumed returns, which aligns with the company's moderate contribution levels to these plans.",

During the same year, the company also recognized a pretax loss of $113 million on derivatives, primarily from foreign currency and interest rate contracts.

This suggests a potential disparity between the segment's operational importance\u2014evidenced by the high volume of internal sales\u2014and RTX\u2019s capital allocation, which may reflect strategic decisions about segment ownership or financial structuring.

      "answer": "The increase in Collins Aerospace's inter-segment sales from $1,959 million in 2023 to $2,355 million in 2024\u2014a $396 million rise\u2014suggests a growing level of internal collaboration and integration within RTX\u2019s business segments. This upward trend indicates that Collins Aerospace is increasingly relying on or supplying other internal RTX segments, which could point to deeper operational synergies or shared technology platforms. However, the fact that inter-segment sales are netted out in the business segment sales reporting (as shown in the reconciliation on page 115) implies that RTX is carefully managing internal transactions to avoid double-counting revenue. This balance\u2014between promoting internal collaboration while maintaining transparent financial reporting\u2014reflects a strategic effort to optimize integration without distorting segment performance metrics.",

      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment reported $6,681 million in billings in excess of revenues, indicating that it invoiced customers more than it recognized in revenue during the period. This discrepancy contributes to deferred revenue and other contract liabilities, which are reflected in the non-current contract and other deferred assets of $5,032 million for the Aerospace segment. Furthermore, the company disclosed that payments were made to customers, primarily within Aerospace, suggesting that some of these deferred assets may represent incentives or other forms of customer compensation that delay revenue recognition. This dynamic illustrates a structural timing lag between billing and revenue recognition, driven by contract terms and customer payment arrangements.",

      "question": "How does MMM's disclosure of its postretirement benefit obligation changes in 2023 relate to the projected 2027 benefit payments, and what does this imply about the company's long-term liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "MMM reported a postretirement benefit obligation of $1,897 million at the end of 2023, which increased from $1,797 million in 2022 due to factors like service cost, interest cost, and actuarial losses. This growing liability is contrasted with the company's projected 2027 benefit payments of $160 million for postretirement benefits, indicating that while the overall liability is rising, the annual cash outflows for these benefits are expected to remain relatively modest. This suggests MMM may be managing its long-term postretirement liabilities through a combination of funding strategies and controlled benefit disbursements.",

        "Hop 1: MMM(page_68) \u2192 Postretirement Benefits: MMM reports a postretirement benefit obligation of $1,897 million at the end of 2023, up from $1,797 million in 2022, driven by service cost, interest cost, and actuarial gains/losses.",
        "Hop 2: Postretirement Benefits \u2192 2027 Benefit Payments: The long-term benefit obligation includes projected annual payments, with 2027 showing a payment of $160 million for postretirement benefits.",

      "question": "How does the impact of the 2023 discount rate decrease on pension obligations reconcile with the projected $16 million decrease in 2025 pension ongoing expense, given the volatility in mark-to-market adjustments observed in recent years?",
      "answer": "The 2023 actuarial losses were primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate, which increased pension obligations. According to the sensitivity table, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate is projected to decrease 2025 pension ongoing expense by $16 million, despite increasing the projected benefit obligation by $222 million. However, this projected decrease in ongoing expense must be viewed in light of the significant volatility in mark-to-market (MTM) adjustments in recent years, which were $126 million in 2024, $153 million in 2023, and $523 million in 2022. These MTM adjustments, which are sensitive to changes in discount rates and asset returns, suggest that while the ongoing expense may decrease in the short term due to the updated assumptions, the actual financial impact could be more volatile and less predictable due to the accounting treatment of actuarial gains and losses.",

Net actuarial gains or losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains or losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast M TM  A djustments. These adjustments resulted in expenses of $126 million, $153 million, and $523 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future  market  conditions  and  asset  mix  considerations  (see  Note  20 Pension  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits  of  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.25% for 2025, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2024.\n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 5.57% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.\n\nIn addition to the potential for M TM  A djustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affect future Pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, with all other assumptions remaining constant. These estimates exclude any potential M TM  A djustment:\n\n",

      "answer": "Collins Aerospace Systems' product sales increased from $14,664 million in 2020 to $16,990 million in 2021, reflecting a growth of $2,326 million. Over the same period, RTX's total consolidated net sales rose from $56,587 million to $64,388 million, an increase of $7,801 million. This indicates that Collins Aerospace Systems contributed significantly to RTX's overall revenue growth, accounting for nearly 30% of the company's total increase in consolidated net sales.

      "answer": "UPS experienced a significant drop in the operating profit of its U.S. Domestic Package segment, falling from $6,997 million in 2022 to $5,076 million in 2023, driven by volume declines and labor cost pressures. Despite this financial underperformance, the company explicitly states that it did not record any goodwill impairment charges in this segment during the past two years. This absence of impairment recognition suggests that, despite short-term profitability challenges, UPS still views the long-term value and earning potential of its U.S. Domestic Package operations as intact. This contrast highlights a strategic judgment that current declines are temporary and do not warrant an adjustment to asset values on the balance sheet.",

      "answer": "The $210 million in Licensing and Royalty Income reported in 2024 is a component of Other Segment Expenses (income), which also includes equity method income and interest income. This categorization suggests that GE treats Licensing and Royalty Income not as a core operating revenue stream but rather as part of broader, non-operational segment expenses. The explicit inclusion of this income within Other Segment Expenses indicates a structural choice in GE's financial reporting to classify certain income streams as offsets to segment expenses rather than standalone revenue, reflecting a consolidated view of non-core financial activities.",

      "question": "Given the GE Energy Pension Plan's $748 million funding deficit and identical long-term annualized returns compared to the GE Aerospace Pension Plan, what factors might explain the disparity in their funding statuses?",
      "answer": "The GE Energy Pension Plan shows a $748 million funding deficit despite achieving annualized returns of 6.6% over one year and 5.2% over five years. This is comparable to the GE Aerospace Pension Plan, which has a significantly larger $2,184 million deficit but similar returns of 6.5% over one year and 5.2% over five years. The disparity in funding status despite similar investment performance suggests that differences in the benefit obligations or asset bases may be driving the contrast. Specifically, the GE Energy Pension Plan has a benefit obligation of $10,239 million with assets of $9,491 million, resulting in a smaller asset base relative to its liability compared to Aerospace, which has a larger obligation of $22,437 million but slightly more assets at $20,253 million. This indicates that while both plans generate similar returns, the Energy plan may face greater funding pressure due to a less favorable asset-to-liability ratio.",

      "answer": "The divestiture of the InSinkErator business, which generated $152 million in pretax earnings in fiscal 2022, was completed in October 2022, after the fiscal year-end of September 30, 2022. As a result, these pretax earnings were included in Emerson\u2019s full-year results. However, the significant pretax earnings growth of $1,173 million for the year was primarily driven by gains from the Vertiv distribution and the Therm-O-Disc divestiture, which contributed $453 million and $486 million in pretax gains, respectively. While the InSinkErator business contributed meaningfully to Emerson\u2019s earnings during the year, its divestiture did not reduce the reported pretax earnings for fiscal 2022 since it occurred after the fiscal year-end. Instead, the proceeds from the sale are reflected post-period and are expected to influence future financial positioning and capital allocation strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## INVESTMENT AND DIVESTITURE GAINS\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold cash return on their initial investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.\n\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.\n\n## INTEREST EXPENSE, NET\n\nInterest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\n\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.",

      "answer": "GE transferred $4.2 billion in postretirement benefit liabilities, including pensions and retiree health and life benefits, to GE HealthCare as part of the January 2023 separation, which are now reported in discontinued operations. This transfer significantly reduced GE's ongoing benefit obligations. However, GE still retains indemnification commitments for GE HealthCare under the Tax Matters Agreement, including $41 million in obligations for which reserves have been fully established. This indicates that while the bulk of the liability was transferred, GE remains exposed to certain long-term financial obligations tied to GE HealthCare, albeit at a much smaller scale.",

      "question": "What is the net impact of long-term service agreements on GE's Aerospace segment profitability, and how does this relate to the payments made to customers disclosed in the deferred asset section?",
      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment reports long-term service agreements (LTSAs) with a net negative balance of $4,318 million as of December 31, 2022, indicating deferred costs exceeding recognized revenue. This suggests that the segment has incurred significant upfront costs related to LTSAs that have not yet been recovered through billings or revenue recognition. Furthermore, the deferred asset section reveals that payments made to customers, primarily within Aerospace, are a material component of the segment\u2019s balance sheet. These payments, which are likely tied to LTSAs, contribute to the segment\u2019s non-current deferred assets of $5,032 million. The negative LTSA balance combined with substantial customer payments implies that Aerospace's long-term service contracts are capital-intensive and may compress near-term profitability, with returns expected over a longer horizon.",

On the financial side, the segment reported $19,286 million in identifiable assets in 2024, a slight decline from prior years. Comparing these two perspectives, the segment maintains a relatively low physical footprint while carrying a significant amount of identifiable assets, suggesting that the Technologies segment may be less facility-dependent and more asset-heavy in other forms, such as intellectual property or equipment. This contrasts with segments like Marine Systems and Combat Systems, which have larger physical footprints but lower identifiable asset values, indicating potentially different capital intensity profiles.",

      "answer": "Despite a significant decline in FedEx Freight Segment's revenue from $539 million in 2020 to $320 million in 2021, the segment's goodwill balance remained unchanged at $634 million from May 31, 2020, to May 31, 2021.

      "question": "Given Caterpillar's allocation of $2.75 billion in credit facility availability to ME&T in 2021, how does the relative foreign exchange volatility experienced by Financial Products during the 2019-2021 period suggest differing liquidity risk profiles between the two segments, especially considering Caterpillar's explicit distinction between ME&T and Financial Products in its supplemental consolidating data?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar allocated $2.75 billion of its total $10.50 billion credit facility to ME&T as of December 31, 2021, indicating a significant liquidity support for this segment. However, during the 2019-2021 period, Financial Products experienced greater foreign exchange volatility, with gains or losses fluctuating from a $37 million loss in 2019 to an $89 million gain in 2021. In contrast, ME&T's foreign exchange gains were more stable, ranging from $13 million to $38 million over the same period. This suggests that Financial Products faced more pronounced currency risk compared to ME&T. Caterpillar's internal reporting structure explicitly separates these segments, noting that 'The nature of the ME&T and Financial Products businesses is different,' particularly in terms of financial position and cash flow. Therefore, despite the explicit liquidity support to ME&T, Financial Products' higher FX volatility indicates a potentially greater need for liquidity buffers to manage its distinct financial risks.",

This strategic intent was aligned with the actual financial performance, where the International Package segment reported double-digit revenue per piece growth. The drivers of this increase included fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix, and favorable currency movements. These specific factors, outlined in the financial results and elaborated further in the detailed revenue analysis, demonstrated that the execution of the value share strategy successfully translated into measurable revenue per piece gains, particularly through pricing discipline, customer mix optimization, and surcharge mechanisms.",

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), founded in 1907, is the world's premier package delivery company and a leading provider of global supply chain management solutions. We offer a broad range of industry-leading products and services through our extensive presence in North America; Europe; the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa ('ISMEA'); Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our services include transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage and insurance.\n\nWe operate one of the largest airlines and one of the largest fleets of alternative fuel vehicles under a global UPS brand. We deliver packages each business day for approximately 1.7 million shipping customers to 11.8 million delivery customers in over 220 countries and territories. In 2021, we delivered an average of 25.2 million packages per day, totaling 6.4 billion packages during the year. Total revenue in 2021 was $97.3 billion.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur well-defined strategy focuses on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including business-to-business (\"B2B\"), healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") and large enterprise accounts. We are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy as we transform our business.\n\nCustomer First is about reducing the friction of doing business. We help our customers seize new opportunities, compete, and succeed by delivering the capabilities that they tell us matter the most: speed and ease.\n\nPeople Led specifically focuses on how likely an employee is to recommend UPS employment to a friend or family member. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture, so we are striving to make UPS a great place to work. Through our transformation initiatives, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. We are also enhancing the employee value proposition to align with evolving market practices.\n\nInnovation Driven is designed to optimize the volume that flows through our network, to focus on increasing value share and driving business growth from higher-yielding opportunities in our target markets. We are using technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network. In our United States (\" U.S.\") Domestic Package segment, our aim is to improve revenue mix and lower our cost to serve. Within the International Package segment and Supply Chain Solutions businesses, we are focused on value share gains and growing operating profit.",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did RTX reconcile the Raytheon Merger's $399 million contribution to operating profit with the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment's 79.7% year-over-year increase in operating profit, especially in light of the $900 million backlog adjustment caused by the divestiture of its global training and services business?",
      "answer": "RTX reported that the $399 million contribution from the Raytheon Merger was a key driver of the overall increase in operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020. On page 119, the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment saw its operating profit rise from $1,020 million in 2020 to $1,833 million in 2021, a 79.7% increase. However, this growth occurred alongside a $900 million decrease in backlog, partly due to the divestiture of RIS's global training and services business in December 2021, which also contributed a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs. This suggests that despite the reduction in backlog from the divestiture, the segment experienced strong performance in core areas, such as classified contracts like the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) for the F-35 program and the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Mid-Band LRIP contract with the U.S. Navy. Therefore, while the divestiture reduced backlog, it contributed positively to operating profit and may have allowed the segment to focus on higher-value programs, aligning with the overall profitability growth.",

The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $0.8 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020, were primarily due to the change in Acquisitions / divestitures, net of $399 million, primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, an increase in mix and other performance of $292 million primarily due to a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of RIS's global training and services business in December 2021, as further discussed in 'Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the net favorable change in EAC adjustments of $132 million, which was primarily driven by the absence of $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in 2020.\n\n## 2020 Compared with 2019\n\nThe increase in net sales of $11.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.\n\nThe increase in operating profit of $1.0 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 were due  to  the  Raytheon  Merger.  Included  in  operating  profit  in  2020  were  $124  million  of  unfavorable  EAC  adjustments  for  loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position, of which $87 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nBacklog and Bookings - Backlog was $18 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $19 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in the decrease in backlog was a $0.9 billion adjustment related to the sale of RIS's global training and services business discussed above. In 2021, RIS booked $4.8 billion on a number of classified contracts, $672 million of Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) products and services contracts in the fourth quarter of 2021 including the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) for  the  F35  Joint  Strike  Fighter  program,  $419  million  on  the  Next  Generation  Jammer  (NGJ)  Mid-Band  Low  Rate  Initial Production (LRIP) contract with the U.S. Navy, $365 million on the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) program for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $227 million on a missile warning and defense contract, $211 million to provide additional upgrades to the Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control System (GPS OCX) program for  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  $199  million  on  an  international  tactical  airborne  radar  sustainment  contract,  and  $185  million  on  an international training contract with the U.K. Royal Navy.\n\n## Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense\n\n",

      "question": "What insight does CAT's $15 million foreign exchange gain from the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment in 2021 provide about their exposure to currency risk in trade receivables, and how does this compare with Cat Financial's financing activities related to Receivables - Trade and Other as of year-end 2021?",
      "answer": "CAT's $15 million foreign exchange gain in 2021 from the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment indicates active currency exposure related to international operations and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. This is further substantiated by the segment's $58 million in Receivables - Trade and Other and $28 million in Long-term Receivables - Trade and Other as of December 31, 2021, showing a significant portion of assets exposed to currency fluctuations. In contrast, Cat Financial's financing activities included $1,098 million in wholesale inventory receivables categorized under Receivables - Trade and Other as of the same date, suggesting that while the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment manages currency risk on a smaller base of trade receivables, the Financial Products segment holds a much larger volume of receivables with different risk characteristics primarily related to credit and financing rather than foreign exchange.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Financial Products segment, primarily operated through Cat Financial, faces credit risk from delinquencies that could increase under adverse economic conditions, leading to higher provisions for credit losses as noted on page 21. This risk is compounded by the sensitivity of Cat Financial's leasing operations\u2014detailed on page 128\u2014to residual value estimation, which also depends on market conditions, including demand, usage, and economic trends. On page 22, it is emphasized that economic deterioration could simultaneously increase delinquencies and reduce the value of leased assets, thereby negatively impacting both credit performance and asset valuation. This dual exposure suggests that a downturn could have a compounding negative effect on Cat Financial\u2019s earnings and cash flows, as both credit losses and lower residual values would be triggered by the same macroeconomic factors.",

The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium- term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature. Cat Financial also could and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions.  Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial's business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:\n\n- Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could increase Cat Financial's write-offs and provision for credit losses.\n- The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management's judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.\n- Cat Financial's ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to engage or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n- As Cat Financial's lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of our underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.",

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.  LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"), the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While the November 30 announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established if LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be established.  The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial's borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.  With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\n\nInherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\n\nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.",

Cat  Financial  leases  to  customers  primarily  through  sales-type  (non-tax)  leases,  where  the  lessee  for  tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the  lease.  For  tax  purposes,  Cat  Financial  is  considered  the  owner  of  the  equipment.  Our  lease  agreements  may  include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale  market  sales  prices,  past  remarketing  experience  and  any  known  significant  market/product  trends.    We  also consider  the  following  critical  factors  in  our  residual  value  estimates:  lease  term,  market  size  and  demand,  total  expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring  the  term  of  our  leases,  we  monitor  residual  values.    For  operating  leases,  we  record  adjustments  to  depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "The FedEx Express Segment saw modest revenue growth from $3.503 billion in 2021 to $3.637 billion in 2022, an increase of $134 million or approximately 2.1%. However, this period also saw a significant reduction in goodwill for the segment\u2014declining from $5,358 million as of May 31, 2021, to $4,925 million as of May 31, 2022\u2014a decrease of $433 million. This goodwill reduction, unlike the revenue trend, suggests a revaluation or impairment of the segment's intangible value relative to expectations or performance benchmarks. In contrast, FedEx Ground experienced goodwill growth during the same period, indicating a divergence in how the company is valuing its different business units. This contrast implies that despite top-line growth, FedEx may view the Express segment as underperforming relative to expectations or as facing structural challenges that reduce its long-term strategic value compared to other segments.",

Backlog is defined as the value of firm orders for which products or services have not yet been delivered. The defense segment alone contributed a significant portion of this growth, with defense backlog rising from $69 billion to $78 billion. This aligns with the firm orders disclosed in the document, which are the foundation of backlog and represent binding commitments from customers. The increase in defense backlog suggests strong ongoing demand from government clients, which likely constitutes a large portion of the firm orders.

      "answer": "MMM's Safety and Industrial segment reported flat sales in 2024 but experienced a decline in Industrial Specialties Sales, which fell to $1.137 billion in 2024 from $1.180 billion in 2023. Despite this drop, the segment's operating income margins increased year-on-year, driven by productivity gains and spending discipline. This suggests that while certain markets within the segment, such as Industrial Specialties, faced headwinds\u2014likely due to reduced discretionary spending and softer e-commerce activity\u2014cost control and operational efficiency helped offset revenue pressures. The strategic emphasis on productivity appears to have mitigated the impact of declining sales in this sub-category, supporting overall margin expansion within the Safety and Industrial segment.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's derivative contracts within Financial Products operate under ISDA master netting agreements that allow for net settlement of derivative obligations, which limits credit loss exposure to only the gains recorded but not yet received in cash. This net settlement mechanism directly affects how intersegment transactions with ME&T are accounted for, as evidenced by the elimination of equity profit earned from Financial Products' subsidiaries partially owned by ME&T subsidiaries. Additionally, the consolidated reporting on page 55 confirms that Caterpillar eliminates equity profit and noncontrolling interest profit between these segments, reinforcing the need to reconcile the derivative risk exposure in Financial Products with the intercompany profit eliminations involving ME&T.",

      "question": "How did GE Aerospace's $1.82 billion capital contribution to run-off insurance subsidiaries in 2024 impact its postretirement benefit liabilities position, especially considering its minimal 0.8% allocation to GE securities in pension plan assets?",
      "answer": "GE Aerospace made a final capital contribution of $1.82 billion to its run-off insurance subsidiaries in Q1 2024, as part of its obligation under capital maintenance agreements to maintain statutory capital levels at 300% of risk-based requirements. This contribution reflects ongoing liability exposure tied to its retained postretirement benefit obligations following the 2023 legal split of liabilities among GE HealthCare, GE Vernova, and GE Aerospace. Despite this significant capital outflow, GE Aerospace's retained postretirement benefit liabilities are managed in part through pension plan assets, which had only a 0.8% allocation to GE securities as of December 31, 2024. This low direct investment exposure suggests a strategic separation between corporate financial commitments and pension asset risk, potentially mitigating further balance sheet volatility from underfunded liabilities.",

Included in these amounts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are unfavorable adjustments of $109 million and $335 million, respectively, due to insufficient gross premiums (i.e., net premium ratio exceeded 100%), related to certain cohorts in our long-term care and life insurance portfolios. These adjustments are primarily attributable to increases in the net premium ratio as a result of updating future cash flow assumptions on cohorts where the beginning of the period net premium ratio exceeded 100%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, policyholders account balances totaled $1,574 million and $1,725 million, respectively. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, changes in policyholder account balances for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are primarily attributed to surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit payments of $432 million and $489 million, partially offset by net additions from separate accounts and interest credited of $276 million and $245 million, respectively. Interest on policyholder account balances is generally credited at minimum guaranteed rates, primarily between 3.0% and 6.0% at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nReinsurance recoveries are recorded as a reduction of Insurance losses, annuity benefits and other costs in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) and amounted to $104 million, $108 million and $321 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances of insignificant amounts, are included in non-current A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position, and amounted to $216 million and $213 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nStatutory accounting practices, not GA A P, determine the required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities. Statutory accounting practices are set forth by the National A ssociation of Insurance Commissioners as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from GAAP. We annually perform statutory asset adequacy testing, the results of which may affect the amount or timing of capital contributions from GE A erospace to the insurance legal entities.\n\nFollowing approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department, we have since provided a total of $15,035 million of capital contributions to our run-off insurance subsidiaries, including the final contribution of $1,820 million in the first quarter of 2024. GE Aerospace is a party to capital maintenance agreements with its run-off insurance subsidiaries under which GE A erospace is required to maintain their statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end A uthorized Control Level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the NA IC.\n\nIn June 2024, we signed an agreement to exit our Canadian life and health insurance portfolio, which had reserves of $213 million at December 31, 2024, via an assumption reinsurance transaction. We received regulatory approval in December 2024 and expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1, 3 and 9 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations.\n\n## NOTE 13. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\nPENSION BENEFITS AND RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. Smaller pension plans with pension assets or obligations that have not reached $50 million and other retiree benefit plans are not presented.\n\nEffectiv e January 1, 2023, certain postretirement benefit plans and liabilities were legally split or allocated between GE HealthCare, GE V ernova and GE Aerospace. In connection with the separations, net liabilities associated with GE's postretirement benefit plans, including a portion of the principal pension plans, other pension plans and the principal retiree benefit plans, were transferred to GE HealthCare and GE V ernova and are now reported in discontinued operations. See Note 2 for more information regarding the separations. The amounts that remain with GE A erospace following the separations are shown as continuing operations in the aggregate rather than for each remaining split plan. A ssumptions used in calculations, estimates of future benefit payments and funding, and other forward looking statements are for continuing operations unless otherwise noted.",

These adjustments are primarily attributable to increases in the net premium ratio as a result of updating future cash flow assumptions on cohorts where the beginning of the period net premium ratio exceeded 100%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, policyholders account balances totaled $1,574 million and $1,725 million, respectively. A s our insurance operations are in run-off, changes in policyholder account balances for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are primarily attributed to surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit payments of $432 million and $489 million, partially offset by net additions from separate accounts and interest credited of $276 million and $245 million, respectively. Interest on policyholder account balances is generally credited at minimum guaranteed rates, primarily between 3.0% and 6.0% at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nReinsurance recoveries are recorded as a reduction of Insurance losses, annuity benefits and other costs in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) and amounted to $104 million, $108 million and $321 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances of insignificant amounts, are included in non-current A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position, and amounted to $216 million and $213 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nStatutory accounting practices, not GA A P, determine the required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities. Statutory accounting practices are set forth by the National A ssociation of Insurance Commissioners as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from GAAP. We annually perform statutory asset adequacy testing, the results of which may affect the amount or timing of capital contributions from GE A erospace to the insurance legal entities.\n\nFollowing approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department, we have since provided a total of $15,035 million of capital contributions to our run-off insurance subsidiaries, including the final contribution of $1,820 million in the first quarter of 2024. GE Aerospace is a party to capital maintenance agreements with its run-off insurance subsidiaries under which GE A erospace is required to maintain their statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end A uthorized Control Level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the NA IC.\n\nIn June 2024, we signed an agreement to exit our Canadian life and health insurance portfolio, which had reserves of $213 million at December 31, 2024, via an assumption reinsurance transaction. We received regulatory approval in December 2024 and expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1, 3 and 9 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations.\n\n## NOTE 13. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\nPENSION BENEFITS AND RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. Smaller pension plans with pension assets or obligations that have not reached $50 million and other retiree benefit plans are not presented.\n\nEffectiv e January 1, 2023, certain postretirement benefit plans and liabilities were legally split or allocated between GE HealthCare, GE V ernova and GE Aerospace. In connection with the separations, net liabilities associated with GE's postretirement benefit plans, including a portion of the principal pension plans, other pension plans and the principal retiree benefit plans, were transferred to GE HealthCare and GE V ernova and are now reported in discontinued operations. See Note 2 for more information regarding the separations. The amounts that remain with GE A erospace following the separations are shown as continuing operations in the aggregate rather than for each remaining split plan. A ssumptions used in calculations, estimates of future benefit payments and funding, and other forward looking statements are for continuing operations unless otherwise noted.",

Despite these losses, Boeing continues to invest in the BCA segment, as evidenced by the $391 million investment balance listed under 'Other' equity method investments in 2024.

      "question": "Given Lockheed Martin's increasing net sales in its Space segment from 2022 to 2023, how does the company's discussion of contract risk factors on fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts reconcile with the relatively modest growth in the Space segment's operating profit?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's Space segment saw net sales increase from $11,532 million in 2022 to $12,605 million in 2023, a growth of $1,073 million. However, the segment's operating profit only rose modestly from $1,057 million to $1,158 million, an increase of $101 million. This suggests that while sales grew significantly, profitability did not scale proportionally. One explanation for this disparity lies in the company's discussion of contract risks, particularly for fixed-price contracts, which expose LMT to cost overruns that can reduce margins and operating profit. The Space segment likely operates under a significant number of such contracts, where technical complexity and cost estimation challenges can suppress profitability despite revenue growth. This indicates that contract risk factors, especially those tied to fixed-price arrangements, are negatively impacting the operating profit of the Space segment.",

        "Hop 3: [Operating Profit] \u2190 [LMT](page_13): LMT notes that fixed-price contracts carry significant risk, as cost overruns can reduce margins and operating profit, especially for complex development programs."

This retention of liabilities directly affects the funding status of GE\u2019s continuing operations' benefit plans, as the company continues to report the funding levels of these retained obligations. Specifically, the $4.2 billion in net postretirement benefit plan liabilities allocated to GE Energy and GE Aerospace (from page 61) remain on GE\u2019s balance sheet, influencing the funding status disclosed on page 62.

      "answer": "Caterpillar reported $11 million in Pre-TDR Amortized Cost for the Mining segment in 2021, indicating its direct exposure to receivables from this sector. However, within the credit quality disclosures, it is noted that the Mining segment contributed $14 million to the 91+ still accruing balances as of December 31, 2021. This suggests that a significant portion of Caterpillar's Mining receivables were already showing signs of potential credit risk, as 91+ still accruing balances represent accounts where there is uncertainty about the collectability of the full amount.

      "answer": "In 2021, Caterpillar's Corporate Items and Eliminations segment reported a negative contribution of $413 million to total sales and revenues, as disclosed in the annual consolidated report. This contrasts sharply with the overall positive growth in total sales and revenues, which increased by $2.563 billion or 23% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. This divergence indicates that the core business segments\u2014Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy & Transportation\u2014were the primary drivers of Caterpillar's revenue growth, with strong performance across all regions, particularly North America and Latin America. The negative contribution from Corporate Items and Eliminations likely reflects intercompany eliminations and other adjustments that do not represent operating performance, underscoring that Caterpillar's growth was driven by its operational segments rather than corporate-level adjustments.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "question": "How does Boeing's operational recovery in the BCA segment in 2021, driven by resumed 737 MAX deliveries, reconcile with the ongoing legal and financial liabilities related to the 737 MAX program disclosed in the litigation section?",
      "answer": "Boeing's BCA segment showed operational recovery in 2021, with a $7,372 million reduction in losses attributed to the resumption of 737 MAX deliveries and lower customer considerations. However, this recovery must be viewed in the context of significant ongoing liabilities tied to the 737 MAX program, including a $2,510 million Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and unresolved legal actions related to the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents. These liabilities, which include criminal penalties, victim compensation, and airline customer reimbursements, indicate that while short-term operational performance improved, long-term financial exposure from the 737 MAX crisis continued to pose material risks to the company's financial position and legal exposure.",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

The pension liability sensitivity analysis shows that a 25 basis point decrease in the actual return on assets increases UPS's pension liability.
