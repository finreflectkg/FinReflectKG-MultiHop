This includes $145 million from the income statement and $31 million from the cash flow statement.

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the two amounts ($145 million + $31 million = $176 million) provides the total charges related to the cost reduction program across both financial statements. The relatively small cash outflow compared to the total charge indicates that a large portion of these charges were non-cash expenses, aligning with strategic cost management efforts."

      "question": "How did Linde's 2024 cost reduction program charges compare in magnitude to the combined 2023 charges and the specific impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 2022 charges, particularly considering the $787 million loss from deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "Linde's 2024 cost reduction program charges were $145 million. This compares to $40 million in 2023 charges and a significantly higher $1 billion in 2022 charges, which included a $787 million loss from deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The combined 2023 and 2022 charges totaled $1.04 billion, making the 2024 charges only 13.9% of that amount. This highlights how the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 caused an exceptional spike in cost reduction program expenses compared to both the prior and subsequent years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Cost reduction program and other charges were $145 million and $40 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Cost reduction program and other charges were $1 billion ($896 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the year ended December 31, 2022, largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.' and 'The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax).'",
        "Step 3: Calculate comparison - $145 million (2024 charges) vs. $40 million (2023 charges) + $1 billion (2022 charges) = $1.04 billion",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 led to an exceptional $787 million loss from deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries, which was a major component of the $1 billion total cost reduction charges for that year, making 2022 an outlier compared to both 2023 and 2024"

Volumes were flat, as new project start-ups were largely offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers decreased sales by 1%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\nCost of sales, ex clusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $349 million, or 2%, for the year primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 51.9% and 53.2% of sales, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG &amp;A\") increased $42 million, or 1%, from $3,295 million in 2023 to $3,337 million in 2024 driven by higher costs. SG &amp;A was 10.1% of sales in 2024 versus 10.0% in 2023. Currency impacts decreased SG&amp;A by approximately $28 million in 2024.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $36 million, or 1%, versus 2023. The decrease is due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger partially offset by the net impact of new project start ups.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $32 million, or 1%, versus 2023. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $17 million in 2024. Ex cluding currency, underlying depreciation and amortization increased due to the net impact of new project start ups.\n\n## Cost reduction program and other charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million and $40 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2024 includes severance charges of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and other benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. In 2023, the costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, these charges have been excluded in both periods.\n\n## Other income (expense) - net\n\nReported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of $185 million in 2024 and expense of $41 million in 2023. In 2024, other income included a benefit of $41 million related to a settlement with a supplier in the Americas and $45 million in insurance recoveries primarily within the Other segment (Note 7).\n\n## Operating profit",

The fair value of property, plant &amp; equipment, net was based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The cost approach, adjusted for the age and condition of the property, plant and equipment, was used to estimate fair value.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer relationships of approximately $245 million that will be amortized over their estimated useful life of 20 years. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from nexAir, LLC's existing customer base. There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets identified in conjunction with the acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the consideration for the acquisition over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition resulted in $485 million of goodwill, the majority of which is ex pected to be deductible for tax  purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and operating synergies expected to result from the acquisition. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was allocated to the Americas reportable segment, which represents the reportable segment anticipated to experience operating synergies as a result of the acquisition.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales were $170 million, $70 million, and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## 2022 Sale of GIST business\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its GIST business. Proceeds from the sale were $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $21 million (benefit of $3 million, after tax ), recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 3).\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAM AND OTHER CHARGES\n\n## 2024 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Costs include severance of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and a benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2024 included an income tax benefit of $35 million.\n\n## 2023 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2023 included an income tax benefit of $81 million primarily comprised of a benefit of $124 million related to the resolution of an income tax audit, partially offset by an accrual of $85 million for the potential settlement of an international income tax  matter.\n\n## 2022 Charges\n\nCost  reduction  program  and  other  charges  were  $1  billion  ($896  million,  after  tax   and  noncontrolling  interests)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., have imposed several tranches of economic sanctions on Russia. As a result, Linde reassessed its ability to control its Russian subsidiaries and determined that as of June 30, 2022 it can no longer ex ercise control over these entities. As such, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax ).\n\nThe fair value of Linde's Russian subsidiaries was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, which resulted in the recognition of a $407 million loss on deconsolidation when compared to the carrying value of the entities. This loss is recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statements of income.",

      "answer": "The total net cash impact from issuances and purchases of ordinary shares for Linde plc in 2024 is -$4,451 million (issuances of $31 million minus purchases of $4,482 million). This net cash outflow is a significant component of the overall net cash used for financing activities, which totaled $4,359 million.

      "question": "By how much did purchase accounting adjustments from the Linde AG merger increase adjusted pre-tax income relative to adjusted net income in 2023, and why does this difference matter for investor analysis?",
      "answer": "Purchase accounting adjustments from the Linde AG merger increased adjusted pre-tax income by $990 million and adjusted net income by $818 million in 2023. This results in a $172 million higher impact on pre-tax income compared to net income. The difference matters because the adjustments are subject to tax implications, as noted in the tax reconciliation, where the tax effect of purchase accounting adjustments reduces the net income impact. Investors need to understand how these non-GAAP adjustments influence financial performance before and after taxes to assess the company's true operational results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The company explains that purchase accounting adjustments impact both pre-tax and after-tax financial metrics, and that tax effects are applied based on jurisdiction-specific rates, which affects how adjustments influence net income versus pre-tax income.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The quantitative impact of purchase accounting adjustments on adjusted pre-tax income is $990 million, while the impact on adjusted net income is $818 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $172 million difference between the pre-tax and net income adjustments reflects the tax effect applied to the purchase accounting impacts, which investors must understand to properly interpret non-GAAP performance metrics."
