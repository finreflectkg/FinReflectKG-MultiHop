      "answer": "The total cumulative (charge)/credit to investment in equity companies for ExxonMobil from 2019 to 2021 is $91 million (sum of -$19 million in 2019, -$110 million in 2020, and $110 million in 2021). Over the same period, the total (charge)/credit to other comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil is $4,418 million (sum of -$1,364 million in 2019, $956 million in 2020, and $3,826 million in 2021). This shows that while the investment in equity companies had a relatively small net impact over the three years, the broader comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil showed significant fluctuation and a much larger cumulative positive impact in the later years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The (charge)/credit to investment in equity companies for 2019 (-$19 million), 2020 (-$110 million), and 2021 ($110 million) are taken from the table.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The (charge)/credit to other comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil for 2019 (-$1,364 million), 2020 ($956 million), and 2021 ($3,826 million) are also taken from the same table.",
        "Step 3: Calculate cumulative totals - Sum the values for both metrics across the three-year period to compare their overall financial impacts.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The comparison highlights the relative contribution of investment in equity companies versus broader comprehensive income to ExxonMobil's financial position."

      "question": "What was the change in Chevron's valuation adjustments for unproved properties between 2021 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's exploration asset impairments over this period?",
      "answer": "Chevron's valuation adjustments for unproved properties decreased from $2,921 million in 2021 to $2,103 million in 2023, representing a reduction of $818 million. This indicates a decline in the company's impairments related to unproved properties over the two-year period, suggesting either improved prospects for these properties or a more conservative approach to valuation adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the 2021 valuation adjustment for unproved properties: $2,921 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract the 2023 valuation adjustment for unproved properties: $2,103 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the change between the two years: $2,921 million (2021) - $2,103 million (2023) = $818 million decrease.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the change in context: A decrease in valuation adjustments indicates reduced impairment write-downs, which could signal improved asset quality or more selective impairment recognition."

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's extensions and discoveries added 743 BCF of natural gas and 225 MMBbl of liquids to total consolidated reserves. In 2022, extensions and discoveries added 1,637 BCF of natural gas and 302 MMBbl of liquids. The combined 2023 impact (743 BCF + 225 MMBbl = 968 total barrels of oil equivalent) was significantly lower than the 2022 impact (1,637 BCF + 302 MMBbl = 1,939 total barrels of oil equivalent), showing a decrease of 971 total barrels of oil equivalent.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' proved bitumen reserves experienced both upward and downward revisions over the three years. In 2021, there were downward revisions of 64 million barrels due to carbon tax costs and 39 million barrels due to development timing changes at Surmont, partially offset by upward revisions of 53 million barrels from price changes. In 2022, there were downward revisions of 30 million barrels due to variable royalties on price, partially offset by upward revisions from development timing changes at Surmont. In 2023, there was an upward revision of 15 million barrels due to the impact of price on variable royalties. Additionally, in 2023, the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont contributed to reserves through purchases. This acquisition directly increased reserves by adding ownership of additional resources previously held through an affiliate, where no bitumen reserves were attributed to equity affiliates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2021, downward revisions were 64 million barrels (carbon tax) and 39 million barrels (Surmont development timing), partially offset by 53 million barrels from price.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2022, downward revisions were 30 million barrels (royalties on price), partially offset by Surmont development timing changes; in 2023, upward revision of 15 million barrels due to price impact on royalties.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2023, the Surmont acquisition added reserves through purchases, and there are no bitumen reserves associated with equity affiliates, indicating the acquisition brought previously non-consolidated reserves into the company's books.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The net change in proved bitumen reserves reflects a complex pattern of revisions over three years, with Surmont-related development timing and acquisition playing key roles in both upward and downward adjustments."

Over the same period, COP's undeveloped bitumen reserves increased by 28 million barrels (from 89 million barrels at the end of 2022 to 117 million barrels at the end of 2023).

      "answer": "The net change in proved bitumen reserves over the three years ended December 31, 2023, was a decrease of 54 million barrels. In 2021, there were downward revisions of 64 million barrels due to carbon tax costs and 39 million barrels due to development timing, partially offset by upward revisions of 53 million barrels from price changes. In 2022, there was a net downward revision of 30 million barrels due to variable royalties. In 2023, there was an upward revision of 15 million barrels due to price impacts. Combining these: -64 -39 +53 -30 +15 = -75 million barrels cumulative revisions. However, in 2023, ConocoPhillips acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont, which contributed additional reserves through purchases, offsetting the decline to a net change of -54 million barrels.",

      "answer": "The average bitumen price per barrel in COP's consolidated operations in Canada increased from $42.15 in 2023 to $47.92 in 2024, representing a $5.77 increase. During the same period, the average crude oil price in Canada increased from $66.19 in 2023 to $64.47 in 2024, representing a $1.72 decrease. Therefore, while bitumen prices rose significantly, crude oil prices slightly declined in Canada.",

      "answer": "The impact of intersegment eliminations on Chevron's consolidated sales and other operating revenues in 2022 was a reduction of $2,490 million. This adjustment was necessary to avoid double-counting revenues from transactions between Chevron's geographic business segments, such as between L48 and Canada, which totaled $2,445 million alone. The eliminations ensure that the consolidated revenue of $78,494 million reflects only external revenues generated from third-party customers.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Unit-of-Production Depreciation\n\nOil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using a ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves while capitalized drilling and developments costs are depreciated using a ratio of actual production volumes to proved developed reserves. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability.\n\nIn the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.\n\nTo the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the ex pected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.\n\n## Fair Value Used in Business Combinations\n\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. If applicable, any ex cess of the purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant group.\n\nOn May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. To effect the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of Ex x onMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.\n\nIn respect of the Pioneer acquisition, the most significant amount of judgment involved the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment related to crude oil and natural gas properties, for which we used discounted cash flow models. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices consistent with the average of third-party industry experts, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.\n\nSee Note 21 for further information regarding the Pioneer acquisition during 2024.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle.\n\nBecause the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, development costs, and production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation's view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses.

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's total depreciation and depletion expense increased from $15,276 million in 2023 for consolidated subsidiaries and $732 million for equity companies (totaling $16,008 million) to $23.4 billion in 2024. This represents an increase of $7.4 billion. In terms of the company's total adjusted operating costs, the percentage of depreciation and depletion rose from 21.1% in 2023 ($16.008 billion / $75.8 billion) to 28.0% in 2024 ($23.4 billion / $83.6 billion).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 2024 depreciation and depletion expense is $23.4 billion, as reported in the structural cost savings table under the components of operating costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - For 2023, the depreciation and depletion expense for consolidated subsidiaries is $15,276 million and for equity companies is $732 million, totaling $16,008 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the change in depreciation and depletion expense from 2023 to 2024: $23,400 million - $16,008 million = $7,392 million increase.",
        "Step 4: Extract total adjusted operating costs from evidence_source_a and evidence_source_b - The 2024 total adjusted operating costs are $83.6 billion, and the 2023 total adjusted operating costs are estimated at $75.8 billion (based on subtotal of operating costs plus equity company expenses).",
        "Step 5: Calculate the percentage of depreciation and depletion relative to total adjusted operating costs for both years: 2023 = $16.008 billion / $75.8 billion = 21.1%, and 2024 = $23.4 billion / $83.6 billion = 28.0%.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - The total depreciation and depletion expense increased significantly year-over-year and represented a larger share of the company's total adjusted operating costs in 2024 compared to 2023."
