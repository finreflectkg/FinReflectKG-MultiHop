      "answer": "The total business interruption income recorded by SPG in 2021 from hurricane-related events was $2.1 million. These events also led to gains from property insurance recoveries totaling $21.0 million in 2021, as the insurance proceeds from Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Laura exceeded the book value of the damaged assets.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, SPG recorded $2.1 million in business interruption income during the year ended December 31, 2021, related to hurricane events.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, SPG recorded a $3.5 million gain related to Hurricane Hanna and a $17.5 million gain related to Hurricane Laura in 2021 from property insurance recoveries.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, the business interruption income and insurance recovery gains are both tied to the same hurricane events (Hanna and Laura), showing a direct financial impact chain: hurricane damage \u2192 business interruption income \u2192 insurance proceeds \u2192 gain on recovery.",
        "Step 4: The total business interruption income ($2.1 million) and total insurance recovery gains ($3.5M + $17.5M = $21.0 million) are synthesized to show the dual financial effects of the hurricanes in 2021."

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $2.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nDuring the third  quarter  of  2020,  one  of  our  properties  located  in Texas  experienced  property  damage  and business  interruption  as  a  result  of  Hurricane  Hanna.    We  wrote-off  assets  of  approximately  $9.6  million,  and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $14.0 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.    The  proceeds  were  used  for  property  restoration  and  remediation  and  reduced  the  insurance  recovery receivable.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a $3.5 million gain related to property insurance recovery  of  previously  depreciated  assets.    This  amount  was  recorded  in  gain  (loss)  on  acquisition  of  controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, one of our properties located in Louisiana experienced property damage and business  interruption  as  a  result  of  Hurricane  Laura.      We  wrote-off  assets  of  approximately  $11.1  million  and recorded an insurance recovery receivable, and have received $27.5 million of insurance proceeds from third-party carriers.    The  proceeds  were  used  for  property  restoration  and  remediation  and  reduced  the  insurance  recovery receivable.    During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  recorded  a  $17.5  million  gain  related  to  property insurance  recovery  of  previously  depreciated  assets.    This  amount  was  recorded  in  gain  (loss)  on  acquisition  of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net.\n\n## Acquisitions and Dispositions\n\nBuy-sell,  marketing  rights,  and  other  exit  mechanisms  are  common  in  real  estate  partnership  agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners  in  our  joint  venture  properties  may  initiate  these  provisions  (subject  to  any  applicable  lock  up  or  similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have  adequate  liquidity  to  execute  the  purchase  without  hindering  our  cash  flows,  then  we  may  initiate  these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the  net  proceeds  to  reduce  outstanding  indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.\n\nAcquisitions. The  Company sponsored,  through  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  a  special  purpose  acquisition corporation,  or  SPAC,  named  Simon  Property  Group Acquisition  Holdings,  Inc.  On  February  18,  2021  the  SPAC announced the pricing of its initial public offering, which was consummated on February 23, 2021, generating gross proceeds  of  $345.0  million.    The  SPAC  is  a  consolidated  VIE  which  was  formed  for  the  purpose  of  effecting  a business  combination  and  is  targeting  innovative  businesses  that  operate  within  Simon's  'Live,  Work,  Play,  Stay, Shop' ecosystem.\n\nOn  July  1,  2021,  we  contributed  to  ABG  all  of  our  interests  in  both  the  Forever  21  and  Brooks  Brothers licensing ventures in exchange for additional interests in ABG.  As a result, in the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a  non-cash gain of $159.8 million representing the difference between fair value of the interests received and the carrying value of our interests in the licensing ventures, less costs to sell.  On December 20, 2021, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $18.8 million.  In connection with this transaction, we recorded taxes of $8.0 million.  Subsequently we acquired additional interests in ABG for tax consideration of $100.0 million.  At December 31, 2021, our noncontrolling interest in ABG was approximately 10.4%.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we and our partner, ABG, each acquired additional 12.5% interests in the licensing and operations of Forever 21, our share of which was $56.3 million, bringing our interest to 50%. Subsequently the Forever 21 operations were merged into SPARC Group.\n\nIn  January  2020,  we  acquired  additional  interests  of  5.05%  and  1.37%  in  SPARC  Group  and  ABG, respectively, for $6.7 million and $33.5 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, SPARC acquired certain assets  and  operations  of  Brooks  Brothers  and  Lucky  Brands  out  of  bankruptcy.  At  September  30,  2020,  our noncontrolling equity method interests in the operations venture of SPARC Group and in ABG were 50.0% and 6.8%, respectively.",

Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts\n\nand where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\nWe currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on  an  'all  risk'  basis  in  the  amount  of  up  to  $1  billion.  Despite  the  existence  of  this  insurance  coverage,  any threatened  or  actual  terrorist  attacks  where  we  operate  could  adversely  affect  our  property  values,  revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.\n\n## Hurricane Impacts\n\nDuring  the  third  quarter  of  2017,  two  of  our  wholly-owned  properties  located  in  Puerto  Rico  sustained significant property damage and business interruption as a result of Hurricane Maria.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $209.9 million and $219.2 million, respectively. Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which have estimated fair values in excess of the guaranteed amount.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nOur  U.S.  Malls,  Premium  Outlets,  and  The  Mills  rely  upon  anchor  tenants  to  attract  customers;  however, anchors do not contribute materially to our financial results as many anchors own their spaces. All material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant accounts for 5% or more of our consolidated revenues.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines are being administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and  other  authorities,  including  where  we  own  or  hold  interests  in  properties,  have  at  times  imposed  measures intended to control its spread,",

This total RSU value is significantly higher than the total compensation expense recorded for LTIP programs in 2021, which was $13.4 million.

This reduction suggests that SPG is collecting previously recognized straightline rent receivables, which could improve cash flow in the near term. Additionally, the filing notes that amounts deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be collected primarily in 2022 and 2023.

      "answer": "The total cumulative impact of Disposals and Deconsolidations from 2019 to 2021 is $1,195,078 (in thousands). This is calculated by summing the values for Disposals and Deconsolidations: $219,268 (2019) + $320,328 (2020) + $655,482 (2021). In 2021 specifically, the beginning balance was $37,608,638 and the closing balance was $37,497,216. The difference of $111,422 (in thousands) is explained by the net effect of disposals ($655,482), acquisitions ($121,250), improvements ($569,483), and currency translation adjustment ($-146,673).

      "answer": "The process of reviewing investment properties for impairment, which includes evaluating forecasted cash flows and adjusting depreciation methods based on economic conditions, directly affects the evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities like Kl\u00e9pierre and TRG. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of these investments totaled $8.0 billion. The impairment review for both investment properties and unconsolidated entities involves assessing forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization. If the forecasted cash flows indicate a decline in value, it may trigger an impairment analysis for these unconsolidated entities. Additionally, the depreciation method for investment properties is adjusted based on economic life changes, which can influence the assumptions used in forecasting cash flows for unconsolidated entities. This creates a causal relationship where the impairment evaluation methodology for investment properties informs the impairment testing for unconsolidated entities, especially given the sensitivity of both to assumptions like capitalization rates and market multiples.",

We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation  and  amortization  to  historical  actual  results  and  evaluated  significant  variances, including  consideration  of  the  current  economic  environment.  As  part  of  our  evaluation,  we assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  carrying  value  of  the  Company's  investments  in  unconsolidated entities and its investments in Kl\u00e9pierre and TRG totaled $8.0 billion. As explained in Note 3 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  reviews  investments  in  unconsolidated entities for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an  investment  in  an  unconsolidated  entity  may  not  be  recoverable.  To  identify  and  evaluate whether  an  other-than-temporary  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  an  investment  below  its  carrying value has occurred, the Company assesses economic and operating conditions that may affect the fair value of the investment. The evaluation of operating conditions may include developing estimates of forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization to support the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment. When required, the Company estimates the fair value of an investment and assesses whether any impairment is other than temporary  using  observable  and  unobservable  inputs  such  as  historical  and  forecasted  cash flows  or  operating  income  before  depreciation  and  amortization,  estimated  capitalization  and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information.\n\nAuditing management's evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, estimated fair value of the investment and whether any decline in fair value below the related investment's carrying amount is other-than-temporary. In  particular,  the  impairment  evaluation  for  these  investments  was  sensitive  to  significant assumptions  such  as  forecasted  cash  flows, operating income  before  depreciation  and amortization, relevant market multiples, and capitalization and discount rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls  over  the  Company's  process  for  evaluating  investments  in  unconsolidated  entities  for impairment,  including  controls  over  management's  review  of  the  significant  assumptions described above.\n\nTo test the Company's evaluation of investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating  the  significant  assumptions  discussed  above  and  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy of data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation  and  amortization  to  historical  actual  results  and  evaluated  significant  variances, including  consideration  of  the  current  economic  environment.

We compared significant assumptions used to external market data to assess whether the assumptions were market supported. We involved our  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in  the  assessment  of  the  methodology  utilized  by  the Partnership  and  to  test  certain  of  the  assumptions  including  capitalization  rates  and  the valuation  of  land.  We  also  compared  the  forecasted  cash  flows  and  operating  income  before depreciation  and  amortization  used  in  the  valuations  to  historical  actual  results  and  marketsupported data, evaluated significant variances, including consideration of the current economic environment, and performed certain sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact on the purchase accounting allocations.  We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data included in the valuation models.\n\n## Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Partnership's consolidated net investment properties totaled $22.3 billion.  In  addition,  a  significant  number  of  the  Partnership's  investments  in  unconsolidated entities and its investments in Kl\u00e9pierre and TRG hold investment properties. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership reviews investment properties for  impairment  on  a  property-by-property  basis  to  identify  and  evaluate  events  or  changes  in circumstances  that indicate the carrying value of an investment property  may  not  be recoverable.  The  Partnership  estimates  undiscounted  cash  flows  of  an  investment  property using  observable  and  unobservable  inputs  such  as  historical  and  forecasted  cash  flows, operating  income  before  depreciation  and  amortization,  estimated  capitalization  rates,  leasing prospects and local market information.\n\nAuditing management's evaluation of investment properties for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the undiscounted cash flows of an investment property. In  particular,  the  impairment  evaluation  for  investment  properties  was  sensitive  to  significant assumptions  such  as  forecasted  cash  flows  and  operating  income  before  depreciation  and amortization, and capitalization rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls  over  the  Partnership's  process  for  evaluating  investment  properties  for  impairment, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.\n\nTo test the Partnership's evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant  assumptions  discussed  above  and  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the underlying data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources.

      "question": "How does the capitalization of interest during construction of investment properties impact the depreciation expense recognized over the useful life of the assets, based on the accounting policies disclosed by SPG in 2022?",
      "answer": "The capitalization of interest during construction increases the initial cost basis of investment properties, which in turn increases the depreciation expense recognized over the useful life of the assets. SPG capitalizes interest on projects during construction periods based on interest rates in place during those periods, and this capitalized interest becomes part of the asset's cost. Since SPG depreciates buildings and improvements using the straight-line method over 10 to 35 years, a higher asset cost due to capitalized interest results in higher annual depreciation expenses over the asset's life.",

Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for USD LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the United States.  At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the LIBOR benchmark is anticipated in coming years.  Accordingly, the outcome of these reforms is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR's phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.  The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, and there can be no assurance that they will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark interest rates,  substantially  higher  financing  costs  or  a  shortage  of  available  debt  financing,  any  of  which  could  have  an adverse effect on us, which currently would be limited by our relatively low exposure to variable rate LIBOR-based debt.\n\n## Risks Relating to Income Taxes\n\nSimon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs in the United  States.  The  failure  to  maintain  Simon's  or  the  Subsidiary  REITs'  qualifications  as  REITs  or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences.\n\nIn the United States, Simon and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that Simon and these subsidiaries, or  the  Subsidiary  REITs,  have  been  organized  and  have  operated  in  a  manner  which  allows  them  to  qualify  for taxation  as  REITs  under  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  We  intend  to  continue  to  operate  in  this  manner.  However, qualification  and  taxation  as  REITs  depend  upon  the  ability  of  Simon  and  the  Subsidiary  REITs  to  satisfy  several requirements (some of which are outside our control), including tests related to our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. The various REIT qualification tests required by the Internal Revenue Code are highly technical and complex. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.\n\nIf  Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs fail to comply with those provisions, Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as REITs. If such events occur, and if available relief provisions do not apply:\n\n- Simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income;\n- Simon  or  any  such  subsidiary  will  be  subject  to  corporate-level  income  tax  on  taxable  income  at  the corporate rate;\n- Simon or any such Subsidiary REIT could be subject to the federal alternative  minimum  tax  for  taxable years prior to 2018; and\n- unless  entitled  to  relief  under  relevant  statutory  provisions,  Simon  or  any  such  subsidiary  will  also  be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.\n\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. In addition, if Simon fails to qualify as a REIT, it will not be  required  to  make  distributions  to  our  stockholders.  Moreover,  a  failure  by  any  subsidiary  of  the  Operating Partnership that has elected to be taxed as a REIT to qualify as a REIT would also cause Simon to fail to qualify as a REIT, and the same adverse consequences would apply to it and its stockholders. Failure by Simon or any of the Subsidiary REITs to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, which could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nAdditionally,  we  are  subject  to  certain  income-based  taxes,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  and  other taxes,  including  state  and  local  taxes,  franchise  taxes,  and  withholding  taxes  on  dividends  from  certain  of  our international",

      "question": "Given the consistent weighted-average discount rate for operating leases at 4.87% in 2019 and 2021, and the decrease in the weighted-average remaining lease term from 35.6 years in 2019 to 33.6 years in 2021, how might the change in lease term have impacted Simon Property Group's operating cash flows from operating leases between those years, considering the cash flows increased from $48,519 in 2019 to $47,824 in 2021?",
      "answer": "The slight decrease in the weighted-average remaining lease term from 35.6 years in 2019 to 33.6 years in 2021 indicates that the duration of Simon Property Group's operating leases shortened over this period. Despite this reduction in lease term, the company's operating cash flows from operating leases decreased only slightly from $48,519 in 2019 to $47,824 in 2021. This suggests that the cash flows were relatively stable even with shorter lease durations, potentially indicating consistent leasing activity or tenant retention despite the reduction in lease term. The weighted-average discount rate remained nearly constant (4.87% in both 2019 and 2021), meaning the present value of future lease payments was not significantly affected by interest rate assumptions, further supporting the observed stability in cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The weighted-average remaining lease term decreased from 35.6 years in 2019 to 33.6 years in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The operating cash flows from operating leases were $48,519 in 2019 and $47,824 in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The decrease in lease term did not result in a significant drop in cash flows, suggesting stable leasing performance despite shorter lease durations."

This decrease is directly tied to SPG\u2019s depreciation policies, which apply the straight-line method to buildings and improvements over 10 to 35 years.

      "answer": "The excess investment is amortized over the life of the related depreciable components of assets acquired, typically no greater than 40 years, which overlaps with the estimated useful life of buildings and improvements that range from 10 to 35 years. This means that the amortization of excess investment could extend beyond the typical depreciation period of buildings and improvements, potentially affecting long-term financial reporting by spreading the cost over a longer timeframe.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Excess investment is amortized over the life of the related depreciable components of assets acquired, typically no greater than 40 years.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  These  judgments  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting  in  a  different  presentation  of  our  financial  statements.  From  time  to  time,  we  reevaluate  our estimates  and  assumptions.  In  the  event  estimates  or  assumptions  prove  to  be  different  from  actual  results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant's financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines in such conditions due to, or amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic.  When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including, among other things, the timing of a tenant's bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the Company's properties on substantially similar terms.  In the  event  that  we  determine  accrued  receivables  are  not  probable  of  collection,  lease  income  will  be recorded  on  a  cash  basis,  with  the  corresponding  tenant  receivable  and  straight-line  rent  receivable charged  as  a  direct  write-off  against  lease  income  in  the  period  of  the  change  in  our  collectability determination.\n- We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property's operational performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company's intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements.  We  measure  any  impairment  of  investment  property  when  the  estimated  undiscounted operating  income  before  depreciation  and  amortization  during  the  anticipated  holding  period  plus  its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  our  investments  may  not  be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less than  their  carrying  value  and  such  impairment  is  other-than-temporary.  Our  evaluation  of  changes  in economic  or  operating  conditions  and  whether  an  impairment  is  other-than-temporary  may  include developing  estimates  of  fair  value,  forecasted  cash  flows  or  operating  income  before  depreciation  and amortization. We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such  as  operating  income,  hold  periods,  estimated  capitalization  and  discount  rates,  or  relevant  market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments are other-thantemporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review",

This decrease contributed to the change in operating loss, which increased from $100.6 million in 2023 to $969.5 million in 2024, an increase of $868.9 million. The income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2024 was $3,624.8 million. As a result, the $62.0 million reduction in depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses had a 1.71% impact on the income from continuing operations before income taxes ($62.0M / $3,624.8M = 1.71%).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 20.    BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "answer": "The $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit in 2023 was recorded in the Loss from discontinued operations, negatively impacting the financial results of that year. However, in 2024, the change in the estimated useful life of tower assets from 20 to 30 years led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense ($649 million after tax), which positively affected the 2024 financial performance. Therefore, while the prior year's impairment charge continued to reflect poor performance in discontinued operations, the asset life extension significantly improved the current year's operating results by reducing depreciation costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit was $322.0 million and was recorded in Loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The impairment charge in 2023 directly impacted the Loss from discontinued operations, signaling poor performance of the India segment. In 2024, the change in asset life reduced depreciation costs, improving financial performance. Together, these two events reflect a contrast between the negative impact of past decisions (India impairment) and the positive effect of revised accounting estimates (longer asset lives)."

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis included current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

      "answer": "The increase in the weighted average cost of capital caused the fair value of the Spain reporting unit to decline, leading to a $80.0 million goodwill impairment charge in 2023. In 2024, American Tower Corporation extended the estimated useful life of its tower assets from 20 to 30 years, which resulted in a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense ($649 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024.

The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease.

The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit.

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business, inclusive of our data center business discussed below, as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we provide for the leasing of space primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our communications real estate portfolio of 148,957 communications sites included 42,222 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 26,642 communications sites in Africa &amp; APAC (as defined below), 31,786 communications sites in Europe and 48,307 communications sites in Latin America, as well as (i) urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa and Spain, (ii) other property interests in Canada and the United States and (iii) 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, we undertook a strategic review of our India operations, where we evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within our global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, we, through our subsidiaries, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. and ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ('ATC TIPL'), which held our operations in India, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes'), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of our existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to us, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by us at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, we completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). We used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under our $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended (the '2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility'). The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. We recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of our cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. See note 22 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report ('Note 22') for further discussion.\n\n## PART I",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and ex penses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates' below.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed the sale of ATC TIPL. The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. See Note 22 for further discussion. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL's operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Historical financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the operating results of ATC TIPL as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we also completed the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our APAC property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now report our results in six  segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Historical financial information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 and includes our U.S. &amp; Canada property, Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment.\n\nWe also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.",

As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis included current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. The goodwill impairment charge is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following:\n\n",

      "answer": "The $80.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit in 2023 did not directly affect the 2024 consolidated financial statements as it was already recorded in 2023; however, it contributed to a lower carrying value of the Spain reporting unit going into 2024, which could have influenced the valuation assumptions in subsequent impairment reviews. Meanwhile, the $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2024, resulting from the extension of tower asset useful lives to 30 years, positively impacted operating income and net income for 2024. This large decrease in depreciation expense overshadowed any ongoing operational effects from the prior year's impairment, thereby improving the company's financial performance metrics for 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, resulting from the change in estimated useful lives of tower assets from 20 to 30 years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The $80.0 million goodwill impairment charge recorded for the Spain reporting unit in the year ended December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 2023 impairment affected the carrying value of the Spain reporting unit but did not directly impact 2024 results. However, the significant $730 million reduction in depreciation expense in 2024 had a direct positive effect on the company's 2024 financial performance, potentially offsetting or masking any lingering negative effects from the prior year's impairment."

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

The contingent indemnification liability is recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the loss incurred on the sale of ATC TIPL which can only be utilized against future nonresident long-term India capital gains earned by ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from this will not be realized and has recorded a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax  asset of approx imately $140 million.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, ATC TIPL represented approximately 23%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's international property revenue, international gross margin and international operating profit and 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of the Company's total property revenue, total segment gross margin and total segment operating profit. Prior to the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction, ATC TIPL represented approximately 42% of the Company's international communications sites and 34% of the Company's total communications sites. The Company believes that the sale of ATC TIPL represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on its operations and financial results, and as such, the divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL's operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Accordingly, the operating results of ATC TIPL are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.",

The Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the existing property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada. Prior to this revision, the Company operated in five property business segments: (i) U.S. &amp; Canada property, (ii) Asia-Pacific property (iii) Africa property, (iii) Europe property and (iv) Latin America property.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Asia-Pacific: property operations in Australia, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines;\n- Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSummarized financial information concerning the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following tables. The 'Other' column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.",

In 2019, the total 'Other expense' was $938.3 million, while in 2022 it was $1,332.2 million. This represents an increase of $393.9 million in total 'Other expense,' which may be partially attributed to the rise in SG&A expenses.

      "answer": "Following the Telxius and CoreSite Acquisitions, AMT's Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant was temporarily increased to 7.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters after each acquisition, allowing AMT to maintain higher leverage while financing these acquisitions. This adjustment enabled AMT to borrow $7.8 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and $4.9 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility during 2021, using the increased flexibility to fund the acquisitions and refinance existing debt. Without this covenant relief, AMT would have been restricted from borrowing at these levels due to tighter leverage limits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is adjusted to not exceed 7.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters following each Qualified Acquisition (Telxius and CoreSite).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - AMT borrowed $7.8 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and $4.9 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility during 2021, primarily to fund the Telxius and CoreSite Acquisitions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The covenant relief allowing a 7.50 to 1.00 ratio was essential for AMT to support the large borrowings needed to complete the acquisitions, as tighter leverage limits (e.g., 6.00 to 1.00) would have restricted access to capital."

The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.\n\nFailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\n\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust SecuritizationsThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the 'Series 2015-2 Notes') issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ('GTP Acquisition Partners') in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the 'AMT Asset Subs') are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).\n\nUnder the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the 'Series 2013-2A Securities'), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the 'Series 2018-1A Securities'), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the 'Series 2018-1R Securities' and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the '2018 Securities') issued in the Trust Securitizations (the 'Loan'), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates' below.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\nIn evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and includes our U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment.\n\nWe also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.",

      "answer": "The total amount of debt outstanding under the 2021 Term Loan after the December 28, 2021 borrowing is $1.0 billion. The borrowing of $500.0 million on December 28, 2021, which brought the total outstanding under the 2021 Term Loan to $1.0 billion, contributed to an increase in the Company's Total Debt. This borrowing was used to fund the CoreSite Acquisition, which triggered a temporary increase in the permitted Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio from 6.00 to 1.00 to a higher threshold of 7.50 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters following the acquisition. This adjustment allowed the company to maintain compliance with its loan covenants despite the increased debt load.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 2021 Term Loan had $1.0 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2021, after a $500.0 million borrowing on December 28, 2021, used to fund the CoreSite Acquisition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The permitted Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was amended to 7.50 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters following the CoreSite Acquisition, which began with the quarter ended December 31, 2021, stepping down to 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $500.0 million borrowing under the 2021 Term Loan on December 28, 2021, increased total debt to $1.0 billion, contributing to a higher Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. This required a temporary increase in the covenant ratio from 6.00 to 1.00 to 7.50 to 1.00 to accommodate the debt increase from the CoreSite Acquisition."

      "answer": "The total decrease in liability related to foreign currency translation for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $62.0 million and $42.1 million, respectively, summing to a combined decrease of $104.1 million. This liability reduction is a result of revisions in estimates and is distinct from, but contextually related to, the $4.2 billion estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021. These figures indicate how changes in foreign exchange rates can impact liability estimates and highlight the scale of future obligations relative to these adjustments.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The liability decrease due to foreign currency translation was $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The liability decrease due to foreign currency translation was $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the total decrease - $62.0 million + $42.1 million = $104.1 million total decrease over the two years.",
        "Step 4: Extract the future cash outlay - The estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021, was $4.2 billion.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The total liability decrease of $104.1 million is a result of foreign currency translation effects, which are part of the broader context of how AMT accounts for asset retirement obligations, a liability category totaling $4.2 billion."
