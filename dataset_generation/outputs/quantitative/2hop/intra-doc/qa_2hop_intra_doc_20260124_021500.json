      "answer": "Eli Lilly retired $12,427.5 million in 2019, $500.0 million in 2020, and $1,250.0 million in 2021. The total retirement amount across these years was $14,177.5 million. This led to a cumulative reduction in the company's equity in treasury shares, which stood at $52.7 million by the end of 2021.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - In 2019, the retirement of treasury shares amounted to $12,427.5 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - In 2020, the retirement of treasury shares was $500.0 million and in 2021 it was $1,250.0 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate total retirement value - $12,427.5 million (2019) + $500.0 million (2020) + $1,250.0 million (2021) = $14,177.5 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The cumulative retirement of treasury shares significantly reduced the company's equity in treasury shares, which decreased from $60.8 million at the end of 2019 to $52.7 million at the end of 2021."

As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

Compare this to the 2023 projected payment from evidence_source_b ($89.5 million) to determine the relationship between asset value and expected liability payout."

      "answer": "The uncertainty surrounding payer reimbursement, as noted in both evidence chunks, combined with the high cost of drug development exceeding $2 billion per drug, significantly hampers LLY's ability to ensure a continuous flow of commercially successful new products and maintain financial stability. Since most funds invested in research programs do not generate financial returns and new products may fail to reach the market or achieve commercial success due to inability to secure or maintain payer reimbursement, LLY faces substantial risk in offsetting development costs and replacing revenues lost from products losing intellectual property protection. This dual challenge threatens LLY\u2019s long-term financial position and operational success.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion.' This highlights the high cost and long timeline of drug development.",

This emphasizes the risk of failure due to reimbursement uncertainty.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of high development costs and the risk of failure due to lack of payer reimbursement creates a significant financial burden and uncertainty in generating returns, directly affecting LLY's ability to sustain a pipeline of commercially successful products and maintain financial stability."

As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

      "answer": "The total value of alternative investments held by the retiree health benefit plans and defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2021, was $7,515.4 million, calculated as 38% of $19,777.4 million in total plan assets. These investments include hedge funds and private equity-like funds, which are valued using significant unobservable inputs or based on net asset value (NAV) reported by counterparties, adjusted as necessary. The valuation of these alternative investments poses higher estimation uncertainty because they involve complex inputs such as discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity, and other risks. Additionally, some of the valuation data comes from unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.",

At December 31, 2021 the Company had $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and inperson or telephonic meetings with investment firms to discuss valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values and reconciling any differences. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\n\n/s/    Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 23, 2022",

      "question": "What is the total fair value of alternative investments in both the Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Health Benefit Plans combined, and how does the use of unobservable inputs in valuing these investments contribute to estimation uncertainty in the audit process?",
      "answer": "The total fair value of alternative investments in both the Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Health Benefit Plans is $5,791.0 million. This includes $2,661.3 million in hedge funds and $2,844.7 million in equity-like funds from the Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and $229.7 million in hedge funds and $223.4 million in equity-like funds from the Retiree Health Benefit Plans. The use of unobservable inputs or valuations based on net asset value (NAV) reported by counterparties introduces estimation uncertainty because these valuations rely on unaudited information, discounted cash flow models, and adjustments for risks such as liquidity and credit. Auditors must perform additional procedures, such as comparing fund returns to benchmarks and confirming fair values directly with trustees, to mitigate the risk of material misstatement.",

          "chunk_text": "## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include:\n\n- working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;\n- capital expenditures;\n- share repurchases and dividends;\n- repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;\n- milestone and royalty payments; and\n- potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.\n\nOur management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

At December 31, 2021 the Company had $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and inperson or telephonic meetings with investment firms to discuss valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values and reconciling any differences. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\n\n/s/    Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 23, 2022",

      "answer": "The total value of plan assets related to both defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans at the end of 2021 was $19,777.4 million. The retiree health benefit plan obligations from 2022 through 2031 totaled $477.7 million in the final period, while the defined benefit pension plan obligations in the same final period were $3,919.7 million.

At December 31, 2021 the Company had $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and inperson or telephonic meetings with investment firms to discuss valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values and reconciling any differences. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\n\n/s/    Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 23, 2022",

      "answer": "The combined percentage decrease in Humalog revenue was 12% (11% in the U.S. + 1% outside the U.S.). The U.S. decline was primarily driven by lower realized prices due to higher contracted rebates and discounts and increased utilization in more highly-rebated government segments, partially offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment.

      "question": "How much is the total expected contribution for retiree health benefit plans over the period 2024 to 2033, and how does this financial obligation relate to the company's overall liquidity strategy as described in the context of its capital requirements?",
      "answer": "The total expected contribution for retiree health benefit plans over the period from 2024 to 2033 is $949.5 million. This financial obligation is part of the company's broader capital requirements, which include commitments to defined benefit pension plans, capital expenditures, dividends, repayment of borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, and business development activities. Despite a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities to $4.24 billion in 2023, the company believes its available cash, cash equivalents, and operating cash flow are sufficient to fund these obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract the expected contributions for retiree health benefit plans from evidence_source_b - The sum of $93.8 million (2024) + $94.5 million (2025) + $94.7 million (2026) + $95.2 million (2027) + $95.6 million (2028) + $475.9 million (2029-2033) equals $949.5 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract the company's liquidity and capital resources context from evidence_source_a - The company states that its available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow, and access to short-term and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund capital requirements, including contributions to retiree health benefit plans.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $949.5 million obligation for retiree health benefit plans is a component of the company's broader capital requirements, which also include other significant commitments. Despite a drop in operating cash flow in 2023, the company remains confident in its ability to meet these obligations."

At December 31, 2023, the Company had $16,289.0 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 48 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued primarily at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Auditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, particularly the underlying determination of net asset values (\"NAVs\"). Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring investment firms' valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, and obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the custodian and a sample of fund managers at year end.                                                                                                     |\n| /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| We have served as the                    | Company's auditor since 1940.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Indianapolis, Indiana                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| February 21, 2024                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |",

      "answer": "The total fair value of Retiree Health Benefit Plans' investments in public equity securities (U.S. and International) and fixed income in developed markets is $291.8 million ($127.0 million U.S. + $89.9 million International + $74.9 million fixed income). This allocation contributes to the underfunded status of the plans, as disclosed by LLY, where the accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets, indicating that the current investments may not be sufficient to meet future retiree health benefit liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Identify the fair value of public equity securities (U.S. and International) and fixed income in developed markets under Retiree Health Benefit Plans: $127.0 million (U.S.), $89.9 million (International), and $74.9 million (Developed markets fixed income).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LLY discloses that the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The sum of the identified investments ($291.8 million) is a key component of the total plan assets. Given that the accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets, this indicates that the current level of investment, including these allocations, is insufficient to cover future liabilities, contributing to the underfunded status."

      "answer": "The total expected cost for LLY's Retiree Health Benefit Plans from 2029 to 2033 is $475.9 million. This amount represents a relatively stable trend compared to the preceding five years (2024\u20132028), where annual costs only increased slightly from $93.8 million to $95.6 million, a difference of $1.8 million over five years. This suggests that the retiree health benefit costs are projected to remain consistent in the long term.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document confirms that the measurement date for retiree health benefit plans is December 31, and that the funded status and obligations are reported annually in the consolidated balance sheets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The expected costs for the Retiree Health Benefit Plans for the years 2024 through 2028 are $93.8M, $94.5M, $94.7M, $95.2M, and $95.6M respectively, showing a minimal increase over five years.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b (continued) - The cumulative expected cost for the Retiree Health Benefit Plans for the period 2029\u20132033 is $475.9 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - By comparing the cumulative amount for 2029\u20132033 with the trend observed from 2024\u20132028, we can infer that the company expects a consistent level of retiree health benefit costs without significant growth in the near future."

      "answer": "LLY's commercial success for its diabetes product portfolio, including Trajenta, Jardiance, and others developed in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, depends heavily on payer reimbursement rates and coverage. If payers do not provide adequate reimbursement or coverage, the market adoption of these products could be significantly hindered. This risk is compounded by the fact that payer coverage and reimbursement rates are cited as key competitive factors in LLY's 10-K filing, directly influencing product acceptance and success. Furthermore, the filing explicitly notes that failure to obtain or maintain necessary payer reimbursement or coverage can lead to limited commercial success, even for products that appear promising in development. Thus, uncertainties in payer reimbursement directly threaten the commercial viability of LLY's diabetes portfolio, despite its collaborative development with Boehringer Ingelheim.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - LLY collaborates with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products including Trajenta, Jardiance, and others.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Payer reimbursement and coverage are explicitly cited as critical factors that can prevent or hinder the commercial success of products, even if they are promising in development.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The dependency of LLY on payer reimbursement (connector entity) directly impacts the commercial success of the diabetes portfolio developed with Boehringer Ingelheim. If payers do not reimburse adequately, the products may not achieve sufficient market adoption, despite their development partnerships and clinical promise."

      "answer": "The total unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for both Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Health Benefit Plans in 2023 is $1,817.2 million. This is calculated by subtracting the fair value of plan assets ($564.3 million) from the accumulated benefit obligation for Defined Benefit Pension Plans ($1,659.5 million), resulting in an unfunded pension obligation of $1,095.2 million. This value is then added to the full accumulated benefit obligation for Retiree Health Benefit Plans ($157.7 million) since no plan assets are available for those plans. Therefore, $1,095.2 million + $157.7 million = $1,252.9 million total unfunded obligation.",

      "answer": "The 'Total reclassifications for the period, net of tax' decreased from $357.9 in 2021 to $35.8 in 2023, representing a percentage decrease of approximately 89.97%. This significant decline is primarily driven by the substantial reduction in 'Actuarial losses', which fell from $490.9 in 2021 to $116.2 in 2023. The drop in Actuarial losses accounts for the majority of the overall decrease in total reclassifications, indicating a major shift in retirement benefit-related financial adjustments over the period.",

      "question": "How does the reliance on quoted market values for fair value measurements affect the valuation of both investment-grade publicly traded securities in the trust-owned insurance contract and the company's debt as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "The company relies on quoted market values for determining fair value measurements for both its debt and certain assets. Specifically, the trust-owned insurance contract's cash value is primarily invested in investment-grade publicly traded equity and fixed-income securities, which are valued using quoted market values. Similarly, the company summarizes fair value information for short-term and long-term debt as of December 31, 2023, using the same market-based approach. This reliance on quoted market values means that fluctuations in public market prices directly impact the valuation of these assets and liabilities, creating a parallel sensitivity to market conditions across both categories.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The company summarizes fair value information for short-term and long-term debt as of December 31, 2023, using a market approach based on quoted market values.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The trust-owned insurance contract's cash value is primarily invested in investment-grade publicly traded equity and fixed-income securities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both the valuation of the company's debt and the trust-owned insurance contract's assets depend on quoted market values, meaning that changes in public market prices will simultaneously affect both asset and liability valuations, creating a linked sensitivity to market conditions."

      "answer": "The total value of alternative investments in both the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans is $4,111.7 million. This includes $3,249.0 million in hedge funds, $4,014.1 million in equity-like funds, and $332.8 million in equity-like funds under retiree health benefit plans. The valuation of these alternative investments poses a higher estimation uncertainty because they are primarily valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, which involves significant unobservable inputs and unaudited information, making the fair value calculations more complex and uncertain.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract the total value of alternative investments from evidence_source_b - Defined Benefit Pension Plans include $3,249.0 million in hedge funds and $4,014.1 million in equity-like funds, while Retiree Health Benefit Plans include $332.8 million in equity-like funds.",
        "Step 2: Sum the values of alternative investments across both plans - $3,249.0 million + $4,014.1 million + $332.8 million = $7,595.9 million in alternative investments.",
        "Step 3: Extract the auditor's concern about valuation uncertainty from evidence_source_a - Alternative investments are valued primarily at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary, which involves higher estimation uncertainty due to the use of unaudited information and significant unobservable inputs."

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Benefit Plan Investments,\" the Company's benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in relationship to the respective liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $16,289.0 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 48 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued primarily at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Auditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, particularly the underlying determination of net asset values (\"NAVs\"). Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring investment firms' valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, and obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values.

      "answer": "The Specialty Diagnostics segment is described as providing diagnostic test kits, reagents, and instruments aimed at increasing the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which implies a positive and mission-critical role in healthcare and clinical settings. However, in 2019, the segment reported a significant loss of $471 million, contrasting sharply with its intended function. This loss contributed to the company's overall negative profitability that year, which stood at -$413 million. This reveals a misalignment between the segment's operational goals and its financial performance, suggesting potential inefficiencies or external challenges affecting its ability to generate profit despite its strategic importance.",

      "question": "How did the changes in the discount rate and interest crediting rate for domestic pension benefits in 2021 affect the funded status of TMO's domestic pension plans by the end of 2021, given the interest costs and actuarial gains or losses during the same year?",
      "answer": "The increase in the discount rate from 2.33% in 2020 to 2.70% in 2021 and the rise in the interest crediting rate from 2.16% to 2.58% for domestic pension benefits contributed to a decrease in the benefit obligation and a reduction in interest costs. This is reflected in the interest cost dropping from $35 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021. Additionally, the actuarial gains of $20 million in 2021 further reduced the benefit obligation. As a result, the funded status of the domestic pension plans improved slightly from a deficit of $35 million in 2020 to a deficit of $34 million in 2021.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The discount rate increased from 2.33% in 2020 to 2.70% in 2021, and the interest crediting rate increased from 2.16% to 2.58% for domestic pension benefits.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The interest cost decreased from $35 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021, and actuarial gains of $20 million were recorded in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - The funded status improved slightly from a deficit of $35 million in 2020 to a deficit of $34 million in 2021.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The increase in discount and interest crediting rates reduced the present value of future obligations and lowered interest costs. Combined with actuarial gains, this led to a slight improvement in the funded status of domestic pension plans."

During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5% of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services ($20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($13 million) segments.\n\nThe value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $274 million at December 31, 2020, which was below estimated replacement cost by $49 million. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021.",

      "question": "How did the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Analytical Instruments segment, as noted in the context of the company's financial disclosures, influence the company's use of derivative instruments to manage financial risk in 2022?",
      "answer": "The Analytical Instruments segment was significantly affected by the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the effects lessening in 2021. This history of disruption likely contributed to the company's continued reliance on derivative instruments in 2022 to manage financial risks associated with currency exchange and interest rates. The company used short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts to hedge balance sheet and operational exposures, particularly for intercompany loans and cash balances denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. These actions demonstrate a strategic response to the financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic, aiming to stabilize earnings and manage risks associated with global operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

      "question": "How did the change in the discount rate assumption for domestic pension benefits between 2020 and 2021 impact the interest costs associated with those benefits in 2021?",
      "answer": "The increase in the discount rate from 2.33% in 2020 to 2.70% in 2021 led to a decrease in interest costs for domestic pension benefits from $35 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021. This reflects the inverse relationship between the discount rate and interest costs \u2014 as the discount rate increased, the present value of future obligations decreased, resulting in lower interest costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The interest costs for domestic pension benefits were $23 million in 2021 and $35 million in 2020.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation increased from 2.33% in 2020 to 2.70% in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A higher discount rate reduces the present value of projected benefit obligations, which in turn lowers the interest cost (calculated as a percentage of the obligation). The increase in the discount rate from 2.33% to 2.70% explains the drop in interest costs from $35 million to $23 million."

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThe company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:\n\n## Acquisition-related Measurements\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.",

During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nConditions were strong in each of the company's end markets during 2021.

      "answer": "The change from LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting reduced the cost of product revenues by $33 million in 2021. Additionally, the company recognized a gain of $12 million from currency exchange contracts included in cost of product revenues during 2021. Therefore, the total positive impact on cost of product revenues from both these factors was $45 million.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The cumulative pre-tax effect of the LIFO to FIFO change was $33 million, recorded as a decrease to cost of product revenues in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The gain recognized from currency exchange contracts included in cost of product revenues was $12 million in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine the $33 million decrease in cost of product revenues from the accounting change with the $12 million gain from currency exchange contracts to determine the total $45 million positive impact on cost of product revenues."

          "chunk_text": "\nPrior to the third quarter of 2021, certain of the company's businesses utilized the LIFO method of accounting for inventories. During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5% of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services ($20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($13 million) segments.\n\nThe value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $274 million at December 31, 2020, which was below estimated replacement cost by $49 million. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021.",

      "answer": "The Analytical Instruments segment was significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic, particularly in 2020, which materially affected its results. As a result, the company faced heightened financial and operational risks, prompting increased reliance on derivative instruments to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company used short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts to hedge intercompany loans and cash balances denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and Japanese yen, to mitigate the financial volatility stemming from the pandemic\u2019s impact on global operations.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Analytical Instruments segment was materially adversely affected in 2020 due to reduced customer activity linked to the pandemic.",

However, as a result of the pandemic's impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company's other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nConditions were strong in each of the company's end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company's role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

      "question": "What is the total change in the discount rate for determining benefit obligation between 2020 and 2021 for both domestic and non-U.S. pension benefits, and how does this combined shift reflect on the company's long-term liability assumptions?",
      "answer": "The total change in the discount rate for determining benefit obligation between 2020 and 2021 was 0.37% for domestic pension benefits (from 2.33% to 2.70%) and 0.50% for non-U.S. pension benefits (from 0.95% to 1.45%). Combined, this represents an aggregate increase of 0.87% across both categories. This upward adjustment in discount rates suggests that the company's assumptions for long-term liabilities have shifted toward higher present valuations, which would result in lower reported pension obligations and reduced pressure on future earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The discount rate for domestic pension benefits increased from 2.33% in 2020 to 2.70% in 2021.",

        "Step 5: Sum the changes: 0.37% + 0.50% = 0.87% total increase in discount rate assumptions across both benefit types.",
        "Step 6: Interpret the financial impact: Higher discount rates reduce the present value of future liabilities, thereby lowering reported pension obligations on the balance sheet."

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

However, as a result of the pandemic's impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company's other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand.

By 2021, despite the lingering effects of the pandemic, market conditions improved, with strong performance across the company's end markets, particularly in pharma and biotech. The segment likely benefited from the broader trend of increased demand for analytical tools in vaccine and therapy development, although this recovery followed a weakened 2020 base.

Pro forma adjustments were tax effected at the company's historical statutory rates in effect for the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations that would have been realized had the acquisitions and related financings occurred on the aforementioned dates, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated combined results of operations that the company will experience after the transaction. In addition, the amounts do not include any adjustments for actions that may be taken following the completion of the transaction, such as expected cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements that may be realized subsequent to the transaction.\n\nPro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021, excludes $312 million of transaction costs, initial restructuring costs, and debt extinguishment costs directly attributable to the PPD acquisition that were included in the determination of net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for that period. These items have reduced pro forma net income attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020, by $197 million.\n\nThe company's results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company's other 2021 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2020.\n\nPPD's revenues and losses attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2021, subsequent to the acquisition date, were $378 million and $(60) million, respectively.

However, as a result of the pandemic's impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company's other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nConditions were strong in each of the company's end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company's role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.

While the Opinion rejected  the  IRS's  position  and  the  Tax   Court  determined  the  methodology  advanced  by  Medtronic  was  appropriate  for  purposes  of  determining  the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006.\n- A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.\n- A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.\n- A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company's RCS business.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the net benefit from certain tax  adjustments of $50 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n\n- A benefit of $82 million associated with a step up in tax  basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.\n- A benefit of $82 million related to a change in tax  rates on intangible assets.\n- A cost of $47 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A cost of $41 million associated with a change in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.\n- A net cost of $26 million primarily associated with an intercompany sale of assets.\n\nCurrently, the Company's operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049.

Management expects to move the allocations closer to target over the intermediate term.\n\nRetirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:\n\nShort-term investments: Short-term investments include money market funds. These investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded.\n\nMutual funds: Comprised of investments in equity and fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of mutual funds are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are publicly reported.\n\nEquity commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.\n\nFixed income commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund, either daily or monthly depending on the investment, at market close. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the fund, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical ex pedient.\n\nPartnership units: Partnership units include investment partnerships that provide exposure to long/short equity, absolute return strategies, private equity investments, and real estate investments. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the partnerships, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical ex pedient.\n\nRegistered investment companies: V alued  at  net  asset  values  which  are  not  publicly  reported.  The  net  asset  values  are  calculated  based  on  the  valuation  of  the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\n\nInsurance contracts: Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies.

This change was influenced by $67 million in total realized gains and $151 million in total unrealized gains, offset by $238 million in net purchases and sales. The valuation methodology for Partnership Units relies on net asset values reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of underlying assets, which are not publicly reported, and are valued using the net asset value practical expedient.

These investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded.\n\nMutual funds: Comprised of investments in equity and fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of mutual funds are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are publicly reported.\n\nEquity commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.\n\nFixed income commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund, either daily or monthly depending on the investment, at market close. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the fund, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical ex pedient.\n\nPartnership units: Partnership units include investment partnerships that provide exposure to long/short equity, absolute return strategies, private equity investments, and real estate investments. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the partnerships, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical ex pedient.\n\nRegistered investment companies: V alued  at  net  asset  values  which  are  not  publicly  reported.  The  net  asset  values  are  calculated  based  on  the  valuation  of  the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\n\nInsurance contracts: Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer, and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company's general portfolio and participate in the insurer's profit-sharing policy on an ex cess yield basis.\n\nMeasurement using net asset value as a practical expedient is not used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different than the reported net asset value.\n\nThe methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.",

While the Opinion rejected  the  IRS's  position  and  the  Tax   Court  determined  the  methodology  advanced  by  Medtronic  was  appropriate  for  purposes  of  determining  the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006.\n- A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.\n- A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.\n- A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company's RCS business.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the net benefit from certain tax  adjustments of $50 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n\n- A benefit of $82 million associated with a step up in tax  basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.\n- A benefit of $82 million related to a change in tax  rates on intangible assets.\n- A cost of $47 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n- A cost of $41 million associated with a change in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.\n- A net cost of $26 million primarily associated with an intercompany sale of assets.\n\nCurrently, the Company's operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049.

This change, along with the contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses, led to the Medical Surgical Portfolio being temporarily split into two operating segments during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. However, due to the February 2024 decision to exit the ventilator product line and consolidate the remaining PMRI businesses, the two operating segments within the Medical Surgical Portfolio were later combined back into one operating segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, with the ventilator product line moved to the 'Other' line.",

Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS have reached agreement on all significant issues except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court matter for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n\nMedtronic, Inc.'s fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax  returns are currently being audited by the IRS.\n\nCovidien LP (a wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc) has either reached agreement with the IRS or the statute of limitations has lapsed on its U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal year 2020.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\nRefer to Note 13 for additional discussion of income taxes.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates' products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers  warranties  on  various  products.  The  Company's  maximum  exposure  under  these  guarantees  is  unable  to  be  estimated.  Historically,  the  Company  has  not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.\n\nThe Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n\n## 19. Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThere were no changes to the reportable segments during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. We continue to have four reportable segments: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit. However, there were changes to the operating segments during fiscal year 2024 as a result of how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses business performance. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Medical Surgical Portfolio was separated into two operating segments as a result of the previously contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses, which were previously aggregated based upon similar economic and operating characteristics. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, there were certain Medical Surgical businesses that were moved to the Other line, which primarily related to wind-down activity of the Company's Renal Care Solutions business that was contributed to Mozarc Medical in April 2023. Subsequently, as a result of the February 2024 decision to exit the Company's ventilator product line and retain and combine the remaining PMRI businesses into one business unit as further discussed in Note 3, the two operating segments within the Medical Surgical Portfolio were combined into one operating segment, and the Company's ventilator product line, which was in the Medical Surgical Portfolio, was moved to the Other line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The four principal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Cardiovascular Portfolio segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart and vascular-related disorders and diseases.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Neuroscience Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.\n\nThe primary products and services from which the Medical Surgical Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, obesity, and other preventable complications.",

      "answer": "Since lessor income is recognized within net sales and is tied to lease arrangements where Medtronic provides equipment and customers purchase accompanying consumables, but this income and related assets are explicitly stated as 'not material' to the consolidated financial statements for both fiscal years 2024 and 2023, it indicates that lease-based revenue contributes only marginally to overall revenue stability. This implies that Medtronic does not strategically emphasize lease arrangements as a core revenue driver, instead relying more heavily on direct sales and consumables. Therefore, the company's financial performance and strategic direction in the Health Care sector are not significantly influenced by lessor income.",

      "answer": "The net sales from the 'Other operating segment' decreased by $506 million (from $727 million in 2022 to $221 million in 2024), contributing to a slight overall change in total net sales of MDT, which remained relatively stable at around $31.7 billion to $32.4 billion. Over the same period, the depreciation expense for this segment dropped from $18 million in 2022 to $0 in 2024, reflecting a reduction in capital assets or a shift in asset composition.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 'Other operating segment' net sales were $727 million in 2022 and $221 million in 2024, indicating a decrease of $506 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The depreciation expense for the 'Other operating segment' was $18 million in 2022 and $0 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The significant drop in net sales from the 'Other operating segment' had a minimal impact on total net sales due to its small size relative to the overall company. The depreciation expense change reflects a likely reduction in capital assets or a strategic shift in this segment."

      "answer": "The total anticipated pension contribution for fiscal year 2025 is $75 million, with $30 million allocated to U.S. pension benefit plans and $45 million to non-U.S. pension benefit plans. The Level 3 non-U.S. pension benefit assets decreased from $44 million in 2023 to $42 million in 2024, indicating a slight decline in assets valued using significant unobservable inputs. This reduction may signal increased valuation uncertainty or lower liquidity in certain non-U.S. pension investments. However, the company believes that pension assets, returns on invested pension assets, and planned contributions will still be sufficient to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future, suggesting a continued confidence in funding despite the Level 3 asset decrease.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The company anticipates making $30 million and $45 million contributions to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal year 2025.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Non-U.S. pension benefit assets valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) decreased from $44 million in 2023 to $42 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The total anticipated 2025 pension contribution is calculated by summing the U.S. and non-U.S. contributions. The slight decline in Level 3 assets may reflect higher risk or reduced confidence in valuations of non-U.S. pension investments, but the company still asserts that combined assets and contributions will meet future obligations."
