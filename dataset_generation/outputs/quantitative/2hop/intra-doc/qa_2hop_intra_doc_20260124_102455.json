      "question": "What was the net change in Linde's ordinary share transactions in 2024, and how did this impact the company's overall financing activities cash flow compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "The net change in Linde's ordinary share transactions in 2024 was -$4,451 million (issuances of $31 million minus purchases of $4,482 million). This resulted in a net cash outflow of $4,451 million, contributing to the overall financing activities cash outflow of $4,359 million in 2024. Compared to 2023, where the net outflow from share transactions was $3,925 million, the 2024 outflow increased by $526 million, worsening the net cash outflow from financing activities by $1,041 million year-over-year.",

      "answer": "The $43 million benefit from the APAC divestiture reduced the overall cost reduction program charges for 2024, which totaled $145 million and included $165 million in severance and $23 million in other cost reduction charges. Separately, the $69 million in net proceeds from the APAC divestiture contributed to Linde's total divestiture proceeds of $170 million in 2024. Therefore, the divestiture had a dual impact: it directly lowered the cost reduction charges through a financial benefit and increased the total proceeds from divestitures during the year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cost reduction program and other charges were $145 million in 2024, including severance of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and a $43 million benefit from the APAC divestiture.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Divestiture proceeds in 2024 included $69 million in net proceeds for the APAC divestiture.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The APAC divestiture contributed both a $43 million benefit that offset cost reduction charges and generated $69 million in net proceeds, contributing to the total $170 million in divestiture proceeds for 2024."

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2024 Compared With 2023\n\n## Sales\n\nLinde sales were flat for the 2024 year versus 2023. Sales grew 2% from higher price attainment. Volumes were flat, as new project start-ups were largely offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers decreased sales by 1%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\nCost of sales, ex clusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $349 million, or 2%, for the year primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 51.9% and 53.2% of sales, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG &amp;A\") increased $42 million, or 1%, from $3,295 million in 2023 to $3,337 million in 2024 driven by higher costs. SG &amp;A was 10.1% of sales in 2024 versus 10.0% in 2023. Currency impacts decreased SG&amp;A by approximately $28 million in 2024.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $36 million, or 1%, versus 2023. The decrease is due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger partially offset by the net impact of new project start ups.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $32 million, or 1%, versus 2023. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $17 million in 2024. Ex cluding currency, underlying depreciation and amortization increased due to the net impact of new project start ups.\n\n## Cost reduction program and other charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million and $40 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2024 includes severance charges of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and other benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. In 2023, the costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, these charges have been excluded in both periods.\n\n## Other income (expense) - net\n\nReported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of $185 million in 2024 and expense of $41 million in 2023. In 2024, other income included a benefit of $41 million related to a settlement with a supplier in the Americas and $45 million in insurance recoveries primarily within the Other segment (Note 7).\n\n## Operating profit",

The fair value of property, plant &amp; equipment, net was based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The cost approach, adjusted for the age and condition of the property, plant and equipment, was used to estimate fair value.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer relationships of approximately $245 million that will be amortized over their estimated useful life of 20 years. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from nexAir, LLC's existing customer base. There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets identified in conjunction with the acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the consideration for the acquisition over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition resulted in $485 million of goodwill, the majority of which is ex pected to be deductible for tax  purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and operating synergies expected to result from the acquisition. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was allocated to the Americas reportable segment, which represents the reportable segment anticipated to experience operating synergies as a result of the acquisition.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales were $170 million, $70 million, and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## 2022 Sale of GIST business\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its GIST business. Proceeds from the sale were $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $21 million (benefit of $3 million, after tax ), recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 3).\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAM AND OTHER CHARGES\n\n## 2024 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Costs include severance of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and a benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2024 included an income tax benefit of $35 million.\n\n## 2023 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2023 included an income tax benefit of $81 million primarily comprised of a benefit of $124 million related to the resolution of an income tax audit, partially offset by an accrual of $85 million for the potential settlement of an international income tax  matter.\n\n## 2022 Charges\n\nCost  reduction  program  and  other  charges  were  $1  billion  ($896  million,  after  tax   and  noncontrolling  interests)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., have imposed several tranches of economic sanctions on Russia. As a result, Linde reassessed its ability to control its Russian subsidiaries and determined that as of June 30, 2022 it can no longer ex ercise control over these entities. As such, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax ).\n\nThe fair value of Linde's Russian subsidiaries was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, which resulted in the recognition of a $407 million loss on deconsolidation when compared to the carrying value of the entities. This loss is recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statements of income.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - While the cash flow statement shows a positive cash inflow of $31 million from share issuances, the equity statement reflects a $150 million reduction in equity associated with these issuances, likely due to the specific accounting treatment of employee savings and incentive plans."

The fair value of property, plant &amp; equipment, net was based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The cost approach, adjusted for the age and condition of the property, plant and equipment, was used to estimate fair value.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer relationships of approximately $245 million that will be amortized over their estimated useful life of 20 years. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from nexAir, LLC's existing customer base. There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets identified in conjunction with the acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the consideration for the acquisition over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition resulted in $485 million of goodwill, the majority of which is ex pected to be deductible for tax  purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and operating synergies expected to result from the acquisition. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was allocated to the Americas reportable segment, which represents the reportable segment anticipated to experience operating synergies as a result of the acquisition.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales were $170 million, $70 million, and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## 2022 Sale of GIST business\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its GIST business. Proceeds from the sale were $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $21 million (benefit of $3 million, after tax ), recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 3).\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAM AND OTHER CHARGES\n\n## 2024 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Costs include severance of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and a benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2024 included an income tax benefit of $35 million.\n\n## 2023 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2023 included an income tax benefit of $81 million primarily comprised of a benefit of $124 million related to the resolution of an income tax audit, partially offset by an accrual of $85 million for the potential settlement of an international income tax  matter.\n\n## 2022 Charges\n\nCost  reduction  program  and  other  charges  were  $1  billion  ($896  million,  after  tax   and  noncontrolling  interests)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., have imposed several tranches of economic sanctions on Russia. As a result, Linde reassessed its ability to control its Russian subsidiaries and determined that as of June 30, 2022 it can no longer ex ercise control over these entities. As such, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax ).\n\nThe fair value of Linde's Russian subsidiaries was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, which resulted in the recognition of a $407 million loss on deconsolidation when compared to the carrying value of the entities. This loss is recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statements of income.",

      "answer": "Linde plc's purchases of ordinary shares in 2024 amounted to $4,459 million, which directly reduced total equity under 'Treasury Shares' and also represented a major outflow in financing activities, totaling $4,482 million. The combined dollar effect of these transactions on both equity and financing cash flow was a reduction of approximately $8,941 million.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 'Purchases of ordinary shares' in 2024 reduced equity by $4,459 million under 'Treasury Shares'.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 'Purchases of ordinary shares' in 2024 are listed as a cash outflow of $4,482 million under financing activities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both metrics reflect the share repurchase activity, with slight differences due to rounding or reporting timing. The combined impact is the sum of both figures, showing a significant outflow from the company related to share repurchases."

As of December 31, 2024, there were four Red Zone plans, deemed to be in \"critical\" or \"critical and declining\" status that have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans.

This is calculated by referencing the $890 million total Russia charges from the detailed breakdown and comparing it to the $1,434 million total provision for income taxes, where Russia charges are explicitly stated as 1.9% of that total.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - The total Russia-related charge for 2022 was $890 million, as shown under the 'Total' row in the 'Total Russia charges' column.",

      "answer": "In 2024, Linde plc's noncontrolling interest transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of $420 million, compared to $53 million in 2023. This represents an increase in cash outflow of $367 million year-over-year. This larger outflow contributed to the overall net cash used for financing activities of $4,359 million in 2024, which, combined with other financing activities, led to a small increase in cash and cash equivalents of $186 million by the end of the year.",

During this same period, gross receivables aged greater than one year decreased from $354 million to $322 million, a reduction of $32 million.

      "answer": "The increase in net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments, reduced cash flow from operations by $118 million in 2024 compared to the prior year.

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Cash flow from operations was $9,423 million in 2024, which was $118 million higher than in 2023.",

Sales increased 2% from higher price attainment primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments. Sales from volume were flat as growth from new project start-ups was offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, largely in the Americas and APAC.\n- Reported operating profit of $8,635 million was 8% above 2023 reported operating profit of $8,024 million. Adjusted operating profit of $9,720 million was 7% above 2023 adjusted operating profit of $9,070 million. The increase in the reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives in 2024. These increases more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation and currency translation.*\n- Net income - Linde plc of $6,565 million and diluted earnings per share of $13.62 increased from $6,199 million and $12.59, respectively in 2023. Adjusted net income - Linde plc of $7,475 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.51 were 7% above 2023 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,423 million was $118 million above 2023. The increase was driven by higher net income, partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $4,497 million; dividends paid were $2,655 million; net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million; and debt borrowings, net were $3,167 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2025 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

Averaging the two perspectives, cost pass-through consistently contributes a (1)% drag, and currency contributes a (1.5)% drag, totaling a (2.5)% negative impact. However, since both chunks together indicate a consistent (2%) net negative effect when considering overlapping data points, the most grounded synthesis is a (2)% total negative impact.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

Total charges related to the cost reduction programs were $338 million ($253 million, after tax), $391 million ($277 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests), and $304 million ($233 million, after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Severance costs\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, severance costs of $259 million were recorded for the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions. Severance costs of $298 million and $204 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were recorded for the elimination of approximately 3,100 and 2,400 positions, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the actions have been taken, with the remaining actions planned to be completed within the next 12 months.\n\n## Other cost reduction charges\n\nOther cost reduction charges were $79 million, $93 million, and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

The cumulative effect of these charges, along with other components like interest cost and expected return on plan assets, resulted in a significant net benefit of $(35 million) in 2021 compared to a cost of $107 million in 2019.

The decrease in proceeds from divestitures in 2021 compared to 2020, which was $315 million lower ($482 million in 2020 minus $167 million in 2021), contributed to an increase in net cash used for investing activities by $21 million ($3,007 million in 2021 minus $2,986 million in 2020), as lower proceeds from divestitures were only partially offset by reduced capital expenditures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements.\n- Reference  Rate  Reform -  In  March  2020  with  amendments  in  2021,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  related  to reference  rate  reform  which  provides  practical  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  U.S.  GAAP  to  contract modifications,  hedging  relationships  and  other  transactions  that  the  reference  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates. This update is applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. The amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through December 31, 2022.

In addition, divestitures include $0.5 billion of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the Americas under other agreements. These transactions were completed on March 1, 2019.\n- On April 30, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde South Korea with the sale price of $1.2 billion to IMM Private Equity Inc., to satisfy requirements of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The assets divested include bulk and on-site business in Giheung, Pohang and Seosan sites as well as oxygen and nitrogen on-site generators.\n- On December 16, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde India with a sale price of $193 million.\n- In March 2020, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde China with a sale price of $98 million.",

The total 'Severance costs' for the same period amount to $761 million ($204 million in 2019 + $298 million in 2020 + $259 million in 2021).

Linde plc's net income for 2021 was $3,826 million on sales of $30,793 million, resulting in a net income margin of approximately 12.4%.

      "answer": "The Net Pension and OPEB Cost (Benefit) improved from a cost of $192 million in 2021 to a benefit of $164 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the Expected Return on Plan Assets (from $521 million in 2021 to $523 million in 2023) and a significant rise in the Interest Cost (from $154 million in 2021 to $373 million in 2023). This net improvement of $28 million (from -$192M to +$164M) positively impacted Operating Profit, contributing to a higher Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments of $7,988 million in 2023 compared to $5,099 million in 2021.",

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, Linde recorded a total retained liability of $75 million for claims incurred and unpaid. Linde estimates this liability using statistical analysis, historical experience, actuarial assumptions, and professional judgment. This estimation process accounts for the company's self-retained risk levels, which include up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the U.S., $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability, and \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million for property damage and business interruption perils globally. These self-retained risk levels directly inform the assumptions used in the liability estimation process, as higher retained risk could lead to greater variability in ultimate claim costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Linde recorded $75 million retained liability for claims incurred and unpaid as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Linde estimates liability using statistical analysis, historical experience, actuarial assumptions, and professional judgment.",
        "Step 3: Extract from both sources - Linde self-retains risk up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the U.S., $5 million for workers' compensation and general liability, and \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million for property damage and business interruption globally.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The retained liability estimation process incorporates the company's self-retained risk levels, as these thresholds determine the portion of losses Linde is exposed to before insurance coverage applies, directly influencing the magnitude and variability of the estimated liability."

      "answer": "The year-over-year percentage point increase in Operating Profit as Percent of Sales for LIN in 2023 was 1.7 percentage points (from 25.8% in 2022 to 27.5% in 2023). This margin expansion was supported by a 4% increase in sales attributed to Price/Mix and a 2% increase from Volume/Equipment, which together contributed 6% of the overall sales growth. Given that operating profit grew by 8%, faster than the 1% total sales growth, these positive contributions from Price/Mix and Volume/Equipment likely played a significant role in improving profitability by enhancing revenue quality and leveraging fixed costs.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Price/Mix contributed 4% and Volume/Equipment contributed 2% to sales growth.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 6% combined contribution from Price/Mix and Volume/Equipment suggests stronger pricing power and volume leverage, which typically translate into better margin performance. This aligns with the 8% growth in operating profit, indicating that these factors contributed not only to revenue growth but also to margin expansion."

However, this mechanism contributed to a 6% negative variance in sales performance in 2023 compared to 2022.

      "question": "How much did Linde plc's net purchases of ordinary shares in 2023 reduce the company's total equity, and how does this compare to the net cash outflow from issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares in the financing activities section?",
      "answer": "Linde plc's net purchases of ordinary shares in 2023 reduced the company's total equity by $4,003 million, as reflected in the Shareholders' Equity table. This matches the net cash outflow of $3,925 million from issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares reported in the Financing Activities section, showing a direct financial impact of share repurchases on both equity and cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The net cash outflow from issuances (purchases) of ordinary shares in 2023 was $3,925 million (negative value), as reported in the Financing Activities section.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The purchases of ordinary shares in 2023 totaled $4,003 million, which reduced Linde plc Shareholders' Equity by the same amount.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The reduction in equity from share repurchases aligns with the cash outflow reported in the financing activities, showing how share buybacks directly affect both equity and cash flows."
