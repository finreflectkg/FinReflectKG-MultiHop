      "question": "By how much did the reduction in Mellanox acquisition-related charges and the shift in product mix across segments contribute to the overall gross margin increase from 62.3% in fiscal year 2021 to 64.9% in fiscal year 2022?",
      "answer": "The overall gross margin increased by 2.6 percentage points from 62.3% in fiscal year 2021 to 64.9% in fiscal year 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the reduction in Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021, and a higher-end mix within the Graphics segment. However, this was partially offset by a mix shift within the Compute & Networking segment.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021, and a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking."

We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during  fiscal  year  2022  resulted  from  a  combination  of  factors,  including:  the  ramp  of  new  RTX  30  Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nCompute &amp; Networking Compute &amp; Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\n\n## Concentration of Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location  to  which  the  products  are  initially  billed  even  if  the  revenue  is  attributable  to  end  customers  in  a  different location.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost  of  semiconductors,  including  wafer  fabrication,  assembly,  testing  and  packaging,  board  and  device  costs, manufacturing  support  costs,  including  labor  and  overhead  associated  with  such  purchases,  final  test  yield  fallout, inventory  and  warranty  provisions,  memory  and  component  costs,  tariffs,  and  shipping  costs.  Cost  of  revenue  also includes  acquisition-related  costs,  development  costs  for  license  and  service  arrangements,  IP-related  costs,  and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022  was  primarily  due  to  lower  Mellanox  acquisition-related  charges,  including  a  non-recurring  inventory  step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute &amp; Networking.\n\nInventory  provisions  totaled  $354  million  and  $116  million  for  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Sales  of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe gross  margin  of  our  Graphics  segment  increased  during  fiscal  year  2022  when  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021, primarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs.\n\nThe gross margin of our Compute &amp; Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year  2021,  primarily  due  to  a  shift  in  product  mix  and  partially  offset  by  a  reduced  contribution  from  Automotive solutions.",

In 2021, the same adjustments contributed 1.6%, increasing the GAAP gross margin from 55.4% to 58.1%. This reveals that Intel's acquisition strategy had a larger financial impact on its core operational performance in 2023 than in 2021, as the adjustments to gross margin were higher, indicating a greater influence of amortization charges from acquisitions on the company's reported Non-GAAP performance.",

Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years. | We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition- related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Share-based compensation         | Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance.

        "Step 3: Synthesize - While the tax benefit increased significantly in 2023, net income still declined sharply, suggesting that the underlying operating performance deteriorated substantially, offsetting the benefit from lower taxes."

      "question": "What was the dollar amount decrease in Oracle's EMEA hardware revenues from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, and how did this minimal decline compare to the more significant drop in the Americas region during the same period?",
      "answer": "Oracle's EMEA hardware revenues decreased by $12 million from $933 million in fiscal year 2023 to $921 million in fiscal year 2024. This minimal decline of -1% in actual terms contrasts with the more significant drop in the Americas region, where hardware revenues fell by $208 million\u2014from $1,702 million in fiscal year 2023 to $1,494 million in fiscal year 2024\u2014a decline of -12%. This shows that while Oracle experienced a modest revenue contraction in EMEA, the Americas saw a much sharper decline, contributing more significantly to the overall -6% drop in total hardware revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract EMEA hardware revenues for 2023 ($933 million) and 2024 ($921 million) to calculate the dollar decrease ($933M - $921M = $12M).",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract Americas hardware revenues for 2023 ($1,702 million) and 2024 ($1,494 million) to calculate the dollar decrease ($1,702M - $1,494M = $208M).",
        "Step 3: Compare the percentage decline in EMEA (-1%) to that in the Americas (-12%), showing a stark contrast in regional performance.",
        "Step 4: Link both regional changes to the overall hardware revenue decline of -6%, demonstrating how the Americas decline had a larger impact than EMEA."

According to Oracle's disclosures, international environmental regulations such as the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, and the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism may increase the company's cost of doing business internationally and impact hardware revenues from the EU, China, and other countries with similar environmental legislation.",

If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.\n\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these operations, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Regulatory, market, carbon tax and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.\n\nApproximately half of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products and the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations, i nsurance premiums and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fi nes, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the fi nancial condition or operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and periodically reviews our environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs, including environmental sustainability. We also have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, i ncluding service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. Any failure to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.\n\nWe publish an annual Social Impact Report, which includes disclosure of our ESG matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives and activities.\n\nFurther, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital and diversity, some of which require specific, target-driven frameworks or disclosure requirements, are being developed, formalized and implemented in many j urisdictions. Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures, are complex and evolving, and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose significant compliance costs. In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESG-related disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and standards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors. Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is l a rgely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. We typically have a number of large transactions each quarter, which increases",

      "answer": "Oracle's Hardware Revenues decreased by $208 million (from $3,274 million in fiscal 2023 to $3,066 million in fiscal 2024) in constant currency terms. Despite this revenue decline and lower total expenses ($1,342 million in 2023 to $1,151 million in 2024), the total margin percentage increased from 59% to 62%, indicating improved efficiency or cost control relative to the drop in revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract Hardware Revenues for fiscal 2023 ($3,274 million) and fiscal 2024 ($3,066 million) to calculate the $208 million decrease.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, note that the total margin percentage increased from 59% (2023) to 62% (2024) despite lower revenues.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a, it is stated that total margin as a percentage of revenues increased due to lower total expenses, which aligns with the $191 million drop in total expenses (from $1,342 million to $1,151 million) shown in evidence_source_b.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the data: Although hardware revenues decreased significantly, the margin percentage improved due to more substantial cost reductions."

During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recorded net increases of $54,777 and $243,446 in the valuation allowance, respectively, primarily related to valuation allowances on certain tax credit carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.\n\nWe had tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2022 of $940,640, of which $12,119 will expire between 2023 and 2032, $1,027 will expire between 2033 and 2042, and $927,494 has an indefinite carryforward period. We had net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2022 of $857,615. Of this amount, $174,669 expires between 2023 and 2032, $80,604 expires between 2033 and 2042, and $602,342 has an indefinite carryforward period.\n\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had $1,469,336 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $1,083,065, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. As of August 31, 2021, we had $1,344,460 of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $1,028,090, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 of $386,271 and $316,370, respectively, represent items recorded as offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes and timing adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that mature in approximately one year to hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances. These treasury rate locks were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedging instruments. In August 2023, we early settled all treasury rate lock contracts, which had a $5.5 billion notional amount, for a cumulative gain of $371 million. The cumulative gain was recorded net of tax of $44 million as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of October 29, 2023. The cash receipts from the settlement were included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during fiscal year 2023. In fiscal year 2024, upon the issuance of our $1.75 billion 4.800% senior notes due October 2034 as discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings', $75 million out of the $371 million pre-tax cumulative gain in accumulated other comprehensive income will be amortized to interest expense through October 15, 2034 using the effective interest method. The remaining cumulative gain will be amortized to interest expense associated with future debt referencing the hedged treasury rates.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in progress until placed in service, upon which date, we begin to depreciate these assets. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property, plant and equipment balances and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over 15 to 40 years, or over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.\n\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating l ease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our i ncremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and i ncentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective interest method over the lease term.\n\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\n\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance on fair value measurements are described below:\n\nLevel 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.\n\nLevel 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or i ndirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair",

      "answer": "Broadcom recognizes secure supply fees as part of the transaction price for product orders, which means these fees are included in the total revenue for the contract. However, the revenue from these fees is only realized in the period when control over the associated products is transferred to the customer, ensuring alignment with the company's revenue recognition policy tied to the fulfillment of performance obligations.",

We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party's rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, and terms between invoicing and when payment is due are short-term in duration. The timing of revenue recognition and required payments can differ and payment terms are generally structured to provide the customer with predictable and dependable ways to procure our products, not to provide or receive financing from the customer.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\nOur products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue.\n\nProducts. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. Rebates and incentives offered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude from the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product. From time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for prioritized fulfillment of product orders. Such fees are included in the transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that control over the products is transferred to the customer.\n\nSubscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software arrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering ('NRE') arrangements.\n\nRevenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or in installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support and maintenance, and utilize our professional services.\n\nOur software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of software arrangements, customers derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide. Certain of our subscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangements at any ti me at the customer's convenience, referred to as termination for convenience provisions, without substantive termination penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with these termination for convenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting i n ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period.\n\nSupport services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\n\nProfessional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services. The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations.\n\nRights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the l i cense of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.\n\nThere are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE contracts in which we develop a custom chip and (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the customer's request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over time criteria. As such, revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on costs incurred to total cost as the services are provided. For NRE contracts that do not meet the over time criteria, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the NRE services are complete.\n\nMaterial rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance obligations. These include the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the right expires.",

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - For the same years, the reclassification adjustments for recognized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities were 0, (1), and 0 million dollars respectively.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The net increase (decrease) from available-for-sale securities is calculated by summing the unrealized gains/losses and reclassification adjustments for each year: (8) + 0 = (8) for 2021, 3 + (1) = 2 for 2020, and 29 + 0 = 29 for 2019.

(ADBE) over the three fiscal years ending November 29, 2024, December 1, 2023, and December 2, 2022, and how does this trend compare to the changes in unrealized gains/losses on those securities?",
      "answer": "The total cumulative net increase (decrease) from available-for-sale securities for Adobe Inc. (ADBE) over the three fiscal years is $-9 million. This is calculated by summing the net increases/decreases: $11 million (2024) + $29 million (2023) + $(-39) million (2022) = $-9 million. The unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities were $11 million (2024), $24 million (2023), and $(-39) million (2022), which closely aligns with the net changes, indicating minimal impact from reclassification adjustments over the period.",

Everyone has a story to tell and needs products and services at their fingertips to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvases. AI- and generative AI-powered technologies are increasing this opportunity by growing the demand for and production of content. This shift is changing how creative professionals work by accelerating their processes, increasing their productivity, and allowing them to explore and create in new fields, while empowering new creators by dramatically lowering barriers to creativity. At the same time, creativity is increasingly a team effort that is redefining productivity, making quick and easy collaboration even more critical to every company's success. Adobe is driving innovation to shape these trends, democratize creativity, empower individuals to create wherever inspiration strikes and enable more effective collaboration between creators and stakeholders.\n\nThe  flagship  of  our  Digital  Media  business  is Adobe  Creative  Cloud,  a  subscription  service  that  allows  subscribers  to  use  our  creative  products  and applications ('Apps') integrated with cloud-delivered services across various surfaces and platforms. We believe in creativity for all, and Creative Cloud addresses the needs of all content creators, from creative professionals, such as artists, designers, developers, students, and administrators, to knowledge workers, marketers, educators,  enthusiasts,  communicators,  and  consumers.

We believe we have significant opportunities to grow our  Digital  Media business by advancing every creative category across all surfaces; expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express; enabling seamless collaboration across all stakeholders; inspiring the creative community through sharing and monetization; and expanding the user base of our tools through the infusion of AI into our products, services and solutions to enable users of any skill level to easily and efficiently create content.\n\nOur  Digital  Media  segment  includes  our Adobe  Document  Cloud  business,  a  unified,  cloud-based  document  services  platform  that  integrates Adobe's pioneering PDF technology with our Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Scan and Adobe Acrobat Sign Apps to deliver fully digital document workflows across all surfaces.

These  performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management's judgment.\n\nThe Company has the following two reportable segments:\n\n- the  Computing  and  Graphics  segment,  which  primarily  includes  desktop  and  notebook  microprocessors, accelerated  processing  units that integrate  microprocessors  and  graphics,  chipsets,  discrete  graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs, and development services. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\n- the  Enterprise,  Embedded  and  Semi-Custom  segment,  which  primarily  includes  server  and  embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, development services and technology for game consoles. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\n\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments.  This  category  primarily  includes  employee  stock-based  compensation  expense  and  acquisition-related costs.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n",

      "answer": "The net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash for AMD was $125 million in 2020 and $940 million in 2021, resulting in a difference of $815 million. This significant increase corresponds with a rise in net cash provided by operating activities, which grew from $1,071 million in 2020 to $3,521 million in 2021, reflecting an increase of $2,450 million.

      "answer": "The total effect of dilutive potential common shares over fiscal years 2020 through 2022 was 54 million shares (18 million in 2020, 14 million in 2021, and 22 million in 2022). In 2022, this dilution of 22 million shares caused the weighted-average shares-diluted to increase to 4,192 million from 4,170 million basic shares, resulting in a slight decrease in net income per share from $2.83 (basic) to $2.82 (diluted).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 'Effect of dilutive potential common shares' for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are 18, 14, and 22 million shares, respectively.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 'Weighted-average shares-basic' in 2022 was 4,170 million and 'Weighted-average shares-diluted' was 4,192 million, showing an increase due to dilutive shares. Also, the 'Net income per share-basic' was $2.83 and 'Net income per share-diluted' was $2.82.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The total dilutive effect over the three years is the sum of 18 + 14 + 22 = 54 million shares. In 2022 specifically, the 22 million dilutive shares increased the share count from 4,170 million to 4,192 million, which led to a $0.01 decrease in net income per share due to spreading the same net income over more shares."

      "answer": "The 2024 U.S. discount rate for determining net periodic pension expense is 5.00%, while the 2022 Non-U.S. discount rate for the same metric is 2.41%. The difference between these two rates is 2.59 percentage points. This reflects an increasing trend in the discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension expense, suggesting that the company expects higher interest rates to reduce the present value of future pension obligations over time.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 2024 U.S. discount rate for determining net periodic pension expense is 5.00%.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The increase in discount rate from 2022 (Non-U.S.) to 2024 (U.S.) indicates a trend toward higher assumptions in pension cost calculations, likely reflecting rising interest rates and their impact on pension liabilities."

      "question": "How has the Embedded segment's operating margin trended from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the segment's cost management relative to its revenue changes?",
      "answer": "The Embedded segment's operating margin decreased from 49.5% in 2022 ($2,252M operating income on $4,552M net revenue) to 49.3% in 2023 ($2,628M operating income on $5,321M net revenue), and further declined to 40.0% in 2024 ($1,421M operating income on $3,557M net revenue). This indicates that while revenue declined significantly in 2024, operating income fell even more sharply, suggesting deteriorating cost management or increased cost pressures despite lower revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract Embedded segment net revenue and operating income for 2022 ($4,552M revenue, $2,252M operating income), 2023 ($5,321M revenue, $2,628M operating income), and 2024 ($3,557M revenue, $1,421M operating income).",
        "Step 2: Calculate operating margins for each year by dividing operating income by net revenue: 2022 (2,252 / 4,552 = 49.5%), 2023 (2,628 / 5,321 = 49.3%), and 2024 (1,421 / 3,557 = 40.0%).",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, observe that Embedded segment goodwill remains relatively stable (from $21,055M in 2022 to $21,072M in 2024), indicating no major acquisitions or write-downs affecting the trend.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The declining operating margin despite stable goodwill suggests that the drop in profitability is operationally driven, not due to acquisition-related costs, pointing to challenges in managing costs relative to revenue declines."

      "answer": "The total value of common stock issued under employee equity plans by AMD over the three-year period is $51 million ($17 million in 2022, $17 million in 2023, and $17 million in 2024). In 2024 specifically, the $17 million in new stock issuance contributed to the increase in the balance of common stock from $1,616 million at the beginning of the period to $1,622 million at the end of the period, despite the offsetting effects of $6 million in stock repurchases and $5 million in repurchases for tax withholding.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The value of common stock issued under employee equity plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024 is $17 million each year.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The balance of common stock at the beginning of 2024 was $1,616 million and increased to $1,622 million at the end of 2024, with $17 million in new stock issuance and reductions of $6 million from repurchases and $5 million from tax withholdings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Summing the annual values from Step 1 gives the total over the three-year period. The contribution of the 2024 issuance to the change in stock balance is calculated by subtracting the total outflows from the inflow in 2024."

These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially  offset by  lower maturities and sales of short-term inv estments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.\n\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024.

Our investing capital expenditures were $23.9 billion in 2024 ($25.8 billion in 2023 and $24.8 billion in 2022).\n\nThe decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially  offset by  lower maturities and sales of short-term inv estments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.\n\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the restructuring of certain non-US subsidiaries contributed a 15.8% increase to Intel's effective tax rate, and the non-deductibility of the European Commission fine added an additional 11.1%, resulting in a combined 26.9% increase. In 2022, the restructuring contributed 2.2% and there was no impact from the European Commission fine (non-deductibility was not listed), resulting in a combined 2.2% increase.

      "answer": "NVIDIA reported a net loss of $100 million on investments in non-affiliated entities in fiscal year 2022 and a net gain of $45 million in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, NVIDIA had net cash outflows from investments in non-affiliated entities and other of $24 million in fiscal year 2022 and $77 million in fiscal year 2023. These losses, gains, and outflows contributed to the changes in NVIDIA's cash and cash equivalents, which increased from $1,990 million at the end of fiscal year 2022 to $3,389 million at the end of fiscal year 2023.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NVIDIA had net cash outflows from investments in non-affiliated entities and other of $24 million in fiscal year 2022 and $77 million in fiscal year 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combining these figures shows the financial impact of NVIDIA's investment activities over the two fiscal years, which influenced the company's overall cash position.",

      "question": "How did the absence of acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2024 impact NVIDIA's total operating expenses compared to fiscal year 2023, and what was the resulting percentage change in operating expenses as a proportion of net revenue?",
      "answer": "The absence of the $1,353 million acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2024 contributed to a decrease in NVIDIA's total operating expenses by $1,353 million compared to fiscal year 2023. This led to a reduction in total operating expenses from 41.3% to 18.6% of net revenue, a decrease of 22.7 percentage points.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA incurred an acquisition termination cost of $1,353 million, which was absent in fiscal year 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Total operating expenses decreased from $11,132 million in fiscal year 2023 to $11,329 million in fiscal year 2024, a net increase of $197 million. However, without the $1,353 million termination cost in 2023, the adjusted 2023 operating expenses would have been $9,779 million, making the actual decrease $1,550 million.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - Acquisition termination cost represented 5.0% of net revenue in fiscal year 2023, and its absence contributed to the drop in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue from 41.3% to 18.6%.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The removal of the one-time $1,353 million acquisition termination cost from fiscal year 2023 to 2024 significantly reduced the total operating expense burden, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of net revenue, by 22.7 percentage points."

      "answer": "NVIDIA's Gaming segment revenue grew by 9% in FY2025, while total company revenue increased by 114% to $130.5 billion. This indicates that Gaming contributed a relatively small portion to the overall revenue growth, which was primarily driven by the Data Center segment's 142% growth from demand for the Hopper architecture platform.",

These  platforms  incorporate  processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and A utomotive.\n\nRevenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.\n\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by demand for our Hopper architecture accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX  40 Series GPUs.\n\nProfessional V isualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of A da RTX  GPU workstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\n\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\n\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and engineering development, compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  or  U.S.  GA A P .  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV , Item 15 of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\n## Inventories\n\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory , and for excess product purchase commitments. M ost of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  ('GAAP'),  and  growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud  services  metrics  and  changes  to  align  with  how  we  manage  our  Windows  OEM  and  Search  and  news  advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&amp;A.",

      "answer": "The Credit Loss Allowance - Noncurrent started at $47 million in 2021 and ended at $27 million in 2023, resulting in a net decrease of $20 million. This change is explained by a series of adjustments: in 2021, there were deductions of $21 million and a negligible foreign currency adjustment of $(2) million, reducing the balance to $25 million. In 2022, additions of $6 million were offset by a foreign currency adjustment of $(2) million, maintaining the balance at $28 million. Finally, in 2023, deductions of $2 million directly reduced the balance to $27 million.",

        "Step 5: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2023, deductions of $2 million reduced the balance from $28 million to $27 million.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - Combining these changes over the three-year period, the allowance decreased from $47 million to $27 million, a net decrease of $20 million."

      "question": "How was Texas Instruments' 2023 investment allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care benefits structured in terms of fixed income and cash equivalents, and how did this relate to the net periodic benefit credit for the same category?",
      "answer": "Texas Instruments allocated 75% to 85% of its investments for U.S. Retiree Health Care benefits to fixed income securities and cash equivalents in 2023. During the same year, the company recorded a net periodic benefit credit of $7 million for U.S. Retiree Health Care. This indicates that the conservative investment strategy, focused heavily on fixed income and cash, contributed to or supported the credit position for this benefit category.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the net periodic benefit credit for U.S. Retiree Health Care in 2023: $7 million credit.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract the investment allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care benefits: 75% to 85% in fixed income securities and cash equivalents.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the relationship: The conservative investment strategy aligns with managing a benefit credit position, suggesting financial stability in this category."

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized and adjusted the valuation of the Non-Arriver businesses by $229 million and recorded an offsetting adjustment to decrease goodwill for this amount. The Non-Arriver businesses' assets are not available to be used to settle our obligations, and the Non-Arriver businesses' creditors do not have recourse to us. SSW Partners owns and operates the Non-Arriver businesses, and its funding of the purchase price for Veoneer was recorded as a component of held for sale liabilities. The underlying classes of assets and liabilities held for sale have not been presented because such amounts are not material.\n\nGoodwill related to this transaction was allocated to our QCT segment, and $471 million of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and certain synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Completed technology-based intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average useful life of nine years. IPR&amp;D relates to a single project that is expected to be completed in fiscal 2025. Upon completion, we expect the IPR&amp;D to be amortized over its useful life of seven years. We valued the completed technology and IPR&amp;D using an income approach based on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nSince the Closing Date, the operating results of the Arriver and Non-Arriver businesses were initially reported on a one quarter lag. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag previously used to consolidate the Arriver business to provide contemporaneous reporting within our consolidated financial statements, which we believe is preferable. The effect of this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of eliminating the one quarter reporting lag has been included in our operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Non-Arriver businesses are presented as discontinued operations and remain on a one quarter reporting lag.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized and adjusted the valuation of the Non-Arriver businesses by $229 million and recorded an offsetting adjustment to decrease goodwill for this amount. The Non-Arriver businesses' assets are not available to be used to settle our obligations, and the Non-Arriver businesses' creditors do not have recourse to us. SSW Partners owns and operates the Non-Arriver businesses, and its funding of the purchase price for Veoneer was recorded as a component of held for sale liabilities. The underlying classes of assets and liabilities held for sale have not been presented because such amounts are not material.\n\nGoodwill related to this transaction was allocated to our QCT segment, and $471 million of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and certain synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Completed technology-based intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average useful life of nine years. IPR&amp;D relates to a single project that is expected to be completed in fiscal 2025. Upon completion, we expect the IPR&amp;D to be amortized over its useful life of seven years. We valued the completed technology and IPR&amp;D using an income approach based on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nSince the Closing Date, the operating results of the Arriver and Non-Arriver businesses were initially reported on a one quarter lag. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag previously used to consolidate the Arriver business to provide contemporaneous reporting within our consolidated financial statements, which we believe is preferable. The effect of this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of eliminating the one quarter reporting lag has been included in our operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Non-Arriver businesses are presented as discontinued operations and remain on a one quarter reporting lag. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations. The cash flows generated from (used by) the Non-Arriver businesses are reflected as discontinued operations and are classified as operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Investing and financing activities from discontinued operations reported in fiscal 2022 were not material.\n\nOther. During fiscal 2022, we acquired eight other businesses for a total accounting purchase price of $792 million. We recognized $202 million of intangible assets (which primarily relate to completed technology) that will be amortized on a straightline basis over a weighted-average useful life of six years. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized in these transactions of $598 million was allocated to our QCT segment.",

      "answer": "The $308 million increase in estimated QTL licensing revenues per unit was offset by a $299 million decrease in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, resulting in a flat QTL licensing revenue overall.

However, in 2021, DCG revenue decreased by 1% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment.

We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment and saw improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NSG, partially offset by weaker core mix and higher demand in IOTG platform products due to COVID-19. Our CCG revenue was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses.",

We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion in R&amp;D, made capital investments of $18.7 billion, and generated $30.0 billion in cash from operations and $11.3 billion of free cash flow. 1\n\n\"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.

We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

          "chunk_text": "Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021.\n\nSome cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.\n\n## Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\n\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\n- changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n- the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n- changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n- adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n- increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n- changes in available tax credits;\n- changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n- changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n- changes in accounting standards; and\n- our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\n\n## We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\n\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.",

Our \"all other\" revenue increased primarily due to $584 million from a prepaid customer supply agreement settled in Q1 2021 for which we recognized related revenue for completing performance.\n\nWe saw impacts from ongoing industry component, substrate, and foundry silicon shortages across a majority of our businesses and we expect these constraints to continue.\n\n## 2020 vs. 2019\n\nIn 2020, revenue was $77.9 billion, up $5.9 billion, or 8%, from 2019. Our DCG revenue grew 11% due to increased platform volume as cloud service providers increased capacity to serve customer demand. We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment and saw improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NSG, partially offset by weaker core mix and higher demand in IOTG platform products due to COVID-19. Our CCG revenue was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses.",

      "answer": "The cumulative change in IBM's revenue-based provisions from 2022 ($424) to 2024 ($298) was a decrease of $126. This reflects that total additions ($348 in 2024) were significantly lower compared to earlier years ($500 in 2023 and $620 in 2022), while write-offs remained relatively high ($480 in 2024 compared to $456 in 2023 and $629 in 2022).

      "answer": "IBM's Allowance for Inventory Losses decreased by $81 million from the beginning to the end of 2024. The beginning balance was $658 million, and the ending balance was $577 million. This change was influenced by additions of $122 million and write-offs of $199 million, which resulted in a net reduction of $77 million from these two components alone.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The beginning balance of the Allowance for Inventory Losses in 2024 was $658 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The ending balance of the Allowance for Inventory Losses in 2024 was $577 million, and the additions were $122 million while write-offs were $199 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the overall change - $658 million (beginning) - $577 million (ending) = $81 million decrease.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the net impact of additions and write-offs - $122 million (additions) - $199 million (write-offs) = -$77 million net reduction."

      "answer": "From 2019 to 2021, Texas Instruments experienced an increase in diluted shares and a corresponding decrease in diluted EPS, influenced by the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation. In 2019, the basic EPS was $5.33 with 936 million diluted shares, resulting in a diluted EPS of $5.24\u2014a reduction of $0.09 due to the dilutive effect of stock compensation plans. By 2020, basic EPS increased to $6.05 with 933 million diluted shares, leading to a diluted EPS of $5.97\u2014a $0.08 decrease due to dilution. In 2021, basic EPS rose further to $8.38 with 936 million diluted shares, yielding a diluted EPS of $8.26\u2014a $0.12 dilutive impact. Stock-based compensation consistently contributed to the increase in diluted shares, which slightly reduced EPS each year despite rising net income and basic EPS.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize how the increase in diluted shares due to stock compensation affected EPS trends over time."

      "question": "What was the change in underfunded retirement plans from 2020 to 2021, and how did this specific change impact the total liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for those years?",
      "answer": "The underfunded retirement plans decreased from $131 million in 2020 to $79 million in 2021, reflecting an improvement of $52 million. Despite this reduction, the total liabilities increased from $10,164 million in 2020 to $11,343 million in 2021. This indicates that while the decrease in underfunded retirement plans positively impacted liabilities by reducing them by $52 million, other factors contributed to an overall increase in total liabilities by $1,179 million.",

        "Step 1: Extract the values for underfunded retirement plans from evidence_source_a - $131 million in 2020 and $79 million in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the change in underfunded retirement plans - $131 million (2020) minus $79 million (2021) equals a $52 million reduction.",

      "question": "What is the significance of rebalancing plan investments relative to the target allocation ranges, and how do the expected long-term returns assumptions incorporate these ranges?",
      "answer": "The company rebalances its defined benefit plans' investments when they deviate from the target allocation ranges to maintain an appropriate risk-return profile aligned with long-term obligations. These target allocation ranges directly influence the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, as the assumptions factor in future expectations for returns by asset class and the impact of periodic rebalancing to those target ranges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The company rebalances the plans' investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a proactive strategy to maintain desired asset mixes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The expected long-term rate of return assumptions are based on anticipated returns for each asset class and the effect of rebalancing to the target allocation ranges, showing that these ranges are integral to financial forecasting.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The rebalancing ensures that the asset allocation remains consistent with the target ranges, which in turn supports the validity of the long-term return assumptions used for financial planning and reporting."

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax  opinions  from  that  date  forward.  The  recovery  amount  was  calculated  to  be  \u20ac13.1  billion,  plus  interest  of  \u20ac1.2  billion.  The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'General Court'). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\n\nOn an annual basis, the  Company may request approval from the Irish Minister  for  Finance  to  reduce  the  recovery  amount  for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding interest.

These gains were derived from royalty income and milestone achievements associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, AMD's joint venture with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AMD's licensing gain in 2023 was $34 million and in 2022 was $102 million.",

        "Step 3: The decrease is calculated as $102 million (2022) - $34 million (2023) = $68 million."

      "answer": "Apple's fixed lease costs for operating leases in 2023 were $2.0 billion, while the actual fixed cash payments made were $1.9 billion, resulting in a $0.1 billion difference. This indicates that not all fixed lease costs are immediately paid in cash during the reporting period, as some amounts may be accrued or deferred under accounting standards like ASC 842, which requires operating leases to be recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, even if the cash payments occur in different periods.",

Specifically, restructuring charges decreased by $91 million, or 61%, in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior year. This decline was a key factor in the 18% overall decrease in unallocated expenses. Based on the 2021 unallocated expenses of approximately $509 million (inferred from the 18% decrease leading to a 2022 level of about $417 million), the restructuring-related reduction represented nearly half of the total decline in unallocated expenses.",

Operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products.\n\nUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; restructuring, impairment and disposal charges; acquisition-related costs; and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses decreased 18% in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.\n\n## Non-Operating Income and Expenses\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $1,737 million and $1,885 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower losses on extinguishment of debt. We expect to incur additional interest expense in future periods as a result of indebtedness associated with the pending VMware Merger.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items. Other expense, net, was $54 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to other income, net, of $131 million for fiscal year 2021. The change was primarily due to changes in investment gains or losses.\n\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $939 million and $29 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of October 30, 2022 consisted of: (i) $12,416 million in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit",

Net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and FC SAN products.\n\n## Gross Margin\n\nGross margin was $22,095 million, or 67% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2022, compared to $16,844 million, or 61% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, mainly from our 2016 acquisition of Broadcom Corporation and, to a lesser extent, favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions segment.\n\n## Research and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased $65 million, or 1%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense and engineering project costs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense reflecting the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effects of forfeitures.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $35 million, or 3%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense, offset in part by lower stock-based compensation expense.\n\n## Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased $464 million, or 23%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets from our acquisition of CA, Inc.\n\n## Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal Charges\n\nRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges recognized in operating expenses decreased $91 million, or 61%, in fiscal year 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee termination costs following the completion of key restructuring activities from acquisitions.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $1,533 million and $1,704 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease primarily reflects the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effect of forfeitures.\n\nThe following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards outstanding and expected to vest as of October 30, 2022, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weightedaverage service period of 2.7 years.",
