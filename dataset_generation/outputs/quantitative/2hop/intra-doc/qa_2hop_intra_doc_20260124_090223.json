          "chunk_text": "\nWe have varying stages of exploration, development and production activities across approx imately 2.7 million net acres in Malaysia, with working interests in six PSCs.  Four of these PSCs are located in waters off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G, Block J, the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC), which we do not operate, and Block SB405, an operated exploration block acquired in 2021.  We also operate another two exploration blocks, Block WL4-00 and Block SK304, in waters off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak.\n\n## Block J\n\n## Gumusut\n\nWe currently have a 29.5 percent working interest in the unitized Gumusut Field.  Gumusut Phase 2 first oil was achieved in 2019.  Development drilling associated with Gumusut Phase 3, a four-well program, is planned to commence in the first quarter of 2022.  First oil is anticipated in 2022.\n\n## KBBC\n\nThe KBBC PSC grants us a 30 percent working interest in the KBB, Kamunsu East and Kamunsu East Upthrown Canyon gas and condensate fields.  In 2020, we recognized dry hole expense and impaired the associated carrying value of unproved properties in the Kamunsu East Field that is no longer in our development plans.\n\n## KBB\n\nDuring 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating LNG vessel which provided increased gas offtake capacity. Production from the field has been reduced since Janu  ary 2020, due to the rupture of a third-party pipeline which carries gas production from KBB to one of its markets.  The pipeline operator has initiated repairs and is working toward pipeline testing during 2022.\n\n## Block G\n\n## Malikai\n\nWe hold a 35 percent working interest in Malikai.  This field achieved first production in December 2016 via the Malikai Tension Leg Platform, ramping to peak production in 2018.  The KMU-1 exploration well was completed and started producing through the Malikai platform in 2018.  Malikai Phase 2 development first oil was achieved in February 2021.\n\n## Siakap North-Petai\n\nWe hold a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil field.  First oil from SNP Phase 2 was achieved in November 2021.\n\n## Exploration\n\nIn 2017, we were awarded operatorship and a 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00, which included the existing Salam-1 oil discovery and encompassed 0.6 million gross acres.  In 2018 and 2019, two exploration and two appraisal wells were drilled, resulting in oil discoveries under evaluation at Salam and Benum, while two Patawali wells were expensed as dry holes in 2019.  Further exploration and appraisal drilling is planned for 2022.\n\nIn 2018, we were awarded a 50 percent working interest and operatorship of Block SK304 encompassing 2.1 million gross acres off the coast of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia.  We acquired 3D seismic over the acreage and completed processing of this data in 2019.  Exploration drilling is planned for 2022.",

      "answer": "The equity affiliate revenues from the Asia Pacific/Middle East region decreased by 10.9% from $2,859 million in 2019 to $2,547 million in 2021. During the same period, total equity affiliate revenues across all regions decreased by 11.3% from $2,859 million in 2019 (entirely from Asia Pacific/Middle East) to $2,547 million in 2021 (also entirely from Asia Pacific/Middle East). Therefore, the regional change in Asia Pacific/Middle East mirrored the overall change in total equity affiliate revenues.",

        "Step 4: Calculate percentage decrease in total equity affiliate revenues: ((2,859 - 2,547) / 2,859) * 100 = 10.9%, showing the change in Asia Pacific/Middle East equates to the total change.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Since all equity affiliate revenues in both years came exclusively from the Asia Pacific/Middle East region, the regional change directly explains the total change in equity affiliate revenues."

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips uses derivative instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options to manage commodity price risk and optimize marketing activities. According to the VaR model using Monte Carlo simulation at a 95% confidence level, the potential loss in fair value from adverse market changes for these instruments was immaterial to consolidated cash flows and net income in 2021. This conclusion is supported by the audited consolidated financial statements, which were confirmed to fairly present the company's financial position and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, indicating that the risk exposure from derivatives did not materially affect the reported cash flows.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The consolidated financial statements, including consolidated cash flows, were audited and found to fairly present the financial position and results of operations in accordance with GAAP.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The audit opinion confirms the reliability of the financial statements, which include the impact (or lack thereof) of derivative instruments. Therefore, the stated immaterial impact of VaR on cash flows is validated by the audit, showing how derivative risk management aligns with financial reporting integrity."

In our opinion,  the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,  providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts  or disclosures to which they relate.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n## Financial Instrument Market Risk\n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.  We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related  products; fluctuations in interest  rates and foreign currency  exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.\n\nOur use of derivative instruments is governed by an 'Authority Limitations' document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits  the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity.  The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily.  The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nOur Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n- Meet customer needs.  Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.\n- Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums.  We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.\n\nWe use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, as derivative instruments.  Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates.  The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date.  The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value.  A hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our floating-rate debt.  The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data. Changes to prevailing interest rates would not impact our cash flows associated with fixed rate debt, unless we elect to repurchase or retire such  debt prior to maturity.",

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures.

      "answer": "Chevron's effective discount rates for its U.S. pension and OPEB plans increased from 2.4% in 2020 to 2.8% in 2021, following a prior rate of 3.1% in 2019. This fluctuation indicates that the company adjusted its assumptions based on changes in the yield curve and bond market conditions, which directly influence how future benefit payments are discounted to present value. A lower discount rate in 2020 implies higher present value of future obligations compared to 2019, while the increase in 2021 suggests a partial reversal. This trend reflects Chevron\u2019s dynamic approach to pension liability valuation in response to macroeconomic shifts.",

This impacts the present value of future obligations and informs analysts about how Chevron adjusts its long-term liability estimates in response to financial market conditions."

      "question": "How did the change in Chevron's (CVX) average crude oil sales price per barrel from 2020 to 2021 in Africa compare to the change in its average production costs per barrel in the same region, and what was the resulting impact on gross margin per barrel?",
      "answer": "Chevron's average crude oil sales price in Africa increased from $38.89 per barrel in 2020 to $72.38 per barrel in 2021, a rise of $33.49. Over the same period, its average production costs in Africa increased from $13.19 per barrel to $12.40 per barrel, a decrease of $0.79. As a result, the gross margin per barrel in Africa rose by $34.28, from $25.70 in 2020 to $60. (Calculation: 2020 gross margin = $38.89 - $13.19 = $25.70; 2021 gross margin = $72.38 - $12.40 = $59.98; difference = $59.98 - $25.70 = $34.28).",

        "Step 5: Calculate the change in sales price: $72.38 - $38.89 = $33.49.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the change in production costs: $12.40 - $13.19 = -$0.79 (a decrease).",

        "Step 10: Synthesize - The significant increase in crude oil prices outpaced the slight reduction in production costs, leading to a substantial increase in gross margin per barrel in Africa."

      "answer": "Chevron's total exploration costs decreased by 21.8% from $873 million in 2020 to $682 million in 2021. This reduction was driven by a $125 million drop in 'Wells' costs (from $381 million to $256 million) and a $2 million decrease in 'Geological and geophysical' costs (from $185 million to $187 million).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron's total exploration costs in 2020 were $873 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron's total exploration costs in 2021 were $682 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage decrease in total exploration costs: ((873 - 682) / 873) * 100 = 21.8%.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron's 'Wells' exploration costs in 2020 were $381 million and 'Geological and geophysical' costs were $185 million.",
        "Step 5: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron's 'Wells' exploration costs in 2021 were $256 million and 'Geological and geophysical' costs were $187 million.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the change in 'Wells' costs: 381 - 256 = $125 million decrease.",
        "Step 7: Calculate the change in 'Geological and geophysical' costs: 185 - 187 = $2 million increase (i.e., slight cost increase in this category).",
        "Step 8: Synthesize - The overall decrease in exploration costs was primarily driven by reductions in 'Wells' costs, while 'Geological and geophysical' costs slightly increased."

      "answer": "The decrease in exploration expenses in 2021, from $770 million in 2020 to $549 million in 2021, contributed to an improvement in Chevron's results before income taxes. This $221 million reduction in exploration costs was part of broader cost savings that helped Chevron achieve a results before income taxes of $4,735 million in 2021, compared to a much lower figure in 2020, which was impacted by impairments and write-offs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Exploration expense in 2021 was $549 million, down from $770 million in 2020, due to lower charges for well write-offs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron's results before income taxes in 2021 were $4,735 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $221 million decrease in exploration expenses from 2020 to 2021 contributed to the improved pre-tax results, as lower exploration costs reduced overall operating expenses."

      "answer": "The total 'Taxes other than on income' for Chevron's Consolidated Companies increased by $498 million from 2020 to 2021, rising from $870 million in 2020 to $1,368 million in 2021. During the same period, 'Production expenses excluding taxes' remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $9,460 million in 2020 to $9,484 million in 2021, a negligible change of -$24 million. This indicates that while non-income tax expenses rose significantly year-over-year, production costs excluding taxes were largely unchanged.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Chevron reported a 190 million barrel increase in U.S. natural gas liquids proved reserves due to extensions and discoveries, and an additional 107 million barrel increase driven by higher commodity prices and increased development activity. This resulted in a total increase of 297 million barrels from these two factors. In the same year, PSC-related reserves accounted for 7% of Chevron\u2019s consolidated reserves. The combined quantitative impact of these reserve additions highlights the influence of market conditions and exploration activity on Chevron's reserve growth.",

      "question": "How much higher is the 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Chevron's consolidated companies compared to its affiliated companies, and what is the primary reason for this difference according to the methodology described?",
      "answer": "The 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Chevron's consolidated companies is $103,884 million, while for affiliated companies it is $25, (i.e., $21,942 million for TCO and $3,049 million for Other affiliated companies). This results in a difference of $78,884 million. The primary reason for this difference is the larger future cash inflows from production in the consolidated companies ($26,926 million for Europe and $48,067 million for Consolidated Companies excluding Europe) compared to affiliated companies, despite both being subjected to the same 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Identify the 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Consolidated Companies ($103,884 million) and Affiliated Companies ($21,942 million for TCO + $3,049 million for Other = $24,991 million).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Understand the methodology for calculating the Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows, which includes future cash inflows, production costs, development costs, income taxes, and a 10 percent midyear annual discount.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference between consolidated and affiliated companies: $103,884 million - $24,991 million = $78,893 million.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the breakdown of future cash inflows from production in evidence_source_a to determine the primary cause of the difference, which is the significantly higher inflows in consolidated companies."

This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs  for  asset  retirement  obligations  (includes  costs  to  retire  existing  wells  and  facilities  in  addition  to  those  future  wells  and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future  development  and  production  costs.  The  calculations  are  made  as  of  December  31  each  year  and  do  not  represent management's estimate of the company's future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption 'Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows' refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.\n\n",

      "answer": "Note 22, titled 'Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation,' outlines Chevron's practices for recognizing compensation expense related to equity and liability awards. For equity awards like stock options, Chevron recognizes compensation expense based on the grant date fair value, while for liability awards like stock appreciation rights, it uses the settlement value. The company recognizes this expense over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time until an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. For LTIP awards with graded vesting, one-third of each award vests annually, and Chevron amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Note 22 is titled 'Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation' and is listed on page 32, indicating its importance in Chevron's financial disclosures.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron recognizes compensation expense for equity awards (e.g., stock options) based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards (e.g., stock appreciation rights) based on the settlement value.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Under the LTIP, awards such as stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting provisions, with one-third of each award vesting annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The significance of Note 22 lies in its detailed explanation of Chevron's accounting methodology for share-based compensation, particularly how the company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights under the LTIP, using straight-line amortization over the vesting period."

          "chunk_text": "reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.\n\nGoodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.\n\nEnvironmental  Expenditures Environmental  expenditures  that  relate  to  ongoing  operations  or  to  conditions  caused  by  past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.\n\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance  with  accounting  standards  for  asset  retirement  and  environmental  obligations.  Refer  to  Note  25  Asset  Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company's AROs.\n\nFor U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable  and  estimable  costs,  and  probable  amounts  for  other  potentially  responsible  parties  when  mandated  by  the  regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on  the  company's  best  estimate  of  future  costs  using  currently  available  technology  and  applying  current  regulations  and  the company's own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.\n\nCurrency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company's consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in 'Currency translation adjustment' on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.\n\nRevenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.\n\nRevenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company's commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company's contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company's estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nDiscounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products,  an  observable  standalone  selling  price  is  generally  used  to  measure  revenue  for  each  product. The  company  includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.\n\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability  awards,  such  as  stock  appreciation  rights,  total  compensation  cost  is  based  on  the  settlement  value.  The  company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company's Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by  which  one-third  of  each  award  vests  on  each  of  the  first,  second  and  third  anniversaries  of  the  date  of  grant.  In  addition, performance  shares  granted  under  the  company's  LTIP  will  vest  at  the  end  of  the  three-year  performance  period.  For  awards granted under the company's LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.",

      "question": "What was the net change in Chevron's (CVX) natural gas liquids proved reserves in the United States from 2019 to 2021, and how did revisions and extensions/discoveries contribute differently to this change?",
      "answer": "The net change in Chevron's natural gas liquids proved reserves in the United States from 2019 to 2021 was an increase of 186 million barrels. Revisions contributed a net increase of 66 million barrels (from a -120 million barrel decrease in 2019, -71 million in 2020, and +107 million in 2021), while extensions and discoveries contributed a total increase of 390 million barrels (140 million in 2019, 60 million in 2020, and 190 million in 2021).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The revisions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 were -120 million, -71 million, and +107 million barrels, respectively.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The extensions and discoveries for 2019, 2020, and 2021 were +140 million, +60 million, and +190 million barrels, respectively.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Sum the revisions over the three years to get a net revision impact (-120 - 71 + 107 = -84 million barrels). Sum the extensions and discoveries (+140 + 60 + 190 = +390 million barrels). The net change is the sum of these two components (-84 + 390 = +306 million barrels). However, since the question compares 2019 to 2021 reserves directly and the ending reserve balances show a net increase of 186 million barrels, this reflects the overall net impact after all factors including purchases and divestitures."

      "question": "How did the 2022 valuation of unproved properties in the U.S. and Other Americas regions, as disclosed in CVX's 10-K filing, contribute to the overall financial performance of producing operations in those regions in 2022, based on the results before income taxes?",
      "answer": "The 2022 valuation of unproved properties in the U.S. and Other Americas was $289 million and $1,536 million, respectively. These valuations were expensed under 'Unproved properties valuation' in the income statement, which directly reduced the results before income taxes for those regions. In 2022, the results before income taxes for the U.S. and Other Americas were $(6,322) million and $(308) million, respectively. The expensing of unproved properties contributed significantly to the U.S. result, worsening the pre-tax outcome, while the impact in Other Americas was relatively smaller but still negative. This shows that high unproved property valuations in these regions directly influenced the financial performance by reducing pre-tax earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 2022 unproved properties valuation for U.S. is $289 million and for Other Americas is $1,536 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 2022 results before income taxes for U.S. is $(6,322) million and for Other Americas is $(308) million.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the financial impact - The unproved properties valuation is an expense item under 'Unproved properties valuation' in the income statement, which reduces pre-tax results.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The significant unproved properties valuation expense in the U.S. ($289 million) contributed to the large negative pre-tax result of $(6,322) million, while the much higher valuation expense in Other Americas ($1,536 million) had a proportionally smaller impact on its pre-tax result of $(308) million, indicating differing underlying profitability or revenue generation in those regions."

On a consolidated global basis, the Results of Producing Operations fell from $26,739 million in 2022 to $17,617 million in 2024, a total decrease of $9,122 million.

      "answer": "Chevron\u2019s total Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Consolidated and Affiliated Companies decreased from $145,008 million in 2023 to $119,940 million in 2024, a decline of $25,068 million. This was partly driven by a drop in future cash inflows from production in the U.S. from $181,152 million in 2023 to $163,846 million in 2024 (a decrease of $17,306 million) and in Asia from $62,094 million in 2023 to $58,245 million in 2024 (a decrease of $3,849 million).

This includes using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities  in  addition  to  those  future  wells  and  facilities  necessary  to  produce  proved  undeveloped  reserves),  and  estimated  future  income  tax es  based  on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs, which could change over time as new information becomes available. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management's estimate of the company's future cash flows  or  value  of  its  oil  and  gas  reserves.  In  the  following  table,  the  caption  'Standardized  Measure  Net  Cash  Flows'  refers  to  the  standardized  measure  of discounted future net cash flows.\n\n",

Over the same period, the number of projects with exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year increased from 12 to 14, indicating a growing number of long-term exploration initiatives.

      "answer": "The percentage change in Chevron's 'Results before income taxes' for the Asia region increased from $3,152 million in 2023 to $3,120 million in 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 1.0%. In contrast, the 'Results before income taxes' for the TCO affiliated company decreased from $4,684 million in 2023 to $4,120 million in 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 12.0%. This indicates that the TCO affiliated company experienced a significantly larger decline in pre-tax results compared to the Asia region.",

No impairments of these investments were reported in either year because the company did not identify any material impairments requiring measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during 2023 or 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Investments and advances' were $47,438 million in 2024 and $46,812 million in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in Investments and Advances is calculated using the values from 2023 and 2024, and the absence of impairments is directly stated in the second source, forming a complete answer."

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.\n\nInvestments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023.\n\nThe tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\n",

      "question": "How did Chevron's (CVX) impairment of U.S. upstream assets in 2023, driven by regulatory challenges in California, influence its 2024 assessment of Properties, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) for impairment, particularly in terms of management's assumptions and sensitivity to future regulatory changes?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 2023 impairment of U.S. upstream assets in California due to regulatory challenges signaled a high sensitivity to external regulatory pressures, which directly influenced its 2024 impairment assessments of Properties, Plant and Equipment (PP&E). In 2024, Chevron emphasized that changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations could trigger new impairment reviews, especially for upstream assets. This shows a causal mechanism where the prior impairment experience in California heightened management\u2019s awareness and responsiveness to regulatory developments, leading to a more cautious and anticipatory impairment review process in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron assesses PP&E for impairment when events like changes in environmental regulations occur, and impairments may result from regulatory changes that impede oil and gas development.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023, Chevron impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges that reduced anticipated future investment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 2023 impairment experience in California directly shaped Chevron\u2019s 2024 impairment review process by reinforcing the material impact of regulatory changes on asset recoverability, leading to explicit acknowledgment of regulatory risk as a trigger for future impairment assessments."

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,  given  the  broad  range  of  the  company's  PP&amp;E  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.",

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis.

      "answer": "Chevron's decision not to record any individually material impairments of long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 2024 directly aligns with its detailed reporting on Properties, Plant and Equipment in its financial statements. This lack of impairments indicates that the company did not identify significant declines in asset values that would require write-downs during the year, suggesting stability in the carrying value of its long-term assets. This stability supports the consistency of the information presented in Note 18, which focuses on Properties, Plant and Equipment, and implies that no major adjustments were needed for asset valuations during 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Note 18 is specifically titled 'Properties, Plant and Equipment' and appears in the list of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 35.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron explicitly states that it did not have any individually material impairments of long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The absence of material impairments in 2024 directly connects to the detailed reporting on Properties, Plant and Equipment, as it indicates no significant asset value declines requiring adjustments, supporting the consistency and reliability of the reported asset values in the financial statements."

      "question": "How did Chevron's portfolio optimization and reservoir performance in the Delaware Basin impact its U.S. NGL proved reserves in 2023, and what was the combined effect of these revisions and acquisitions on total U.S. reserves in that year?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron experienced a decrease of 49 million barrels in U.S. NGL proved reserves due to portfolio optimization and a decrease of 29 million barrels due to reservoir performance in the Delaware Basin, totaling a 78 million barrel reduction. However, the acquisition of PDC in the Delaware and DJ basins added 262 million barrels to U.S. reserves. Therefore, despite the revisions, the net effect was an overall increase of 184 million barrels (262M - 78M = 184M) in U.S. NGL proved reserves from acquisitions after accounting for the negative impacts in the Delaware Basin.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2023, the U.S. NGL proved reserves decreased by 110 million barrels, with 49 million barrels attributed to portfolio optimization and 29 million barrels to reservoir performance in the Delaware Basin.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023, Chevron\u2019s acquisition of PDC in the Delaware and DJ basins contributed a 262 million barrel increase in U.S. NGL proved reserves.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The total negative impact from the Delaware Basin was 78 million barrels (49M + 29M). This was offset by the 262 million barrel increase from the PDC acquisition, resulting in a net positive impact of 184 million barrels on U.S. reserves in 2023."

The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting - three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.\n\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.",

This $345 million increase in Properties, Plant and Equipment likely reflects Chevron's continued investment in long-lived assets, which in turn increases deferred tax liabilities as these assets are depreciated over time. The absence of material impairments in 2024 (contrasted with upstream asset impairments in 2023 due to regulatory challenges in California) suggests a more stable asset management strategy in 2024.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron did not report any material impairments of long-lived assets in 2024, unlike 2023 when upstream assets in California were impaired due to regulatory challenges.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in Properties, Plant and Equipment directly contributed to higher deferred tax liabilities. The lack of impairments in 2024 compared to 2023 indicates a more stable asset base and investment strategy."

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.\n\nInvestments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023.\n\nThe tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\n",

      "question": "How did Chevron's commodity-related sales and other income activities contribute to its overall financial performance in 2024, and what does this indicate about its exposure to commodity market volatility?",
      "answer": "Chevron's commodity-related activities in 2024 resulted in a net loss of $23 million, combining a $57 million loss in sales and other operating revenues, a $28 million gain in purchased crude oil and products, and a $6 million gain in other income. This indicates that Chevron's financial performance remained sensitive to commodity price fluctuations, particularly in its core sales and crude oil procurement segments, which can impact profitability during volatile market conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The total net loss from commodity-related activities in 2024 was $23 million, derived from three classifications: Sales and other operating revenues ($57M loss), Purchased crude oil and products ($28M gain), and Other income (loss) ($6M gain).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The breakdown of commodity contract impacts across multiple income classifications confirms the volatility associated with Chevron's exposure to commodity markets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combining the specific figures from both sources reveals the net financial impact of Chevron's commodity activities and highlights the ongoing exposure to market price swings, which affects strategic risk management and earnings stability."

          "chunk_text": "Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2024, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held  in  the  trust  as  instructed  by  the  trust's  beneficiaries.  The  shares  held  in  the  trust  are  not  considered  outstanding  for  earnings-per-share  purposes  until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.\n\nEmployee  Incentive  Plans The  Chevron  Incentive  Plan  is  an  annual  cash  bonus  plan  for  eligible  employees  that  links  awards  to  corporate  and  individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $965, $809 and $1,169 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Chevron also has the L TIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the L TIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 22 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation.\n\n## Note 24\n\n## Other Contingencies and Commitments\n\nIncome Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual  tax ing  authorities  until  several  years  after  the  end  of  the  annual  period  for  which  income  tax es  have  been  calculated.  Refer  to Note  17  Tax es  for  a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company's major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\n\nSettlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future ex amination.\n\nGuarantees The company has one guarantee to an equity affiliate totaling $98. This guarantee is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for this guarantee.\n\nIndemnifications The company often includes standard indemnification provisions in its arrangements with its partners, suppliers and vendors in the ordinary course of business, the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited. The company may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with its service or other claims made against such parties.\n\nLong-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers' financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company's business. The aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and takeor-pay agreements are: 2025 - $1,039; 2026 - $1,129; 2027 - $1,304; 2028 - $1,326; 2029 - $1,236; after 2029 - $6,882. The aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are: 2025 - $436; 2026 - $653; 2027 - $477; 2028 - $380; 2029 - $186; after 2029 - $907. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were $1,354 in 2024, $1,420 in 2023 and $1,866 in 2022.\n\nEnvironmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields and mining sites.",

      "answer": "Chevron pays its share of income taxes directly for certain equity affiliates, and as a result, these taxes are not included in the equity in earnings figure. Instead, they are reported separately on the Consolidated Statement of Income as 'Income tax expense.' This implies that while Chevron's share of the affiliates' pre-tax earnings is reflected in equity in earnings, the actual tax burden associated with those earnings is managed and reported independently, affecting the overall net income after tax.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that Chevron pays its share of income taxes directly for certain equity affiliates, and these taxes are not included in equity in earnings but are instead reported as 'Income tax expense.'",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we understand that Chevron reports fair value measurements, including for investments and advances, but did not have any material impairments in 2024, indicating the investments remain active and relevant to ongoing earnings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The direct payment of taxes by Chevron affects how equity earnings are presented, as the earnings figure is pre-tax. This has implications for understanding the full cost of these investments when analyzing net profitability."

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.\n\nInvestments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023.\n\nThe tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\n",

Over this period, the cumulative additions to deferred income tax expense were $1,881 million (2024) + $2,348 million (2023) + $3,533 million (2022) = $7,762 million.

      "question": "How does Chevron's acquisition of greenhouse gas assessment permits, including Blocks G-18-AP and G-20-AP in 2024, and its compliance activities in carbon abatement projects like the one that eliminated over 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, cumulatively support its strategic positioning in carbon capture and storage capabilities?",
      "answer": "Chevron's acquisition of greenhouse gas assessment permits, including Blocks G-18-AP and G-20-AP in 2024, expands its exploration and evaluation of carbon dioxide storage potential across nearly 10.2 million gross acres, particularly in the Carnarvon and Bonaparte Basins. This strategic land acquisition provides the company with a robust portfolio of potential sites for future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Simultaneously, Chevron's compliance activities, such as the project that abated over 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the U.S., demonstrate its operational capability and commitment to reducing emissions. Together, these actions position Chevron as a leader in developing scalable CCS solutions, aligning with its broader energy transition goals and enhancing its ability to participate in lower-carbon energy markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron holds operated and nonoperated working interests in five greenhouse gas assessment permits, including Blocks G-18-AP and G-20-AP awarded in 2024, covering nearly 10.2 million gross acres.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Chevron completed projects that abated over 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent from its operations in the U.S.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The acquisition of assessment permits expands Chevron's potential for carbon storage, while the compliance-driven abatement projects demonstrate its active implementation of carbon reduction strategies, together reinforcing its strategic positioning in CCS capabilities."
