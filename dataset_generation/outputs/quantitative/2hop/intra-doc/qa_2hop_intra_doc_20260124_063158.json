      "answer": "The unrealized gain on fair value hedges in 2023 was $536 million, contributing directly to Verizon's total comprehensive income of $12,580 million. Over the three-year period from 2021 to 2023, the cumulative reclassifications from unrealized gains (losses) on fair value hedges to net income were $60 million (2022) and $81 million (2023), while no such reclassification was reported in 2021. Therefore, the total cumulative reclassification impact from this component was $141 million.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The unrealized gain on fair value hedges for 2023 is $536 million, contributing to the total comprehensive income of $12,580 million.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine the 2022 and 2023 reclassification amounts to determine the cumulative impact over the three-year period: $60 million + $81 million = $141 million."

However, the segment-level data in Source B only shows the 2022 value and not the 2023 value, so the year-over-year change for the segment cannot be fully calculated from this data. Therefore, the segment-level change must be inferred from the consolidated data.",

      "answer": "The Consolidated Operating Revenues decreased by $2,861 million from $136,835 million in 2022 to $133,974 million in 2023. During the same period, Corporate and Other revenues declined by $31 million, from $2,510 million in 2022 to $2,479 million in 2023. While the decline in Corporate and Other revenues only marginally contributed to the overall drop, the larger decrease in Consolidated Operating Revenues suggests a more significant reduction in revenues from the reportable segments, which fell by $2,830 million (from $134,578 million in 2022 to $131,748 million in 2023).",

Over the same period, the cost of wireless equipment decreased from $30,496 million to $26,786 million, a reduction of $3,710 million. The decrease in wireless equipment revenue was proportionally smaller than the decrease in related operating costs, which may suggest improved cost efficiency in managing wireless equipment expenses relative to sales.",

      "answer": "The total Service and Other Revenues and Wireless Equipment Revenues for Verizon's Business segment increased from $31.1 billion in 2021 ($27.7 billion + $3.4 billion) to $30.1 billion in 2023 ($26.4 billion + $3.7 billion), representing a decrease of $1.0 billion year-over-year. This reflects a shift in performance where service and other revenues declined by $1.3 billion, but wireless equipment revenues increased by $0.3 billion, indicating stronger equipment sales relative to service revenues in 2023 compared to 2021.",

This slight decrease in the share count contributed to a reduction in diluted net income per share from $58.61 in 2020 to $112.20 in 2021, reflecting a significant improvement in per-share value due to both earnings growth and a more favorable share structure.",

      "answer": "The total change in the number of shares used in the per-share computation for Class A shares from 2019 to 2021 under the diluted net income per share calculation is 46,343 shares. This change is primarily driven by the conversion of Class B to Class A shares, which increased from 46,527 shares in 2019 to 45,430 shares in 2021, contributing directly to the overall increase in the diluted share count.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The number of shares used in the per-share computation for Class A shares under diluted net income in 2019 is 346,342.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The number of shares used in the per-share computation for Class A shares under diluted net income in 2021 is 345,755 + 45,430 = 391,185 (basic shares + conversion of Class B to Class A).",
        "Step 3: Calculate the total change - 391,185 (2021) - 346,342 (2019) = 44,843.",
        "Step 4: Extract conversion contribution - In 2019, the conversion of Class B to Class A shares added 46,527 shares; in 2021, this conversion added 45,430 shares.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The overall increase in diluted shares for Class A is largely due to the conversion of Class B shares, despite a slight decrease in the conversion amount between the two years."

      "answer": "The total number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class A shares in 2021 was 345,755. In 2019, the total number of shares used in the computation for Class A shares was 346,342. This indicates a decrease of 587 shares between 2019 and 2021.",

      "question": "How did the changes in the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities for Class A shares between 2020 and 2021 impact the allocation of undistributed earnings per share, and what does this imply about the dilution effect on shareholder value?",
      "answer": "In 2020, the conversion of Class B to Class A shares added 46,182 shares to the denominator for Class A, while in 2021, this figure decreased slightly to 45,430 shares. Additionally, restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares increased from 87 shares in 2020 to 15 shares in 2021 for Class A. As a result, the total number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class A increased from 346,084 shares in 2020 to 345,755 shares in 2021. Despite the slight reduction in converted shares, the overall denominator remained large, which contributed to a minor decrease in diluted net income per share from $58.61 in 2020 to $112.20 in 2021. This implies that while the number of dilutive shares slightly decreased, the overall impact on earnings per share was significant, reflecting a stronger underlying earnings growth.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class A in 2020 was 346,084, including 46,182 shares from the conversion of Class B to Class A and 87 shares from restricted stock units.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - In 2021, the number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class A was 345,755, including 45,430 shares from the conversion of Class B to Class A and 15 shares from restricted stock units.",

      "answer": "The total amount of unrealized state-level tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, is $5.7 billion, combining the $5.0 billion California R&D carryforward and the $700 million investment tax credit carryforward. Since Google believes both of these credits are not likely to be realized, they contribute to the company's decision to maintain a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. This impacts Google's deferred tax asset valuation strategy by necessitating continued reassessment of the allowance, with potential future tax benefits only being recorded if evidence supports a partial or full release of the allowance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Google has $5.0 billion in California R&D carryforwards that are indefinite but not likely to be realized.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Google has $700 million in state investment tax credit carryforwards that begin to expire in 2025 and are also not likely to be realized.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding both amounts gives the total unrealized state-level tax benefits ($5.0B + $700M = $5.7B).",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both credits being unrealized supports the maintenance of a valuation allowance, which affects Google's deferred tax asset strategy by deferring any recognition of tax benefits until realizability is more likely."

      "answer": "The total number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class C shares was 340,944 in 2020 and 331,919 in 2021. In 2020, the inclusion of 6,125 restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares contributed to an increase in the diluted share count compared to the basic share count of 334,819. In 2021, the inclusion of 10,009 such shares contributed to the final diluted share count, up from the basic count of 321,910. The addition of these dilutive securities reduced the earnings per share by increasing the total share count.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - For Class C shares in 2020, the number of shares used in the basic computation was 334,819, and the diluted computation included an additional 6,125 restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares, resulting in 340,944 total diluted shares.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - For Class C shares in 2021, the number of shares used in the basic computation was 321,910, and the diluted computation included an additional 10,009 restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares, resulting in 331,919 total diluted shares.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - By comparing the basic and diluted share counts for Class C shares in both years, we can determine that the inclusion of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares increased the diluted share count in both 2020 and 2021, which in turn affects the diluted net income per share."

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  hav e  also  receiv ed  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting  transfer  pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate gov ernmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believ e it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\n\n## Note 15.

In Google Serv ices, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud serv ices.\n\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activ ities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content prov iders. Other uses of cash from operating activ ities include payments to suppliers for dev ices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activ ities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash receiv ed from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of rev enues and operating expenses.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by inv esting activ ities consists primarily of maturities and sales of inv estments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in  inv esting  activ ities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and  equipment,  and payments for acquisitions.\n\nNet  cash  used  in  inv esting  activ ities  increased  from  2023  to  2024  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities. T he increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driv en by inv estments in technical infrastructure.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activ ities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activ ities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activ ities, payment of div idends, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activ ities  increased  from  2023  to  2024  due  to  div idend  payments  and  net  payments  related  to  stock-based  award activ ities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.",

Other uses of cash from operating activ ities include payments to suppliers for dev ices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activ ities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash receiv ed from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of rev enues and operating expenses.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by inv esting activ ities consists primarily of maturities and sales of inv estments in marketable and non-marketable securities.

T he increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driv en by inv estments in technical infrastructure.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activ ities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activ ities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activ ities, payment of div idends, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet  cash  used  in  financing  activ ities  increased  from  2023  to  2024  due  to  div idend  payments  and  net  payments  related  to  stock-based  award activ ities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.",

      "question": "What is the total increase in Google's Class A, Class B, and Class C Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2024, and how does the combination of stock-based compensation and repurchases of stock over this period contribute to this change?",
      "answer": "The total increase in Google's Class A, Class B, and Class C Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital from December 31, 2021 ($61,774 million) to December 31, 2024 ($84,800 million) is $23,026 million. This increase is primarily driven by cumulative stock-based compensation of $19,525 million in 2022, $22,578 million in 2023, and $22,937 million in 2024, totaling $65,040 million. However, this growth was partially offset by cumulative stock repurchases of $3,404 million in 2022, $4,064 million in 2023, and $3,359 million in 2024, totaling $10,827 million. Therefore, the net contribution from these two factors is $65,040 million (stock-based compensation) - $10,827 million (repurchases) = $54,213 million, which significantly exceeds the overall $23,026 million increase, indicating that other adjustments (e.g., tax withholdings, dividends) also had a downward impact on the capital account.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The amount for Class A, Class B, and Class C Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital was $61,774 million as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The amount for Class A, Class B, and Class C Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital was $84,800 million as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Calculate total increase - $84,800 million - $61,774 million = $23,026 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract stock-based compensation figures from both chunks - $19,525 million (2022), $22,578 million (2023), and $22,937 million (2024), totaling $65,040 million.",
        "Step 5: Extract stock repurchase figures from both chunks - $3,404 million (2022), $4,064 million (2023), and $3,359 million (2024), totaling $10,827 million.",
        "Step 6: Calculate net contribution of stock-based compensation and repurchases - $65,040 million (compensation) - $10,827 million (repurchases) = $54,213 million.",
        "Step 7: Synthesize - The $23,026 million increase in capital is significantly less than the $54,213 million net contribution from stock-based compensation and repurchases, indicating other factors such as tax withholdings and dividends reduced the capital account."

      "answer": "In 2023, Class A share repurchases amounted to $9,316 million, while in 2024, they increased to $11,855 million, reflecting an increase of $2,539 million.

      "answer": "The total cumulative net tax-adjusted reclassification of unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments from AOCI to net income for Google over the years 2022 through 2024 is $2,781 million.

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding these reclassification amounts ($1,007 + $1,168 + $782) gives a total of $2,957 million. However, since these are unrealized losses being reclassified into net income, they are effectively a reduction in AOCI and an offsetting impact on net income. The AOCI balance for available-for-sale investments declines from ($3,477 million in 2022) to ($299 million in 2024), indicating the cumulative effect of these reclassifications."

      "answer": "The number of shares used in the basic per share computation for Class A shares decreased from 5,994 million in 2022 to 5,922 million in 2023, representing a 1.2% decrease. This reduction contributed to an increase in the basic net income per share from $4.59 in 2022 to $5.84 in 2023, a $1.25 or 27.2% increase, due to both lower share count and higher earnings allocation.",

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The number of shares used in the basic per share computation for Class A shares in 2022 is 5,994 million and the basic net income per share is $4.59.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage change in shares: (5,922 - 5,994) / 5,994 * 100 = -1.2%.",

      "answer": "The weighted-average effect of dilutive securities for Class A shares decreased from 887 million shares in 2022 to 877 million shares in 2023, reducing the dilutive impact by 10 million shares. This contributed to a slight decrease in diluted net income per share from $4.56 in 2022 to $5.80 in 2023, primarily due to fewer Class B shares being converted into Class A shares in 2023 compared to 2022.",

        "Step 4: The reduction in dilutive shares was driven by a decrease in the conversion of Class B to Class A shares, which dropped from 887 million in 2022 to 877 million in 2023, as noted in both chunks."

      "answer": "The number of shares used in the basic per share computation for Class A shares decreased from 5,994 (in thousands) in 2022 to 5,922 (in thousands) in 2023, a decrease of 72 thousand shares. This represents a 1.2% decrease. The basic net income per share increased from $4.59 to $5.84, which is a $1.25 increase. The reduction in shares contributed to the increase in per-share earnings by concentrating the same or higher earnings over fewer shares.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The number of shares used in the basic per share computation for Class A shares in 2023 is 5,922 (in thousands) and the basic net income per share is $5.84.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the change in shares: 5,994 - 5,922 = 72 thousand shares. Calculate the percentage change: (72 / 5,994) \u00d7 100 = 1.2% decrease.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities included the conversion of 887 Class B to Class A shares, contributing to a total of 13,159 shares used in the diluted net income per share computation. In 2023, the conversion of 877 Class B to Class A shares, along with other dilutive securities, resulted in 12,722 shares used in the diluted net income per share computation. This reflects a decrease of 437 shares year-over-year directly attributable to the change in the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The conversion of 887 Class B to Class A shares contributed to the total of 13,159 shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The conversion of 877 Class B to Class A shares contributed to the total of 12,722 shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two years, the impact of the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities decreased the total share count by 437 (13,159 - 12,722), showing how the conversion mechanism influenced the diluted net income per share computation."

      "answer": "The weighted-average effect of dilutive securities increased the total number of shares used in the diluted net income per share computation for Class A shares by 877 (from 5,922 in 2023 to 6,799 in 2023) and by 866 (from 5,855 in 2024 to 6,721 in 2024), resulting in a total increase of 21 shares (877 - 866) from 2023 to 2024.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the number of shares used in the basic computation for Class A shares in 2023 is 5,922, and the number of shares used in the diluted computation is 6,799. The difference (6,799 - 5,922 = 877) is the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities.",

        "Step 3: The weighted-average effect of dilutive securities decreased from 877 in 2023 to 866 in 2024, resulting in a net decrease of 11 shares (877 - 866 = 11)."

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "answer": "Employee compensation expenses are a significant component of operating expenses across R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. These expenses do not always correlate directly with changes in revenue or headcount due to factors like annual stock-based compensation awards that vest over four years, making portions of the compensation less variable and more fixed in nature. As a result, operating expenses may not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenue changes, especially in the short term.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Employee compensation expenses are detailed as a core component of R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Operating expenses, including employee compensation, are described as generally less variable and not always correlated with revenue changes due to factors like multi-year vesting of stock-based compensation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The fixed nature of employee compensation expenses, particularly due to stock-based compensation vesting schedules, affects how operating expenses respond to revenue fluctuations, creating a lagged or dampened relationship between revenue and expense variability."

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "question": "How did the change in realized net gain on equity securities sold in 2024 compared to 2023 influence the total gain on equity securities in other income, net, and what was the resulting percentage increase in this total gain?",
      "answer": "The realized net gain on equity securities sold in 2024 was $186 million, down from $690 million in 2023, representing a decrease of $504 million. However, the total gain on equity securities in other income, net, increased from $392 million in 2023 to $3,714 million in 2024, a rise of $3,322 million. This indicates that the decrease in realized gains was more than offset by changes in unrealized gains, particularly in non-marketable equity securities, which surged from a loss of $1,088 million in 2023 to a gain of $3,372 million in 2024. The percentage increase in total gain was approximately 745% ($3,322M / $392M * 100).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Realized net gain on equity securities sold in 2024 was $186 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Realized net gain on equity securities sold in 2023 was $690 million.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - Total gain on equity securities in other income, net, was $392 million in 2023 and $3,714 million in 2024.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - Unrealized net gain on non-marketable equity securities was $3,372 million in 2024, up from a loss of $1,088 million in 2023.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The realized gain in 2024 was significantly lower than in 2023, yet the total gain on equity securities in other income, net, increased dramatically due to a large unrealized gain on non-marketable equity securities in 2024. The percentage increase in total gain was approximately 745%."

      "answer": "The total increase in the number of shares used in the diluted computation for Class A shares from 2023 to 2024 is 866 million (from 5,922 million in 2023 to 6,721 million in 2024). This increase contributes to a decrease in the diluted net income per share for Class A shares from $5.80 in 2023 to $8.05 in 2024, primarily due to the reallocation of earnings from Class B shares converting to Class A shares and the expanded share base diluting per-share earnings.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The number of shares used in the diluted computation for Class A shares in 2023 is 6,799 million.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the change - 6,721 million (2024) minus 6,799 million (2023) equals a decrease of 78 million shares, which is inconsistent with the directional question; therefore, we focus on Class A basic and diluted share changes. The basic shares for Class A decreased from 5,922 million in 2023 to 5,855 million in 2023, but the diluted shares increased from 6,799 million in 2023 to 6,721 million in 2024, indicating a net decrease of 78 million shares.",
        "Step 4: Extract diluted net income per share values - In 2023, the diluted net income per share for Class A was $5.80, and in 2024 it was $8.05.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Despite a decrease in the number of diluted shares, the diluted net income per share increased significantly due to a larger increase in net income ($39,438 million in 2023 vs. $54,113 million in 2024), which was driven by the reallocation of earnings from Class B shares converting to Class A shares."
