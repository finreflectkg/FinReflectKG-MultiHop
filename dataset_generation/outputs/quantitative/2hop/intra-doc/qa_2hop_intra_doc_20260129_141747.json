This increase in liability would directly impact American Express's financial statements by raising operating expenses. Given that the Membership Rewards liability was a key contributor to higher net operating liabilities in 2021, which in turn helped drive net cash provided by operating activities, this sensitivity could further enhance operating cash flows by increasing the change in operating liabilities. However, it would also result in higher future redemption costs.",

The decline in Card Member loan and receivable balances was due to the ongoing pay down of outstanding balances by Card Members combined with significant declines in spending that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nIn 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares.\n\nIn 2020, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by growth in customer deposits.",

Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.\n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period.

However, regulatory pressures in the EU and Australia, including caps on interchange fees and related competitive pricing actions, exerted downward pressure on discount rates, potentially limiting the magnitude of revenue growth.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2021, we changed the way we describe our volume metrics, replacing billed business, proprietary billed business and GNS billed business with network volumes, billed business and processed volumes, respectively. Within processed volumes we now include transactions associated with certain alternative payment solutions that were not previously reported in our volume metrics. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation. Refer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' for definitions of each updated term.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\nOur results for the year reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen in our business throughout 2021, and our strategy of investing in our customers, brand and talent is helping in our effort to drive share, scale and relevance. Spending on our network reached record levels and credit metrics remained around historic lows. Net income more than doubled versus the prior year to $8.1 billion and exceeded 2019 levels; contributing to this increase in Net income in the current year was a $2.5 billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As certain of the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, and through the successful execution of our investment strategy, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2021.\n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed business, which represented 85 percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results, increased 25 percent and continued to show different paces of recovery for G&amp;S and T&amp;E spend. G&amp;S spend, which accounts for the majority of our billed business, grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, and was 18 percent above 2019 levels. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&amp;E spend grew 59 percent versus the prior year, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&amp;E volumes reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased 26 percent versus the prior year and exceeded 2019 levels by 6 percent, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises.\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double digit growth in all our non-interest revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. Other fees and commissions and Other revenues increased year-over-year, primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues. Net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021 and were up 11 percent year over year, as new card acquisitions increased, and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.\n\nCard Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables. We do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in 2022.\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over-year due to growth in spend and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Additionally, our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. During the year we increased marketing investments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased Card Member engagement and strong retention rates. Our operating expenses for 2021 were in line with 2020; however, the current year included sizeable net gains associated with the Amex Ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in 2022. We expect to continue to invest strategically in marketing, value propositions on our products, technology and our colleagues.",

The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the CFPB's final rule that sets forth additional requirements for third-party debt collection agencies, which we use in the ordinary course of business, became effective. See ' We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition ' under 'Risk Factors' for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us.\n\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the 'money transmitter' or 'sale of check' laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services.\n\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Regulators' expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm's systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.\n\n## Payments Regulation\n\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems.\n\nThe EU, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU and UK payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the UK. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU or the UK.\n\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See ' Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations ' under 'Risk Factors.'",

The Membership Rewards liability was $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management, (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge and (iii) the estimate of the WAC involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the methodology.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management's assumption to evaluate its reasonableness, (iii) evaluating management's methodology for determining the WAC assumption and (iv) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management's estimate.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 11, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.",

Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.\n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $140 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $168 million.",

      "answer": "American Express's Discount Revenue decreased from $26,167 million in 2019 to $25,727 million in 2021, a decline of $440 million. Regulatory pressure, particularly in the EU and Australia, has negatively impacted Discount Revenue due to caps on interchange fees and changes in network practices. These regulations have created downward pressure on discount rates and led American Express to exit its network businesses in both the EU and Australia.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Discount Revenue was $26,167 million in 2019 and $25,727 million in 2021, showing a decrease of $440 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The EU and Australia have imposed interchange fee caps and other regulatory changes that have negatively impacted Discount Revenue and led to American Express exiting its network businesses in those regions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Consumer Financial Products Regulation\n\nIn the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products, and authority to prevent 'unfair, deceptive or abusive' acts or practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the CFPB's final rule that sets forth additional requirements for third-party debt collection agencies, which we use in the ordinary course of business, became effective. See ' We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition ' under 'Risk Factors' for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us.\n\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the 'money transmitter' or 'sale of check' laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services.\n\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Regulators' expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm's systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.\n\n## Payments Regulation\n\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems.\n\nThe EU, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU and UK payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the UK. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU or the UK.\n\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See ' Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations ' under 'Risk Factors.'",

Unlike U.S. banking subsidiaries that are regulated by U.S. authorities such as the Federal Reserve and FDIC, BNY SA/NV is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, identify that BNY SA/NV is the main European banking subsidiary and its operational focus across multiple European branches.",

      "question": "How do the risks associated with BNY Mellon's failure to maintain 'well capitalized' regulatory status and its dependency on dividends from subsidiaries jointly impact its net worth and financial stability?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's failure to maintain 'well capitalized' regulatory status could result in limitations on its activities and adversely affect its business and financial condition. Additionally, the Parent company's dependency on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet obligations, including securities-related commitments and shareholder returns, introduces further financial risk. If regulatory constraints limit the subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, the Parent may face liquidity challenges, reducing its ability to maintain capital levels and potentially decreasing its net worth. Together, these factors could significantly impair BNY Mellon's financial stability and net worth by restricting capital inflows and increasing funding costs.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Failure to maintain 'well capitalized' status could result in limitations on activities and adversely affect business and financial condition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The Parent is a non-operating holding company dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet obligations, including shareholder returns and securities-related commitments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of regulatory capital risk and dependency on subsidiary dividends creates a dual exposure: regulatory constraints may limit operational flexibility while also reducing capital inflows, both of which negatively affect net worth and financial stability."

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nThe Company continued its consistent approach to balance sheet management in 2021, supporting overall growth and liquidity. Total balance sheet assets rose to $667.3 billion at December 31, 2021, increasing 22% from year-end 2020, driven primarily by client asset flows, as well as $10.6 billion in BDA balance migrations. We also added a net $10.2 billion to outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt for liquidity management purposes, and increased preferred stock by a net $2.3 billion to help support continued business growth. The Company's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.2% at year-end 2021.\n\nThough significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021 impacted our service quality at times, we took multiple actions to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on, including enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining our call-routing processes, and increasing hiring. Our efforts began yielding results early in the year, with significant improvement in client service levels by the end of the first quarter, and our service levels continued to be improved throughout the remainder of 2021 as client activity moderated.\n\n## 2020 Compared to 2019\n\nThroughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020, Schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives, and produced solid financial results. The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company's strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company's key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic's rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve's further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&amp;P 500 erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019. \u00ae\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Schwab's net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019. (1)\n\nTotal net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interestearning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion.\n\nGrowing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\n\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders' equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. ROTCE was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders' equity and ROTCE were due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio. (1) (1)\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. (1)",

Early in 2021 we saw strengthened investor optimism, fueled by an advancing economic recovery and signs of improvement in the COVID-19 pandemic. As the year progressed, debates increased over the pace of economic growth, the path of inflation, and the ultimate impact of multiple global market disruptions. After major equity indices rose throughout the first half of 2021, they were essentially flat during the summer months before ending the year at near-record levels. While short-term interest rates remained near zero throughout 2021, longer-term rates began to rise initially, then eased and rose again as the 10-year Treasury yield finally ended 2021 at 1.52%, up 59 basis points from year-end 2020.\n\nInvestors were actively engaged with the markets throughout 2021, including extraordinary trading volume in the first quarter, and client activity throughout the remainder of the year also generally exceeded the fourth quarter of 2020 when we included TD Ameritrade in our results for the first time. Asset gathering was strong throughout 2021, as core net new assets totaled $558.2 billion, representing an 8% annual organic growth rate from year-end 2020. We ended 2021 with $8.14 trillion in client assets and 33.2 million brokerage accounts, representing increases of 22% and 12%, respectively, from December 31, 2020. Even as we worked to support heightened levels of client activity during 2021, the Company continued to drive progress across our key strategic priorities of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, and segmentation. We made significant progress on our integration of TD Ameritrade, and continue to expect to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 acquisition date.\n\nSchwab produced strong financial performance during 2021, reflecting consistent execution of our strategy, strong client engagement, and a generally supportive macroeconomic backdrop. Net income totaled $5.9 billion during 2021, increasing 77% from 2020, while diluted earnings per common share (EPS) amounted to $2.83, increasing 33% from the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS , which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $3.25, increasing 33% from 2020. Our financial results were significantly impacted by the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for the full year of 2021. (1)\n\nTotal net revenues increased 58% from 2020 to reach $18.5 billion in 2021, supported by growth across all of our major revenue streams. Net interest revenue totaled $8.0 billion in 2021, increasing 31% from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as significant growth in interest-earning assets, including rising investment portfolio balances and increased utilization of our range of lending products, partially offset by lower average yields. Asset management and administration fees grew 23% over the prior year to reach $4.3 billion due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as rising balances in advice solutions and both proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by lower revenue on money market funds.\n\nTrading revenue was $4.2 billion in 2021, nearly three times the prior year total of $1.4 billion, as the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade and the overall strong trading environment drove a significant increase in DATs. Trading revenue was also helped in 2021 by a higher proportion of derivatives trades, which contributed to higher revenue per trade. A full year of bank deposit account fees totaled $1.3 billion in 2021. BDA balances totaled $158.6 billion at December 31, 2021, down 3% from the year-end 2020 balance of $163.5 billion, reflecting migrations to Schwab's balance sheet during 2021.\n\nTotal expenses excluding interest were $10.8 billion in 2021, increasing 46% from 2020 due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results as well as higher compensation and benefits expense, which was driven by additional headcount to support our expanding client base and a higher bonus accrual, as well as merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase we implemented at the end of the third quarter. During 2021, acquisition and integration-related costs were $468 million, increasing from $442 million in 2020, and amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled $615 million, rising from $190 million in 2020. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses were $9.7 billion in 2021, increasing 44% from 2020. (1)\n\nReturn on average common stockholders' equity was 11% in 2021, growing from 9% in 2020, and return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 22% in 2021, up from 15% in 2020. The increases in both return on average common stockholders' equity and ROTCE were primarily a result of significantly higher net income in 2021. (1)\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. (1)",

      "answer": "Schwab's exclusion of amortization of acquired intangible assets increases the adjusted net income used in the calculation of return on tangible common equity, which is defined as annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Management considers this adjustment useful because acquisitions result in significant goodwill and acquired intangible assets, which affect the balance sheet composition. By excluding these items, investors can better assess capital efficiency and returns relative to the ongoing operations of the business, rather than being influenced by non-recurring or non-operational accounting impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Return on tangible common equity is defined as annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity, which excludes goodwill, acquired intangible assets - net, and related deferred tax liabilities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Schwab excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets when calculating non-GAAP measures like return on tangible common equity because management believes these items are not indicative of underlying operating performance and acquisitions distort the balance sheet by adding significant intangible assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The exclusion of amortization increases adjusted net income, which improves the return metric. This adjustment, combined with the removal of intangible assets from equity, allows for a clearer view of operational capital efficiency, as stated in both evidence chunks."

Total expenses excluding interest included amounts from TD Ameritrade of $3.1 billion in 2021 and $943 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $3.0 billion, or 44%, in 2021 from 2020 and $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.\n\nTotal compensation and benefits increased in 2021 from 2020 due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade and growth in employee headcount. The 2021 increase reflected TDA's full-year contribution of $1.2 billion of compensation and benefits expense compared with $453 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, a higher bonus accrual, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Total compensation and benefits expense increased from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount related to our acquisitions of TDA and USAA-IMCO. The increase in 2020 from 2019 also reflected the Company's payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $283 million and $235 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nProfessional services expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million.\n\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA's results of operations, costs related to the integration of TD Ameritrade, and overall growth in the business.

      "answer": "MA's cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased from $9.2 billion in 2023 to $8.8 billion in 2024, a decline of $0.4 billion. At the same time, its unused line of credit remained unchanged at $8.0 billion. The reduction in cash reserves suggests a potential drawdown of liquid assets during 2024, possibly for operational needs, investments, or shareholder returns. The unchanged credit facility indicates that MA still maintains a strong liquidity buffer, which could provide flexibility despite the decline in cash holdings.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The decline in cash reserves combined with a stable credit facility suggests a shift in liquidity management, potentially signaling asset utilization for strategic purposes while maintaining borrowing capacity."

This amount, when added to the Net Income of $11,195 million, contributed to the Comprehensive Income of $11,349 million for the year, showing a direct relationship between tax-adjusted OCI and the increase in total comprehensive income beyond net income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The 'Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income tax effect' for 2023 is $154 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The 'Net Income' for 2023 is $11,195 million and 'Comprehensive Income' for the same year is $11,349 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference between Comprehensive Income and Net Income: $11,349 million - $11,195 million = $154 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The difference between Net Income and Comprehensive Income in 2023 is exactly equal to the net tax effect on OCI, demonstrating that the tax-adjusted OCI directly accounts for the increase from Net Income to Comprehensive Income."

They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business  confidence,  behavior  and  activity,  changes  to  interest  rates  and  other  market  risk  factors,  and  governmental  or  other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other  reasons,  losses  incurred  in  our  general  account  and  the  impact  of  guarantees,  including  increases  in  liabilities,  capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\n\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived  returns.  This  may  result  in  cash  outflows  requiring  the  sale  of  investments  on  less  favorable  terms,  resulting  in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ('VOBA'), reducing net income, harming our credit  instrument  covenants  and  rating  agency  assessment  of  our  financial  condition.  Interest  rate  increases  may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity  needs.  Furthermore,  if  interest  rates  rise,  our  unrealized  gains  on  fixed  income  securities  may  decrease  and  our unrealized  losses  may  increase.  We  would  recognize  the  accumulated  change  in  estimated  fair  value  of  these  fixed  income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\n\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may  not  be  able  to  invest  assets  at  the  full  liability  duration,  thereby  creating  some  asset/liability  mismatch.  In  addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation  in  equity  markets  is  not  changed  by  short-term  market  fluctuations  but  is  only  changed  when  sustained  interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a longterm separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 5.75%.\n\nWe  periodically  review  long-term  assumptions  underlying  the  projections  of  estimated  gross  margins  and  profits.  These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses  to  administer  business. Assumptions  used  in  the  calculation  of  estimated  gross  margins  and  profits  which  may  have significantly  changed  are  updated  annually.  If  the  update  of  assumptions  causes  expected  future  gross  margins  and  profits  to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\n\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder  dividends  on  participating  traditional  life  contracts,  variable  and  universal  life  contracts  and  annuity  contracts.  We expect  these  assumptions  to  be  the  ones  most  reasonably  likely  to  cause  significant  changes  in  the  future.  Changes  in  these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $16.1 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross  margins  or  profits  with  actual  gross  margins  or  profits  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020.  Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.\n\n",

These  include  variable,  universal,  term  and  whole  life  insurance,  variable,  fixed  and  index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance.\n\n## Corporate &amp; Other\n\nCorporate &amp; Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate &amp; Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs,  internal  resource  costs  for  associates  committed  to  acquisitions  and  dispositions  and  enterprise-wide  strategic  initiative restructuring charges), interest expense related to the majority of the Company's outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal  proceedings  and  income  tax  audit  issues,  the  elimination  of  intersegment  amounts  (which  generally  relate  to  affiliated reinsurance,  investment  expenses  and  intersegment  loans  bearing  interest  rates  commensurate  with  related  borrowings),  and  the Company's investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide).\n\n## Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment  reporting,  adjusted  earnings  is  also  the  Company's  GAAP  measure  of  segment  performance  and  is  reported  below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 110.8% factor means employees receive 10.8% more shares than the original grant, assuming full vesting, based on MetLife's performance relative to its financial plan and shareholder return benchmarks."

      "answer": "A 100 basis point increase in the assumed future rate of return results in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization. According to the 2022 10-K filing, this change has a net financial effect of approximately $30 million, with an offset to the unearned revenue liability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document explains that updates to long-term assumptions, such as investment returns, affect the amortization of DAC and VOBA. If expected future gross margins and profits increase, DAC and VOBA amortization decreases, increasing current period earnings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The document quantifies the financial impact: a 100 basis point increase (or decrease) in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a $30 million net change in DAC and VOBA amortization, offset by a change in the unearned revenue liability."

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles (continued)\n\n## Credit Insurance and Other Short-Duration Contracts\n\nThe  Company  amortizes  DAC  for  these  contracts,  which  is  primarily  composed  of  commissions  and  certain  underwriting expenses, in proportion to actual and future earned premium over the applicable contract term.\n\n## Factors Impacting Amortization\n\nSeparate  account  rates  of  return  on  variable  universal  life  contracts  and  variable  deferred  annuity  contracts  affect  in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the Company's long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which increases the Company's  future  fee  expectations  and  decreases  future  benefit  payment  expectations  on  minimum  death  and  living  benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the Company's long-term expectation. The Company's practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation changes.\n\nThe Company also periodically reviews other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency,  policyholder  behavior  and  expenses  to  administer  business.  Management  annually  updates  assumptions  used  in  the calculation  of  estimated  gross  margins  and  profits  which  may  have  significantly  changed.  If  the  update  of  assumptions  causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\n\nPeriodically, the Company modifies product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for a new  contract,  or  by  amendment,  endorsement,  or  rider  to  a  contract,  or  by  election  or  coverage  within  a  contract.  If  such modification, referred to as an internal replacement, substantially changes the contract, the associated DAC or VOBA is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred. If the modification does  not  substantially  change  the  contract,  the  DAC  or  VOBA  amortization  on  the  original  contract  will  continue  and  any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are expensed.\n\nAmortization of DAC and VOBA is attributed to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), and to other expenses for the amount of gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Unrealized investment gains and losses represent the amount of DAC and VOBA that would have been amortized if such gains and losses had been recognized.",

Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation  in  equity  markets  is  not  changed  by  short-term  market  fluctuations  but  is  only  changed  when  sustained  interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a longterm separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 5.75%.\n\nWe  periodically  review  long-term  assumptions  underlying  the  projections  of  estimated  gross  margins  and  profits.  These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses  to  administer  business. Assumptions  used  in  the  calculation  of  estimated  gross  margins  and  profits  which  may  have significantly  changed  are  updated  annually.  If  the  update  of  assumptions  causes  expected  future  gross  margins  and  profits  to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\n\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder  dividends  on  participating  traditional  life  contracts,  variable  and  universal  life  contracts  and  annuity  contracts.  We expect  these  assumptions  to  be  the  ones  most  reasonably  likely  to  cause  significant  changes  in  the  future.  Changes  in  these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $16.1 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross  margins  or  profits  with  actual  gross  margins  or  profits  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020.  Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.\n\n",

This increase contributes to a $57 million rise in deferred tax liabilities related to ROU lease assets (from $(96) million in 2023 to $(153) million in 2024), which in turn reduces the net deferred tax assets from $2,772 million in 2023 to $2,768 million in 2024.",

This decrease was driven by a $2,825 million decline in hedging-designated contracts (from $6,767 million to $3,942 million) and an $708 million decline in non-hedging-designated contracts (from $14,025 million to $13,317 million).",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Total foreign exchange contracts value for 2024 is $17,259 million and for 2023 is $20,792 million.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Calculate the total year-over-year change by subtracting 2024 total from 2023 total ($20,792M - $17,259M = $3,533M). Break down the change by contract type: hedging contracts decreased by $2,825 million and non-hedging contracts decreased by $708 million."

      "answer": "The value of ROU lease assets increased by $57 million, from $96 million as of December 31, 2023, to $153 million as of December 31, 2024. This increase directly corresponds to the change in deferred tax liabilities related to ROU lease assets, which also rose from $96 million to $153 million over the same period. According to the evidence, ROU lease assets are explicitly tied to deferred tax liabilities, as shown in the deferred tax liabilities table, where ROU lease assets are listed as a direct component of total deferred tax liabilities.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, the value of ROU lease assets was $96 million as of December 31, 2023, and $153 million as of December 31, 2024, showing an increase of $57 million.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, the deferred tax liabilities specifically tied to ROU lease assets matched these figures exactly\u2014$96 million in 2023 and $153 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a, it is confirmed that ROU lease assets are evaluated for impairment and measured using observable market data, and are explicitly connected to deferred tax liabilities in the broader context of financial reporting."

( 2)\n\nConsists of ROU lease assets recorded at fair value pursuant to impairment charges that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. (3)\n\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2024, we measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale using observable inputs, such as the most recent executed prices for comparable loans sold to the global investment firm. Accordingly, loans and interest receivable, held for sale are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' for additional information on loans and interest receivable, held for sale.\n\nWe measure the non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable price changes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value based on valuation methods which only include significant inputs that are observable, such as the observable transaction price at the transaction date. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 when we estimate fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as when we remeasure due to impairment and use discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\n\nWe evaluate ROU assets related to leases for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an ROU asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses on ROU lease assets related to office operating leases are calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data, and the impaired asset is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nOur financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, loans and interest receivable, net, certain customer accounts, notes receivable, and long-term debt related to borrowings on our credit facilities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value. Our term debt (including  current  portion)  in  the  form  of  fix ed  rate  notes  had  a  carrying  value  of  approx imately  $10.5  billion  and  fair  value  of  approx imately  $9.8  billion  as  of December 31, 2024. Our term debt (including current portion) in the form of fixed rate notes had a carrying value of approximately $10.6 billion and fair value of approximately $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. If these financial instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash would be classified as Level 1; restricted cash, time deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, certain customer accounts, and term debt (including current portion) would be classified as Level 2; and the remaining financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## NOTE 10-DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\n## SUMMARY OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions and by entering into collateral security arrangements. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not use any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n94",

The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $307 million and included employee severance and benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense, which were substantially completed by the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimated reduction in annualized employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately $575 million, including approximately $165 million in stock-based compensation. We reinvested a portion of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce to drive business priorities.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, management initiated a global workforce reduction intended to focus resources on core strategic priorities, and improve our cost structure and operating efficiency. The associated restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $122 million. We primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs, which were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFor information on the associated restructuring liabilities, see 'Note 17-Restructuring and Other' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\nWe continue to review our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We incurred asset impairment charges of nil and $61 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to exiting certain leased properties, which resulted in a reduction of right-of-use lease assets and related leasehold improvements.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of $17 million due to the sale of an owned property. We also incurred a loss of $14 million related to another owned property, which was previously held for sale, in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $129 million and $74 million of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss  on  sale  of  loans  and  interest  receivable  previously  held  for  sale  (inclusive  of  transaction  costs)  and  fair  value  adjustments  to  measure  loans  and  interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\n\n## Other income (expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net of $4 million in 2024 decreased $379 million compared to $383 million in 2023. This decline in other income (expense), net was due primarily to net losses and impairments on strategic investments in the current period compared to net gains in the prior period, which contributed a decline of approximately $490 million year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $180 million resulting from an increase in average cash balances and interest rates year-over-year.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nOur effective income tax rate was 22% in both 2024 and 2023. Our effective income tax rate in 2024 remained consistent compared to 2023 and was impacted primarily by changes in jurisdictional mix of income, U.S. income taxed at different rates, discrete tax adjustments, and tax expense in prior period associated with sale of a divested business. See 'Note 16-Income Taxes' to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe  require  liquidity  and  access  to  capital  to  fund  our  global  operations,  including  our  customer  protection  programs,  credit  products,  capital  ex penditures, investments  in  our  business,  potential  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments,  working  capital,  and  other  cash  needs.  We  believe  that  our  ex isting  cash,  cash equivalents, and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third-party sources, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.",

Additionally, we recognized a gain of $17 million due to the sale of an owned property and incurred a loss of $14 million related to another owned property held for sale in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## OTHER\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $129 million and $74 million, respectively, of losses were recorded in restructuring and other, which included net loss on sale of loans and interest receivable previously held for sale (inclusive of transactions costs) and fair value adjustments to measure loans and interest receivable, held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of Happy Returns and recorded a pre-tax gain of $339 million, net of transaction costs, in restructuring and other.

      "question": "How does the regulatory pressure on interchange fees in the EU and Australia, as described in the Risk Factors section, specifically affect American Express's discount revenue model, considering the way discount revenue is recognized and retained from merchant transactions?",
      "answer": "Regulatory pressure on interchange fees in the EU and Australia has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact American Express's discount revenue by exerting downward pressure on merchant discount rates. This occurs because competitor pricing adjustments in response to interchange fee caps influence American Express's own pricing strategy. Since discount revenue is recognized at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and is retained as part of the merchant payable for facilitating transactions, any reduction in discount rates directly reduces the revenue earned per transaction. Additionally, American Express has exited its network businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory constraints, which further limits its ability to generate discount revenue in those regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Discount revenue is recognized at the time of Card Member transaction and is retained from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Regulation of interchange fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact discount revenue due to downward pressure on merchant discount rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since discount revenue is directly tied to transaction volume and discount rates, regulatory pressure that leads to lower rates or reduced operational presence (as in the EU and Australia) directly reduces the amount of discount revenue recognized per transaction and overall revenue generation."

      "answer": "The 2023 administrative proceeding by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets regarding AXP's cobrand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which was referred to the EU Court of Justice, created regulatory uncertainty about the application of interchange fee caps in cobrand arrangements. This uncertainty, combined with existing fee capping regulations in the EU, increased the risk that AXP would not be able to maintain its existing cobrand and agent relationships. As a result, AXP faced downward pressure on its merchant discount rates, which directly impacted its discount revenue. In 2023, AXP reported that regulatory changes, including interchange fee caps, had already negatively impacted its discount revenue and could continue to do so, with merchant discount rate erosion further compounded by increased merchant acceptance and competition from alternative payment models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, in August 2023, the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal referred questions to the EU Court of Justice regarding the interpretation of interchange fee caps in connection with AXP's cobrand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, AXP noted that differing interpretations of EU regulations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements exposed the company to regulatory action, penalties, and the possibility of not maintaining existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_a, AXP stated that regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in international markets, including caps on interchange fees, had negatively impacted its discount revenue and may continue to do so.",
        "Step 4: AXP further explained in evidence_source_a that downward pressure on merchant discount rates, driven in part by regulatory changes, could materially and adversely affect its revenues and profitability, especially if it could not offset declining rates with increased volumes or differentiated value."

      "question": "How does the $35.3 billion exposure from unbilled purchases related to merchant non-delivery risk, as disclosed in the 2023 10-K, potentially affect American Express's network volumes, and what contractual obligations tied to performance triggers could further impact this financial metric?",
      "answer": "The $35.3 billion exposure from unbilled purchases assumes all merchants cease operations and cannot deliver goods or services, which could significantly reduce American Express's network volumes if such losses lead to fewer merchants accepting the card or fewer customers using it due to diminished trust. Additionally, contractual obligations requiring American Express to make or accelerate payments to cobrand partners upon performance shortfalls could further strain liquidity and reduce the company's ability to maintain or grow network volumes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Network volumes - Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes.' This defines the financial metric central to the question.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'At December 31, 2023, our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchases that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $35.3 billion.' This provides the specific risk exposure tied to merchant non-delivery.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.' This shows how contractual obligations could further impact network volumes by affecting liquidity and merchant participation.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The $35.3 billion exposure could reduce network volumes by eroding merchant and consumer confidence. Contractual obligations triggered by performance shortfalls could further impact the company's ability to sustain or grow network volumes by straining financial resources."

The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Discount revenue - Represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Goods & Services (G&S) spend - Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Interest expense - Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. |\n| Interest income - Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Interest on loans - Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Interest and dividends on investment securities - Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.                                                                                                    |\n| Interest income on deposits with banks and other - Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Loyalty coalitions - Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Net card fees - Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Net interest yield on average Card Member loans - A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Net write-off rate - principal only - Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Net write-off rate - principal, interest and fees - Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Network volumes - Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Operating expenses - Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |",

However, regulations such as interchange fee caps in the EU and Australia have created downward pressure on merchant discount rates by limiting pricing flexibility. This directly constrains American Express\u2019s ability to sustain or expand Discount Revenue growth, as seen in their exit from network businesses in those regions and ongoing regulatory uncertainty affecting cobrand and agent relationships.",

      "answer": "The geographic concentration of Card Member loans in states like California, Florida, New York, Texas, Georgia, and New Jersey increases American Express's exposure to regional disruptions caused by natural disasters or economic instability. Since Card Member loans are revolving and subject to finance charges, any event that negatively impacts the credit performance of borrowers in these regions\u2014such as hurricanes or climate-related events\u2014can lead to higher delinquencies, defaults, and ultimately, greater credit loss reserves. This dynamic undermines the predictability and stability of net interest income derived from these loans.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Card Member loans are revolving, subject to finance charges, and presented net of credit loss reserves.",

We are at the forefront of the industry across multiple lines in terms of driving rate momentum while simultaneously increasing the level of business retained in targeted lines. As we see disruption in the marketplace, we are well placed to capitalize on opportunities.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, AIG entered into a series of quota share reinsurance agreements, including with Lloyd's Syndicate 2019, a Lloyd's syndicate managed by Talbot Underwriting Ltd., and with PCG 2019 Corporate Member Ltd., both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of AIG, to cede PCG business written by our General Insurance operations to third parties. Overall, these ceded reinsurance transactions, accounted for under ASC 944 Financial Services - Insurance, further AIG's continued optimization of its General Insurance portfolio, create additional products for clients and diversify AIG's capital base. We consolidate our interest in Lloyd's Syndicate 2019 and account for the reinsurance transactions in a manner consistent with other third-party reinsurance arrangements.\n\nUnderwriting losses decreased in 2021 compared to the prior year by $1.3 billion primarily due to significantly lower catastrophe losses, improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, higher net favorable prior year reserve development and a lower expense ratio.\n\nNet premiums written increased in 2021 compared to the prior year by $1.9 billion primarily due to growth in Commercial Lines driven by strong rate improvement, higher renewal retentions, strong new business production and lower ceded premiums driven by 2020 quota share reinsurance agreements. While net premiums written increased across most Commercial Lines, the increase was particularly strong within our AIG Re, Casualty, Financial Lines and Property businesses. In Personal Lines, our Travel business benefitted from increased consumer spending, while our Warranty business saw growth in new and existing programs.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 93",

In 2021, catastrophe losses decreased by $672 million compared to 2020, which contributed to a $1.3 billion decrease in underwriting loss.

This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nincome or loss from discontinued operations;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nchanges in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/JAAAAA+LiberationSerif-BoldItalic&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/JAAAAA+LiberationSerif-BoldItalic&gt;\n\nchanges in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and deferred sales inducements (DSI) related to net realized gains and losses;\n\nchanges in the fair value of equity securities;\n\nnet investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;\n\nfollowing deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;\n\nloss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;\n\nall net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nnet loss reserve discount benefit (charge);\n\npension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;\n\nnet gain or loss on divestitures;\n\nnon-operating litigation reserves and settlements;\n\nrestructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;\n\nthe portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;\n\nintegration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;\n\nlosses from the impairment of goodwill; and non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles.\n\n## General Insurance\n\n- -Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n- -Accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.\n\n## Life and Retirement\n\n- -Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.\n\nResults from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.\n\n58 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n- -Accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.\n\n## Life and Retirement\n\n- -Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.\n\nResults from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.\n\n58 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The reclassification of $758 million in Card Member loans to held-for-sale status and the reversal of $49 million in associated credit loss reserves temporarily boosts American Express's short-term financial flexibility by freeing up capital and reducing liabilities. However, as these loans are no longer generating ongoing discount revenue (since the company will continue to recognize discount revenue only until the loans are sold), this could reduce the long-term revenue stream from these accounts. Given that American Express faces competitive pressures, including declining merchant discount rates and increasing incentives offered to merchants and partners, the loss of ongoing discount revenue from these reclassified loans could exacerbate the challenge of maintaining revenue growth. This dynamic highlights the tension between short-term capital optimization and long-term revenue sustainability in a competitive environment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## BALANCE SHEET\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs.\n\n## Card Member Loans HFS\n\nWhen we decide to sell Card Member loans, they are reclassified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Card Member loans held for sale and measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value (LOCOM). Refer to Note 14 for additional information regarding the valuation methodology for Card Member loans HFS. At the time of HFS reclassification, we first write-off amounts in accordance with our policy and then reverse any remaining reserves for credit losses associated with the HFS loans, the net impact of which is recognized within Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. HFS loans will continue to be remeasured at LOCOM until they are sold, with any changes in valuation recognized in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We will continue to recognize discount revenue, interest income and other revenues and expenses related to the HFS loans until they are sold.\n\nEffective December 1, 2024, we reclassified $758 million of Card Member loans related to the Lowe's small business cobrand portfolio to Card Member loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reversed $49 million of associated reserves for credit losses.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager.\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of November 1, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, we perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets.\n\nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment.\n\nThis qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows ex pected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies' multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units' operating results.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we performed assessments for each reporting unit in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units ex ceeded their carrying values and accordingly no impairment was recognized.",

See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.\n\nSimilarly, we are ex posed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor additional information relating to operational risks of our business partners, see ' We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business ' below.\n\n## We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms.

      "question": "How does American Express's exposure to credit risk in the airline industry, representing 7% of worldwide billed business, compound the challenges it faces in maintaining stable discount revenue amid competitive pricing pressures?",
      "answer": "American Express faces a dual threat to its discount revenue. First, it has significant exposure to the airline industry, which accounts for 7% of its worldwide billed business. If airlines face financial distress or fail to deliver services (e.g., unused tickets), American Express may be obligated to reimburse Card Members, directly impacting its financial condition. Second, the company is under pressure to maintain merchant discount rates due to competition, regulatory changes, and surcharging practices. These pricing pressures reduce the amount of discount revenue earned per transaction. The combination of potential losses from airline-related reimbursements and declining discount rates threatens the overall stability and growth of American Express's core revenue stream, limiting its ability to invest in innovation and merchant value-added services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, discount revenue is a core component of American Express's income, derived from merchant fees charged for transaction facilitation.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, American Express has significant exposure to the airline industry, representing 7% of worldwide billed business, and may bear losses if airlines fail to deliver services for which payments have already been made.",
        "Step 3: Also from evidence_source_b, American Express faces downward pressure on merchant discount rates due to competition, regulatory changes, and alternative payment technologies, which could reduce discount revenue.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The combination of potential losses from airline-related credit risk and declining discount rates creates a compounding threat to American Express\u2019s financial performance and ability to maintain revenue stability."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. We have elected to not disclose revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts with variable consideration (e.g., discount revenue). Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to all other contracts with customers is not material.\n\nPayments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, network partners and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense.\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fix ed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party, we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of qualifying acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Service Fees and Other Revenue\n\nService fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees, which are generally recognized in the period when the service is performed, and delinquency and foreign currency-related fees, which are primarily recognized in the period when they are charged to the Card Member. In addition, Service fees and other revenue includes income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence and therefore account for under the equity method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\n\n## Processed Revenue\n\nProcessed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we settle with merchants and our third-party merchant acquirers on behalf of our network card issuing partners. The amount of fees charged for accepting American Express-branded cards is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant or third-party merchant acquirer and recorded as Processed revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contra-revenue within Processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer, after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as ex pense in Business development.",

We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member.

We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms.

These actions could reduce the volume of transactions on AXP's network and erode merchant discount rates. Additionally, surcharging and steering practices in certain jurisdictions may suppress card usage, particularly if merchants apply higher surcharges to American Express cards or promote competing networks.

We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member.

Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rates and network and loan volumes.\n\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results.

In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, such as limiting the use of our cards for certain transactions. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements.

      "answer": "Regulatory pressure on interchange fees has created downward pressure on American Express's merchant discount rates, as competitors adjust pricing in response to caps. This directly reduces the discount revenue American Express earns. Additionally, increased merchant surcharging, particularly in categories like airlines where American Express has a 7 percent exposure in billed business, discourages card usage and harms the customer experience. This dual impact\u2014lower rates due to regulation and reduced transaction volume due to surcharging\u2014collectively harms discount revenue.

        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - American Express has observed increased merchant surcharging on its cards, particularly in certain categories, which harms the customer experience and could materially adversely affect card usage and discount revenue.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The combination of regulatory-driven discount rate erosion and surcharging-induced usage decline, especially in high-exposure sectors like airlines, creates a compounded negative impact on American Express's discount revenue."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the 'money transmitter' or 'sale of check' laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services. Our merchant acquiring business, and the third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we have relationships, are also subject to certain aspects of regulation under consumer protection laws, such as by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. For example, the Financial Conduct Authority's Consumer Duty in the United Kingdom, among other things, requires firms to act to deliver 'good outcomes' for retail customers with respect to products and services, price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Regulators' expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm's systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.\n\n## Payments Regulation\n\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad regulatory regimes for payment systems.\n\nPricing for card acceptance, including interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), has been a focus of legislators and regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU, the United States and other jurisdictions. Recently, certain states in the United States have passed or are considering laws prohibiting interchange from being charged on all or certain components of transactions, such as sales tax and gratuities. Jurisdictions have also sought to regulate various other aspects of network operations and contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance, including information associated with electronic transactions, such as state legislation regarding the use of specific merchant categories codes or limiting the use of transaction data.\n\nRegulation and other governmental actions relating to operations, pricing or practices could affect all networks and/or acquirers directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants. For example, we exited our network business in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In 2018, the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) confirmed the validity of fee capping and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although its ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. In December 2024, the CJEU held a hearing on questions referred by the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal regarding the interpretation of the application of the interchange fee caps in connection with an administrative proceeding by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets regarding our cobrand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; the CJEU has not yet issued a decision. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our ex isting cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' under 'Risk Factors.'\n\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU, Australia and Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec), merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, we also encounter steering or differential acceptance practices by merchants, which could also have a material adverse effect on us.

Catastrophic events may also reduce economic activity in affected areas, which could harm our existing business or prospects for new business, or the value of our investments. The severity of claims from catastrophic events may be higher if property values increase due to inflation or other factors or our insured lives or property are geographically concentrated.\n\nPandemics and other public health issues or other events, and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, may affect economic conditions and may cause a large number of illnesses or deaths. Hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, floods and mudslides, blackouts and man-made events such as riot, insurrection, terrorist attacks or acts of war may also cause catastrophic losses and increased claims. Any such catastrophes may also result in changes in consumer or business confidence, behavior and investment and business activity, changes to interest rates and other market risk factors, and governmental or other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods.\n\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. The liabilities we have established may not be adequate to cover our actual claim liabilities. Our efforts to manage risks may be impeded by restrictions on our ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas or on the availability of reinsurance in such markets. We may be unable to obtain catastrophe reinsurance at rates we find acceptable, or at all. We may also be called upon to make contributions to guaranty associations or similar organizations as a result of catastrophes.\n\n## We May Face Direct or Indirect Effects of Climate Change or Responses to It\n\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of short-, medium-, or long-term weather-related disasters, public health incidents, wildfires, rising sea levels and pandemics, and their effects may increase over time. Changes in policy, regulation, technology or market behaviors in response to climate change may harm the value of investments we hold or harm our counterparties, including reinsurers, or increase our compliance costs. Our regulators may also increasingly focus their examinations on our management of climate-related risks.\n\n## We May Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block, and May Not Re-Allocate Closed Block Assets\n\nThe closed block assets established in connection with the MLIC demutualization, their cash flows, and the revenue from the closed block policies may not be sufficient to provide for the policies' guaranteed benefits. If they are not, we must fund the shortfall. We may choose, for competitive or other reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or a period of sustained low market yields, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and/or the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative. Reductions in net income from these factors may in turn harm our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition.\n\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating the sensitivity of our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may not be able to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while certain hedged items may follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges  in  credit  spreads  may  result  in  market  price  volatility  and  cash  flow  variability.  Market  price  volatility  may  result  in  defaults  and  a  lack  of  pricing transparency, and can make valuations of our securities difficult if trading becomes less frequent, which may require us to add to our reserves. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments. The discount rate used to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits includes a component for market credit spreads that does not necessarily align to our investment spreads. Changes in market credit spreads could result in volatility to liabilities for future policy benefits relative to our asset values.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity and life insurance business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity and life products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit ex posure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds, real estate ventures, real estate funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash, which may differ from performance of public equity markets, which drives performance of our equity hedges. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.",

Risk Factors\n\nAny or each of the events described below may (or may continue to) adversely affect the global economy or global financial markets, or our reputation, regulatory, customer, or other relationships, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, statutory capital position, ability to meet our obligations, credit and financial strength ratings, financial condition, or the market price of our common stock. The effects may vary depending on timing, product, market, region or segment.\n\nMany of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of any of them may cause others to emerge or worsen. Such combinations could materially increase the severity of the cumulative or separate impact of these risks.\n\nThese risk factors do not describe all potential risks that could affect MetLife. Y ou should carefully consider the risk factors together with other information contained in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  including  'Business,'  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  and  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' and other reports and materials MetLife submits to the SEC.\n\n## Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks\n\n## We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions\n\nMarket factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, declining equity or debt markets, derivative prices and availability, real estate conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, government default or spending reductions to avoid default, business investment, climate change, public health risks, volatility,  disruptions  and  strength  of  the  capital  markets,  deflation  and  inflation,  and  government  actions  in  response  thereto,  may  inhibit  revenue  growth,  reduce investment opportunities and result in reduced investment returns or losses, derivative losses, reductions in fees generated, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\n\nHigher unemployment, changes to inflation, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, greater government regulation, lower business investment, lower consumer spending, elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations, lapses or surrenders of policies, reduced demand for our products, and deferred or canceled payments of insurance premiums may negatively affect our earnings and capitalization.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nInterest rate increases may harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This may result in cash outflows requiring the sale of investments on less favorable terms, resulting in investment losses and reductions in net income. Reductions in net income may in turn harm our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for ex ample, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fix ed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fix ed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. We would recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities in net income upon a sale, an intent to sell, a determination it is more likely than not we will be required to sell, or if the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. During inflationary periods with rising interest rates, the value of fix ed income investments falls, which could increase realized and unrealized losses, resulting in additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.",

Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $149 million, or 2%, compared to 2023, as increases in premiums in Korea and Australia, as well as fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, were partially offset by a decrease in premiums from Japan's accident &amp; health and yendenominated life products.\n\n",

      "question": "By how much did the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and market factors together reduce MetLife's adjusted earnings available to common shareholders in 2022, and which specific segment was primarily responsible for the foreign currency effect?",
      "answer": "The impact of foreign currency fluctuations and market factors together reduced MetLife's adjusted earnings available to common shareholders by $3.22 billion in 2022. Specifically, foreign currency fluctuations decreased adjusted earnings by $220 million, primarily affecting the Asia segment, while market factors, including lower returns on private equity and hedge funds, decreased adjusted earnings by $3.0 billion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the total decrease in adjusted earnings due to foreign currency and market factors: $220 million (foreign currency) + $3.0 billion (market factors) = $3.22 billion.",
        "Step 2: Identify the specific segment affected by foreign currency fluctuations from evidence_source_b: the Asia segment.",
        "Step 3: Confirm the relevance of these figures to the overall adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, as shown in evidence_source_a, which reports a total of $7,903 million for this metric."

      "answer": "The cumulative gross unrealized gains increased by $31 million, from $1,137 million in 2022 to $1,168 million in 2023. Additionally, the net unrealized gain position decreased from $1,006 million in 2022 ($1,137M - $131M) to $885 million in 2023 ($1,168M - $283M). This $121 million decline in net unrealized gains suggests that, despite an increase in gross gains, the investment portfolio was negatively impacted by a significant rise in unrealized losses and impairments during the period.",

Since PayPal's transaction revenues are directly impacted by TPV (Total Payment Volume), which is correlated with the number of payment transactions and fees earned, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of TPV in USD terms.

This  contract  matured  in  2020.  Gains  and  losses  associated  with  this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated.\n\nAdditionally,  in  connection  with  transactions  occurring  in  multiple  currencies  on  our  payments  platform,  we  generally  set  our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when  transactions  occur.  Given  that  we  also  have  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  on  our  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  our  subsidiaries,  we  have  an  additional  foreign  currency  exchange  exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other  income  (expense),  net,  and  are  offset  by  the  gains  and  losses  on  the  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts.

A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third party's login credentials, including entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account.

      "answer": "The decline in TPV from eBay's marketplace platform in 2021 was expected to negatively impact PayPal's revenue growth trends in the first half of 2022. However, this was offset in 2021 by strong growth in TPV and payment transactions driven primarily by Braintree and core PayPal products, as well as Venmo. Transaction revenues grew by $3.5 billion, or 17%, in 2021 due to these factors and the recovery of the travel and events verticals post-pandemic.",

These  factors favorably impacting growth in transaction revenues in 2021 were partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue we generate from eBay's marketplace platform, which we expect to continue, to a lesser extent, to negatively impact revenue growth trends in the first half of 2022.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we experienced an adverse impact on our TPV and transaction revenues due to the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

          "chunk_text": "- Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n- Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period,  divided  by  active  accounts  at  the  end  of  the  period.  The  number  of  payment  transactions  per  active account provides management with insight into the average number of times a customer account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period.\n- TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated  with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments  platform,  management  uses  these  metrics  to  gain  insights  into  the  scale  and  strength  of  our  payments  platform,  the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors' evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\n\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically  developed  or  acquired  through  business  combinations. While  the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction  revenues :  Net  transaction  fees  primarily  charged  to  merchants  on  a  transaction  basis  based  on  the  TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable  on  our  payments  platform.  We  earn  additional  fees  from  merchants  and  consumers  on  transactions  where  we perform  currency  conversion,  where  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the  merchant  and consumer  are  in  different  countries),  to  facilitate  the  instant  transfer  of  funds  for  our  customers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account  to  their  debit  card  or  bank  account,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues  from  other  value  added  services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues  from  interest  and  fees  earned  on  our  portfolio  of  loans  receivable,  and  interest  earned  on  certain  assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that impact our revenue.",

      "question": "How did the $136 million in VE territory covered losses incurred during fiscal 2023 impact the 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' account balance, and what specific mechanism was used to adjust for these losses as outlined in the litigation management deed?",
      "answer": "The $136 million in VE territory covered losses incurred during fiscal 2023 increased the negative balance of the 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' account from $35 million as of September 30, 2022, to $140 million as of September 30, 2023. This adjustment was made through a reduction in the conversion rate applicable to the series B and C preferred stock, as outlined in the litigation management deed. Specifically, the Company recorded the losses in the contra-equity account 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses,' which represents Visa\u2019s right to recover such losses via future adjustments to the preferred stock conversion rate. These adjustments may occur once every six months, unless a single loss exceeds \u20ac20 million, in which case the adjustment can happen immediately.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' account increased from $35 million (as of September 30, 2022) to $140 million (as of September 30, 2023), due to $136 million in losses incurred during the year.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, the litigation management deed allows the Company to recover these losses by adjusting the conversion rate of the series B and C preferred stock, which reduces the as-converted value of the preferred stock and thus transfers the financial burden of the losses to preferred stockholders.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 The $136 million in losses directly caused the increase in the negative balance of the 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' account, and the mechanism for recovery is explicitly the conversion rate adjustment as governed by the litigation management deed."

      "question": "How did the $2.7 billion as-converted value release tied to the eighth anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition impact both the series A preferred stock issuance and the preferred stock balances in Visa's equity table, and through what mechanism was this adjustment reflected in the company's stockholders' equity?",
      "answer": "The $2.7 billion as-converted value release triggered the issuance of 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024, which is reflected in the reduction of series B and C preferred stock balances and the corresponding adjustment in the preferred stock amount from $1,698 million to $1,031 million in Visa's equity table. This adjustment mechanism, governed by the litigation management deed, allowed Visa to recover VE territory covered losses by modifying the conversion rates of preferred stock, which in turn reduced the book value of series B and C preferred stock while increasing series A preferred stock balances. The issuance of series A preferred stock also carried an automatic conversion right into class A common stock upon eligible sale, further linking litigation-driven equity adjustments to future capital structure changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - The $2.7 billion as-converted value was released from series B and C preferred stock following the eighth anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition, resulting in the issuance of 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - The preferred stock balance decreased from $1,698 million to $1,031 million between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, aligning with the equity adjustments described in the litigation management deed.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The litigation management deed (evidence_source_b) explains the procedural link between the value release and the stock issuance, while the equity table (evidence_source_a) shows the financial impact of this adjustment on preferred stock balances.",
        "Step 4: Connect mechanism - The adjustment mechanism is explicitly described in evidence_source_b, where the as-converted value of preferred stock is used to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic conversion rate adjustments, which directly affects the book value of preferred stock shown in the equity table (evidence_source_a)."

This recovery also contributed $31 million toward the right to recover for covered losses, which helped offset the $136 million in VE territory covered losses incurred during the year.

      "answer": "The introduction of the October 1, 2029 cliff vesting date with a significant allocation of 500,440 awards in 2024, compared to no such awards in 2023 and 2022, indicates that BlackRock implemented a new long-term incentive structure aimed at retaining key talent through a more distant horizon. This contrasts with prior years where cliff vesting awards were aligned with January 31 vesting dates, suggesting a strategic shift toward extending retention incentives beyond the typical annual or three-year vesting cycles.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - In 2024, 500,440 awards were granted with a cliff vesting date of October 1, 2029, which was not present in prior years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023 and 2022, cliff vesting awards were tied to January 31, 2026 and January 31, 2025, respectively, with no mention of the October 1, 2029 date.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The absence of the October 1, 2029 cliff vesting in previous years and its significant allocation in 2024 signals a new long-term retention mechanism, indicating a strategic change in how BlackRock structures equity incentives."

The Combined LTV ratio considers all lien positions and unused lines related to the property, which is essential for evaluating the risk in junior lien products. According to the credit quality section, high Combined LTV ratios are associated with higher delinquency rates, indicating a reduced willingness of borrowers to continue making payments when they have little equity in the property.

Loans that are more than 30 days past due prov ide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans v ary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\n- For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss sev erity in the ev ent of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can prov ide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also prov ides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific ev ents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower's current or 'refreshed' FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n- For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution prov ides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activ ity and ev ents.",

The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect mov ements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cov er interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which conv erts the loan to a v ariable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniv ersary date triggers.\n\n## Prime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptiv e requirements related to income and ov erall debt lev els.

The impact on the sensitiv ities of the Treasury and CIO balance sheet actions were largely offset by the impact of deposits, primarily from the second quarter of 2024 update of the deposit rates paid assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale deposit products. Additionally, the results as of December 31, 2024 reflected the update to include hedges of the Firm's non-U.S. dollar capital inv estments. Although total results were not impacted, these hedges increase U.S. dollar sensitiv ities and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitiv ities.

      "answer": "The $148 million increase in interest expense on 'Payables to brokerage clients' in 2023, primarily driven by a $188 million increase due to higher interest rates, contributed to the broader $1.3 billion decrease in net interest revenue. This occurred as clients reallocated cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions due to rising market interest rates, which reduced average interest-earning assets by 21%. The decline in asset levels, combined with increased reliance on higher-cost supplemental funding sources like FHLB borrowings and brokered CDs, further compressed net interest revenue despite higher yields on remaining assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Net interest revenue decreased $1.3 billion (12%) in 2023, primarily due to increased utilization of higher-cost supplemental funding sources and lower average interest-earning assets (21% decrease), which was driven by clients allocating cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Interest expense on 'Payables to brokerage clients' increased $148 million in 2023, of which $188 million was due to higher average rates, partially offset by a $40 million decrease from lower average volumes.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $148 million increase in interest expense on payables to brokerage clients was part of a broader trend of rising funding costs (including FHLB borrowings and brokered CDs) driven by higher market rates. This, combined with reduced asset levels from client behavior, led to the $1.3 billion drop in net interest revenue."

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we understand that payables to brokerage clients are a component of interest-earning assets and that their average balances increased in 2022 due to net new client asset inflows and transfers of BDA balances to Schwab's balance sheet.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we see a detailed breakdown of the change in net interest revenue. Specifically, the section on 'Interest-bearing sources of funds' indicates that payables to brokerage clients contributed $113 million to the overall net interest revenue increase in 2022 compared to 2021.",
        "Step 3: By connecting these two pieces of information, we can determine that the increase in payables to brokerage clients directly contributed $113 million to the net interest revenue growth."

      "question": "How does the 2023 IDA agreement impact Schwab's bank deposit account fee revenue in the context of rising interest rates and client reallocation of assets?",
      "answer": "The 2023 IDA agreement limits Schwab's ability to respond to rising interest rates and reduces bank deposit account fee revenue because client reallocation of assets out of bank deposit account balances and into higher-yielding investment alternatives has decreased the amount of cash swept to TD Depository Institutions, which is the source of the fee revenue. Additionally, the agreement requires Schwab to maintain prescribed minimum and maximum IDA balances, restricting its flexibility to move balances to its own banking subsidiaries unless sufficient capital is available.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Schwab earns bank deposit account fee revenue through the 2023 IDA agreement with TD Depository Institutions, and rising interest rates have caused clients to reallocate assets out of bank deposit account balances into higher-yielding alternatives, reducing the cash swept to TD and thus reducing fee revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Schwab's forward-looking statements include the impact of changes in interest rates on bank deposit account fee revenue and the migration of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which is constrained by capital availability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 2023 IDA agreement directly influences Schwab's bank deposit account fee revenue, but the combination of rising interest rates and client behavior has reduced this revenue stream. Schwab is limited in its ability to adjust due to the structure of the IDA agreement and capital constraints."

      "question": "How did the change in Payables to Brokerage Clients from 2022 to 2023 impact Schwab's net interest revenue, considering both the dollar change in the payables and the change in interest costs associated with this liability?",
      "answer": "The Payables to Brokerage Clients decreased by $15.6 billion (from -$28,233 million in 2022 to -$12,652 million in 2023), indicating a reduction in client credit balances. This decrease contributed to a $40 million decline in interest costs in 2023 compared to 2022. However, the average interest rate on these payables increased, leading to a net $148 million increase in interest expense related to this liability. This combination of lower balances but higher rates resulted in a net upward pressure on Schwab's interest costs despite holding less client payable funds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract the Payables to Brokerage Clients line item: -$12,652 million in 2023 and -$28,233 million in 2022, showing a $15,581 million increase (i.e., a smaller negative value).",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract the 'Payables to brokerage clients' interest cost change: $148 million increase in interest expense due to changes in average volume (-$40 million) and average rate (+$188 million).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $15.6 billion reduction in client payables would typically reduce interest costs, but the $188 million rate-driven increase overwhelmed this volume effect, leading to a net $148 million higher interest cost in 2023."

      "question": "How much of the increase in the 90+ days past due delinquency rate in USPB and Mexico Consumer was driven by macroeconomic pressures and post-pandemic normalization, and how does this compare to the delinquency trends in Wealth, given the respective credit loss contributions of Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB versus credit card loans in Mexico Consumer?",
      "answer": "The 90+ days past due delinquency rate in USPB increased year-over-year due to macroeconomic pressures from elevated inflation and interest rates, particularly affecting lower FICO band customers, and was also influenced by the delayed maturation of recent loan vintages caused by pandemic stimulus. Similarly, in Mexico Consumer, the delinquency rate rose due to the normalization of post-pandemic lows.

          "chunk_text": "Excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, expenses of $53.5 billion also decreased 2%.\n\n## Cost of Credit\n\nCiti's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was $10.1 billion, compared to $9.2 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services in USPB , reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was due to macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both card portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. The higher net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL), primarily due to a smaller build related to transfer risk associated with ex posures outside the U.S. (approx imately $0.2 billion in 2024 versus $1.9 billion in 2023), driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. For additional information on Citi's ACL, see 'Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Citi's Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)' below.\n\nNet credit losses of $9.0 billion increased 40% from the prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $8.6 billion increased 39%, largely reflecting the continued rise in net credit loss rates in Branded Cards and Retail Services. Corporate net credit losses increased to $397 million from $250 million in the prior year.\n\nSubject to evolving macroeconomic conditions, Citi expects to continue to experience an elevated net credit loss rate for full-year 2025 in line with 2024, with higher loss rates in the first half of the year in Branded Cards and Retail Services consistent with seasonal patterns. Citi also expects that its future ACL builds will be driven by both the macroeconomic environment and business volumes, among other factors. For additional information on Citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and 'Credit Risk' below.\n\nIn January 2025, a series of wildfires affected the Los Angeles metropolitan area and surrounding regions, causing loss of life and the destruction of more than 16,000 structures. While Citi continues to assess the wildfires' impact on its customers and clients in the affected areas, Citi does not currently ex pect the wildfires to have a direct material impact to its consumer or corporate credit portfolios or its overall results of operations.\n\n## Capital\n\nCitigroup's CET1 Capital ratio was 13.6% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 13.4% as of December 31, 2023, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by net income and a decrease in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends, as well as common share repurchases and net adverse movements in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) .\n\nIn 2024, Citi repurchased $2.5 billion of common shares and paid $4.2 billion of common dividends (see 'Unregistered\n\nSales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends' below).\n\nFor additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see 'Capital Resources-Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' and 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks,' '-Operational Risks' and '-Compliance Risks' below.\n\nCitigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of\n\nDecember 31, 2024 was 5.8%, largely unchanged from December 31, 2023, as higher Tier 1 Capital was offset by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, see 'Capital Resources' below.\n\n## Services\n\nServices net income of $6.5 billion increased 40%, as higher revenue and lower cost of credit were partially offset by higher ex penses.\n\nServices revenues of $19.6 billion increased 9%, largely driven by a 28% increase in noninterest revenue and higher net interest income (up 1%). Excluding the impact of the Argentina currency devaluation ($(178) million in 2024 versus approximately $(1.2) billion in 2023), Services revenues increased 3% and its non-interest revenue increased 5%. The increase in net interest income reflected the benefit of higher deposit and loan volumes, largely offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina.\n\nTTS revenues of $14.5 billion increased 6% on a reported basis, driven by a 37% increase in non-interest revenue, partially offset by a 1% decrease in net interest income. Ex cluding the impact of the Argentina currency devaluation (approximately $(164) million in 2024 and approximately $(1.0) billion in 2023), non-interest revenue increased 3%, driven by an increase in cross-border transaction value, as well as an increase in U.S. dollar clearing and commercial card spend volume. The decrease in TTS net interest income was primarily driven by the decline in interest rates in Argentina.\n\nSecurities Services revenues of $5.1 billion increased 17%, driven by an 18% increase in noninterest revenue and a 15% increase in net interest income. The growth in non-interest revenue was primarily due to increased fees from higher AUC/AUA balances and continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services, as well as the smaller impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher spreads and volumes.\n\nServices expenses of $10.6 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology and platform modernization, other risk and controls and product innovation, as well as an Argentina-related transaction tax expense and higher legal expenses, partially offset by the impact of productivity savings. Cost of credit decreased to $276 million from $950 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a smaller ACL build for transfer risk associated with ex posures outside of the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

          "chunk_text": "## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims  represent  the notional  amount  of  repurchase  claims  made  by  counterparties,  typically  the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2.1 billion and $5.4 billion. These balances included $837 million and $2.2 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation  owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.\n\nDuring 202 4, the Corporation received $181 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2024, $3.5 billion in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $184 million and $604 million at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 and  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet,  and  the  related  provision  is  included  in  other  income  in  the Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  The  representations  and  warranties  reserve represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its  experience  in  previous  negotiations,  and  is  subject  to  jud gment,  a  variety  of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. At December 3 1, 202 4, the estimated  range  of  possible  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrued  representations  and warranties  reserve  was  not  significant.  F uture  representations  and  warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance F und (DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon V alley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected  from  certain  insured  depository  institutions,  including  the  Corporation, and  collection  began  during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  202 4.  As  of December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, the Corporation's accrual for its estimated share of the  FDIC  special  assessment  was  $1.7  billion  and  $2.1  billion.  The  Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC's estimated loss to the DIF , which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants  in  or  parties  to  many  pending  and  threatened  legal,  regulatory  and governmental  actions  and  proceedings.  In  view  of  the  inherent  difficulty  of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve  a  large  number  of  parties,  the  Corporation  generally  cannot  predict  the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below , whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods.

          "chunk_text": "## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims  represent  the notional  amount  of  repurchase  claims  made  by  counterparties,  typically  the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2.1 billion and $5.4 billion. These balances included $837 million and $2.2 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation  owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.\n\nDuring 202 4, the Corporation received $181 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2024, $3.5 billion in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $184 million and $604 million at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023 and  is  included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet,  and  the  related  provision  is  included  in  other  income  in  the Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  The  representations  and  warranties  reserve represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its  experience  in  previous  negotiations,  and  is  subject  to  jud gment,  a  variety  of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. At December 3 1, 202 4, the estimated  range  of  possible  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrued  representations  and warranties  reserve  was  not  significant.  F uture  representations  and  warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance F und (DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon V alley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected  from  certain  insured  depository  institutions,  including  the  Corporation, and  collection  began  during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  202 4.  As  of December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023, the Corporation's accrual for its estimated share of the  FDIC  special  assessment  was  $1.7  billion  and  $2.1  billion.  The  Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC's estimated loss to the DIF , which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants  in  or  parties  to  many  pending  and  threatened  legal,  regulatory  and governmental  actions  and  proceedings.  In  view  of  the  inherent  difficulty  of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve  a  large  number  of  parties,  the  Corporation  generally  cannot  predict  the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below , whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish  an  accrued  liability  and  record  a  corresponding  amount  of  litigationrelated  expense.  The  Corporation  continues  to  monitor  the  matter  for  further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously  established.  Excluding  expenses  of  internal  and  external  legal  service providers,  litigation  and   regulatory  investigation-related   expense  of  $266  million, $519  million  and  $1.2  billion  was  recognized  in  2024,  2023  and  2022, respectively.\n\nFor  any  matter  disclosed  in  this  Note  for  which  a  loss  in  future  period s  is reasonably  possible  and  estimable  (whether  in  excess  of  an  accrued  liability  or where there is no accrued liability), the Corporation's estimated range of possible loss  is  $0  to  $0.8  billion  in  excess  of  the  accrued  liability ,  if  any ,  as  of December 31, 2024.",

      "answer": "The dollar amount increase in BAC's legally binding commitments expiring in more than five years from December 31, 2023 ($39,077 million) to December 31, 2024 ($41,700 million) is $2,623 million. For commitments expiring in one year or less, the increase is $3,874 million, rising from $149,030 million in 2023 to $152,904 million in 2024.

Specifically, Global Banking originates deal-related transactions with corporate and commercial clients, which are executed and distributed by Global Markets. This collaboration necessitates a consolidated presentation of investment banking fees to provide a complete view of the Corporation's investment banking revenue. The evidence shows that the Corporation presents total investment banking fees and identifies the portion attributable to Global Banking, indicating that the fees generated from these shared activities are aggregated to reflect the overall performance of the Corporation's investment banking operations.",

      "answer": "The G-SIB capital surcharge of 3.0% directly increases the minimum external LTD requirement for the Parent Company. The LTD requirement is calculated as the greater of (i) total RWA multiplied by the sum of 6% plus the higher of Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB surcharge (which is 3.0%), or (ii) 4.5% of total leverage exposure. Since the G-SIB surcharge is 3.0%, this results in a minimum LTD requirement of either (6% + 3.0%) \u00d7 total RWA = 9% \u00d7 total RWA, or 4.5% of total leverage exposure, whichever is higher. The TLAC requirement remains at the greater of 18% of total RWA or 7.5% of total leverage exposure and is not directly affected by the G-SIB surcharge itself.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 3.0% G-SIB surcharge is explicitly added to the 6% base in the LTD requirement formula, raising the threshold to 9% of total RWA. This directly increases the required amount of eligible long-term debt the company must maintain."

      "answer": "The CECL deferral was 50% phased-in as of January 1, 2023, which temporarily reduced the capital impact of adopting CECL. Under the Standardized Approach, the capital buffer requirement was 8.4% in 2023, whereas under the Advanced Approach, it was lower at 5.5%. Since the Standardized Approach applies prescribed risk weights and does not rely on internal models, the CECL deferral has a more noticeable effect on capital ratios under this framework. This difference implies that Morgan Stanley has greater capital flexibility under the Advanced Approach in 2023, as it faces a lower effective capital buffer requirement and is less affected by the CECL transition.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The CECL deferral has a more pronounced effect on the Standardized Approach, where risk weights are not modeled, resulting in a higher capital buffer requirement compared to the Advanced Approach. This creates a difference in capital flexibility between the two regulatory frameworks."

      "question": "How did CIB's involvement with VIEs and its deposit attrition in 2023 influence JPMorgan's overall liquidity risk and consolidated financial exposure?",
      "answer": "CIB's involvement with VIEs included investing in and providing financing to third-party-sponsored VIEs, which increased JPMorgan's potential financial exposure due to the Firm's variable interests and risk of absorbing losses. Additionally, CIB experienced deposit attrition in 2023, which, despite being partially offset by net issuances of structured notes, contributed to a decline in average deposits. This reduction in stable funding sources increased JPMorgan's reliance on potentially less stable wholesale funding, thereby heightening liquidity risk. The combination of increased exposure to VIEs and reduced deposit stability created a dual impact on JPMorgan's liquidity and financial risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, CIB invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, which exposes JPM to potential losses and variable interests.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, CIB saw a decline in average deposits due to deposit attrition in 2023, partially offset by structured note issuances, indicating reduced stable funding.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - CIB's VIE-related activities increased JPM's financial exposure, while deposit attrition reduced stable liquidity, both of which negatively impacted JPM's liquidity risk and consolidated financial position."

      "answer": "Deposit attrition in AWM, CB, and CIB led to declines in JPMorgan Chase's overall deposit balances during 2023. Specifically, AWM experienced outflows due to client migration into higher-yielding investments, CB saw continued deposit attrition as clients sought better returns, and CIB faced deposit reductions, partially offset by structured note issuances.

      "answer": "The decline in CIB deposits, driven by deposit attrition and partially offset by structured note issuances, likely constrained CIB\u2019s liquidity position, which is critical for its predominant business activities of market-making and loan origination. These activities expose CIB to significant market risks such as adverse movements in interest rates, foreign exchange, credit, and equity instruments. To manage these risks, JPM includes a range of positions in its risk management framework for CIB, including trading assets and liabilities (debt and equity instruments), derivatives, securities purchased under resale agreements, and fair value option elected loans and liabilities. The reduction in stable funding sources like deposits may increase CIB\u2019s reliance on wholesale funding, which could amplify its exposure to structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks, especially given the sensitivity of its trading book and loan portfolio to market volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, we learn that CIB experienced a decline in deposits due to deposit attrition, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, we understand that CIB's business involves market-making across fixed income, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities, and that it originates loans and takes deposits.",
        "Step 3: Also from evidence_source_a, we see that CIB\u2019s risk management includes tracking trading assets/liabilities, derivatives, and fair value option elected instruments, which are sensitive to market price fluctuations.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize: The decline in deposits (source_b) likely affects CIB\u2019s ability to fund its market-making and loan origination activities (source_a), which in turn increases its exposure to the market risks managed through the listed positions (source_a)."

      "answer": "The customer collateral increased from $2,260 million in 2021 to $2,342 million in 2022, representing an increase of $82 million. This increase contributed to the growth in total current assets, which rose from $27,607 million in 2021 to $30,205 million in 2022, an increase of $2,598 million.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's Trading Revenues are significantly influenced by its market-making and OTC derivative activities, which require holding inventory and managing liquidity to facilitate client activity. The firm's reliance on long-term borrowings, which totaled $289 billion at December 31, 2024, helps reduce dependence on short-term credit-sensitive instruments and supports these trading activities. However, its credit ratings \u2014 a factor in the cost and availability of financing \u2014 can negatively impact Trading Revenues, especially in businesses like OTC derivatives where counterparty performance over the long term is critical. Therefore, a downgrade in credit ratings or increased borrowing costs could reduce profitability in these Trading Revenue-dependent segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Trading Revenues are driven by market-making activities, including gains and losses on inventory and OTC derivatives, which are sensitive to financing costs and liquidity.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Morgan Stanley had $289 billion in borrowings at year-end 2024, with long-term borrowings used to reduce reliance on short-term financing and support daily operations, including trading.",
        "Step 3: Evidence_source_b also states that credit ratings affect financing costs and can negatively impact Trading Revenues in businesses involving long-term counterparty performance, such as OTC derivatives.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The firm's Trading Revenues are sensitive to its ability to finance market-making and derivative activities. A reliance on long-term borrowings helps stabilize this funding, but any deterioration in credit ratings or increase in borrowing costs can directly and negatively impact Trading Revenues."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Institutional Securities-Fixed Income and E quities\n\nFixed income and Equities net revenues are composed of Trading revenues, Commissions and fees, Asset management revenues, Net interest, and certain Investments  and  Other  revenues  directly  attributable  to  those  businesses. These revenues, which can be affected by a variety  of  interrelated  factors, including  market  volumes,  bid-offer  spreads  and  the  impact  of  market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity, as well as the effect of hedging activity, are viewed in the aggregate when assessing the performance and profitability of our businesses.\n\nFollowing  is  a  description  of  the  revenue-generating  activities  within  our equity and fixed income businesses, as well as how their results impact the income statement line items.\n\nEquity-Financing. We  provide financing, prime brokerage and fund administration services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products, including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results  from  this  business  are  largely  driven  by  the  difference  between financing income earned and financing and liquidity costs incurred, which are reflected  in  Net  interest  for  securities  lending  products,  and  in  Trading revenues  for  derivative  products.  Fees  for  providing  fund  administration services are reflected in Asset management revenues.\n\nEquity-Execution  services. A  significant  portion  of  the  results  for  this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges, as well as from OTC  transactions.  We  make  markets  for  our  clients  principally  in  equityrelated  securities  and  derivative  products,  including  those  that  provide liquidity and are utilized for hedging. Market-making also generates gains and losses  on  inventory  held  to  facilitate  client  activity,  which  are  reflected  in Trading revenues. Execution services also includes certain Investments and Other revenues.\n\nFixed Income -Within  fixed  income,  we  make  markets  in  various  flow  and structured products in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services:\n\n- Global macro products. We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities and derivative instruments. The results of this marketmaking activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling  positions  to  stand  ready  for  and  satisfy  client  demand  and  are recorded in Trading revenues.\n- Credit products. We  make  markets  in  credit-sensitive  products,  such  as corporate  bonds  and  mortgage  securities  and  other  securitized  products, and related derivative instruments. The values of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains  and  losses  reflected  in  Trading  revenues.  We  undertake  lending activities,  which  include  commercial  mortgage  lending,  secured  lending facilities and financing ex tended to sales and trading customers. Due\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\n- to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.\n- Commodities products and Other. We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and metals. These activities are primarily recorded in Trading revenues.\n\nFixed income also includes certain Investments and Other revenues.\n\n## Institutional Securities-Other Net Revenues\n\nOther net revenues include impacts from certain treasury functions, such as liquidity and funding costs and gains and losses on economic hedges related to certain borrowings. Other net revenues also include mark-to-market gains and losses on held-for-sale corporate loans and lending commitments, as well as net interest and gain and losses on economic hedges associated with heldfor-sale  and  held-for-investment  corporate  loans  and  lending  commitments. Also  included  are  gains  and  losses  from  financial  instruments  used  to economically hedge compensation expense related to certain DCP, income and losses from the equity method investment related to our Japanese securities joint venture with MUFG, as well as Investments and Other revenues that are not directly attributable to Fix ed income and Equities businesses.\n\n## Compensation Expense\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses include base salaries and fix ed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in the fair value of DCP  investments,  carried  interest  allocated  to  employees,  severance  costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. For additional information on DCP, refer to 'Other Matters' herein.\n\nThe factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from period to period, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenueproducing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for other employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment and employees in corporate support  functions,  include  base  salary  and  benefits  and  may  also  include incentive  compensation  that  is  determined  following  the  assessment  of  the performance of the Firm, business unit and individual.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business  segment.  Certain  items  have  been  allocated  to  each  business segment,  generally  in  proportion  to  its  respective  net  revenues  or  other relevant measures.",

For borrow ings w ith put options, maturity represents the earliest put date.\n\nBorrowings  of  $289  billion  at  December  31,  2024  increased  when  compared with  $264  billion  at  December  31,  2023,  primarily  due  to  issuances  net  of maturities and redemptions.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nWe  believe  that  accessing  debt  investors  through  multiple  distribution channels  helps  provide  consistent  access  to  the  unsecured  markets.  In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings  with  original  maturities  greater  than  one  year  are  generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.\n\nThe availability  and  cost  of  financing  to  us  can  vary  depending  on  market conditions,  the  volume  of  certain  trading  and  lending  activities,  our  credit ratings  and  the  overall  availability  of  credit.  We  also  engage  in,  and  may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our marketmaking activities.\n\nFor further information on Borrowings, see Note 13 to the financial statements.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nWe  rely  on  external  sources  to  finance  a  significant  portion  of  our  daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in  those  businesses  where  longer-term  counterparty  performance  is  a  key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industrywide factors. See also 'Risk Factors-Liquidity Risk.'\n\n## Parent Company and U .S.

Other  assets  primarily  includes  premises,  equipment  and  softw are,  ROU  assets  related  to leases, other investments and deferred tax assets.\n\nA substantial portion of total assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, liquid  marketable  securities  and  short-term  receivables.  In  the  Institutional Securities  business  segment,  these  arise  from  market-making,  financing  and prime brokerage activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management Framework\n\nThe primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that  we  have  access  to  adequate  funding  across  a  wide  range  of  market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies.\n\nThe following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:\n\n- Sufficient  liquidity  resources,  which  consist  of  HQLA  and  cash  deposits with banks ('Liquidity Resources') should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;\n- Maturity  profile  of  assets  and  liabilities  should  be  aligned,  with  limited reliance on short-term funding;\n- Source,  counterparty,  currency,  region  and  term  of  funding  should  be diversified; and\n- Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.\n\nThe core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile.\n\n## Required Liquidity Framework\n\nOur Required Liquidity Framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required  Liquidity  Framework  considers  the  most  constraining  liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Tests\n\nWe use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.\n\nThe assumptions used in our various Liquidity Stress Test scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- No government support;\n- No access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets;\n- Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;\n- Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;\n- Additional  collateral  that  would  be  required  by  trading  counterparties, certain exchanges  and  clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;\n- Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;\n- Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;\n- Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties; and\n- Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions.\n\nLiquidity Stress Tests are produced and results are reported at different levels, including  major  operating  subsidiaries  and  major  currencies,  to  capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment.

We have direct exposure to market risk. In addition, market risk may also impact our clients and markets in a manner that may indirectly impact us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk-Market Risk.'\n\n## Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors.\n\nOur results  of  operations  have  been  in  the  past  and  may,  in  the  future,  be materially  affected  by  global  financial  market  and  economic  conditions, including, in particular, by periods of low or slowing economic growth in the United  States and other major markets, both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels. These include the level and volatility of equity,  fix ed  income  and  commodity  prices;  the  level,  term  structure  and volatility of interest rates; inflation, currency values and unemployment rates; the  level  of  other  market  indices,  fiscal  or  monetary  policies  established  by governments, central banks and financial regulators; and uncertainty concerning  the  future  path  of  interest  rates,  government  shutdowns,  debt ceilings or funding, which may be driven by economic conditions, recessionary fears, market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related incidents, acts of war or aggression, geopolitical  instability,  changes  as  a  result  of  global  elections,  including changes in U.S. presidential administrations or Congress, changes to global trade policies, supply chain complications and the implementation of tariffs, protectionist  trade  policies,  trade  sanctions  or  investment  restrictions  and other factors, or a combination of these or other factors.\n\nThe  results  of  our  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity  and  in  the  fair  value  of  securities  and  other  financial  products. Fluctuations  also  occur  due  to  the  level  of  global  market  activity,  which, among other things, can  be  impacted  by  market  uncertainty  or  lack  of  investor  and  client confidence due to unforeseen economic, geopolitical or market conditions that in  turn  affect  the  size,  number  and  timing  of  investment  banking  client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, including equity market levels and the level and pace of changes in interest rates and asset valuation, may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets, including deposits. This could also impact the level of net new asset flows and/or  flows  into  fee-based  assets. Any  of  these  factors  could  negatively impact the results of our Wealth Management business segment.\n\nSubstantial market fluctuations or divergence in asset performance could also cause  variations  in  the  value  of  our  investments  in  our  funds,  the  flow  of investment capital into or from AUM, and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which  could  negatively  impact  the  results  of  our  Investment  Management business segment.\n\nThe value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets  may  make  it  difficult  to  value  and  monetize  certain  of  our  financial instruments, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance-based income (also  known  as  incentive  fees,  which  include  carried  interest)  in  respect  of certain  businesses.  In  addition,  at  the  time  of  any  sales  and  settlements  of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid  depreciation  in  asset  values  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly ex posed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses. Although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk  to  more  ex treme  market  moves,  severe  market  events  have  historically been  difficult  to  predict,  and  we  could  realize  significant  losses  if  ex treme market events were to occur.",

This sensitivity to valuation changes\u2014driven by both observable and unobservable inputs\u2014can lead to volatility in reported trading revenues. At the same time, the firm increased its borrowings from $264 billion to $289 billion, reflecting a strategy of issuing debt with maturities greater than one year to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments and mitigate refinancing risk. This borrowing strategy supports the firm's broader trading and financing activities, especially in businesses where counterparty performance and credit ratings are key considerations, such as in OTC derivatives.

This indicates a shift in the firm's capital structure and financing approach.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in borrowings supports the firm's trading and lending activities, which in turn influence the volatility and magnitude of Trading revenues, especially in businesses like OTC derivatives where long-term counterparty performance is critical."

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's Trading revenues are directly impacted by the fair value of OTC financial instruments, including derivatives related to financial instruments and commodities. These revenues are sensitive to market fluctuations and can lead to earnings volatility. The firm's credit ratings, which are a key factor in the cost and availability of financing, are influenced by both company-specific and industry-wide factors, including the performance of longer-term counterparty transactions such as OTC derivatives. As the firm increases long-term borrowings (e.g., from $264 billion in 2023 to $289 billion in 2024) to reduce reliance on short-term instruments and mitigate refinancing risk, any downgrade in credit ratings\u2014potentially triggered by volatile trading performance\u2014could raise borrowing costs and limit access to debt markets.

When  the  Firm  earns  carried  interest  from  funds  as  specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited  partner  interest  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting and measured based on the Firm's claim on the NAV  of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. Such items are reflected within Investments revenues.\n\nSee Note 22 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. See Note 14 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.\n\n## Other Items\n\nRevenues  from  certain commodities-related contracts are recognized in Trading  revenues  when  the  Firm  has  transferred  control  over  the  promised goods or services to the customer.\n\nReceivables  from  contracts  with  customers  are  recognized  in  Customer  and other  receivables  in  the  balance  sheet  when  the  underlying  performance obligations have been satisfied and the Firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. Contract assets are recognized in Other assets when the Firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional on  something  other  than  the passage  of time. Contract liabilities are recognized  in  Other  liabilities  and  accrued  ex penses  when  the  Firm  has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.\n\nFor contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Revenues  are  not  discounted  when payment is expected within one year.\n\nThe  Firm  generally  presents,  net  within  revenues,  taxes  assessed  by  a governmental  authority  that  are  both  imposed  on  and  concurrent  with  a specific  revenue-producing  transaction  and  collected  by  the  Firm  from  a customer.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of Cash and due from banks and interestbearing deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  also  include  Restricted  cash,  such  as  cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks, and the Firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nInstruments within Trading assets and Trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. These financial instruments  primarily  represent  the  Firm's  trading  and  investment  positions and  include  both  cash  and  derivative  products.  In  addition,  securities classified as Available-for-Sale ('AFS') are measured at fair value.\n\nGains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in Trading revenues,  Investments  revenues  or  Investment  banking  revenues  in  the income statement, except for gains and losses related to AFS securities (see 'AFS  Investment  Securities'  section  herein  and  Note  7)  and  derivatives accounted for as hedges, as well as economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments (see 'Hedge Accounting' and 'Other Hedges' herein and Note 6).\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statement depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. When interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair  value,  interest  is  recorded  within  Trading  revenues  or  Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is recorded within Interest income or Interest expense. Dividend  income  is  recorded  in  Trading  revenues  or  Investments  revenues depending on the business activity.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  OTC  financial  instruments,  including  derivative  contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. Additionally, the Firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.\n\n## Fair Value Option\n\nThe  Firm  has  elected  to  measure  certain  eligible  instruments  at  fair  value, including Securities purchased under agreements to resell, Loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, Deposits, Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Other secured financings and Borrowings.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement-Definition and Hierarchy\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e ., the 'ex it price') in",

The increase in borrowings to $289 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $264 billion in 2023, plays a role in this dynamic as it reflects a growing reliance on external financing.

These  include governance, capital adequacy, the level and quality of earnings, liquidity and funding,  risk  appetite  and  management,  asset  quality,  strategic  direction, business mix, regulatory or legislative changes, macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, and it is  possible  that  the  rating  agencies could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions.\n\nOur  credit  ratings  also  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  certain  trading revenues,  particularly  in  those  businesses  where  longer-term  counterparty performance  is  a  key  consideration,  such  as  OTC  and  other  derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated  with  our  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  we  may  be required to provide additional collateral to, or immediately settle  any outstanding  liability  balance  with,  certain  counterparties  in  the  event  of  a credit rating downgrade.\n\nTermination of our trading agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant  payments in  the  form  of  cash  or  securities.  The  additional collateral  or  termination  payments  that  may  occur  in  the  event  of  a  future credit  rating  downgrade  vary  by  contract  and  can  be  based  on  ratings  by Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.,  S&amp;P  G lobal  Ratings  and/or  other  rating agencies.  See  also  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations-Liquidity  and  Capital  ResourcesCredit Ratings-Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments.'\n\n## We are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.\n\nThe Parent Company has no business operations and depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments  and  to  fund  all  payments  on  its  obligations,  including  debt obligations.  Regulatory  restrictions,  tax   restrictions  or  elections  and  other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nsubsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations and  self-regulatory organization rules that, in certain circumstances, limit, as well as permit regulatory bodies to block or reduce, the flow  of  funds  to  the  Parent  Company,  or  that  prohibit  such  transfers  or dividends  altogether,  including  steps  to  'ring  fence'  entities  by  regulators outside the U.S. to protect clients and creditors of such entities.\n\nThese laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. Furthermore, as a BHC, we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends. The U.S. banking agencies have the authority, and under certain circumstances the duty, to prohibit  or  to  limit  the  payment  of  dividends  or other capital actions by the banking organizations they supervise, including us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. See 'We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements' under 'Legal, Regulatory  and Compliance Risk' herein.\n\n## Our  liquidity  and  financial  condition  have  in  the  past  been,  and  in  the future could be, adversely affected by U.S. and international markets and economic conditions.\n\nOur ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity markets, or to access secured lending markets, has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international markets and economies.\n\nIn particular, our cost and availability of funding in the past have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by illiquid credit markets, interest rates and wider credit spreads. Significant turbulence in the U.S., the E.U. and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk\n\nLegal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions; material financial loss, including fines, penalties,  judgments, damages and/or settlements; limitations on our business; or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk,  such  as  the  risk  that  a  counterparty's  performance  obligations  will  be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For more information on how we monitor and  manage  legal,  regulatory  and  compliance  risk,  see  'Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk-Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.'",

In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings  with  original  maturities  greater  than  one  year  are  generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.\n\nThe availability  and  cost  of  financing  to  us  can  vary  depending  on  market conditions,  the  volume  of  certain  trading  and  lending  activities,  our  credit ratings  and  the  overall  availability  of  credit.  We  also  engage  in,  and  may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our marketmaking activities.\n\nFor further information on Borrowings, see Note 13 to the financial statements.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nWe  rely  on  external  sources  to  finance  a  significant  portion  of  our  daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in  those  businesses  where  longer-term  counterparty  performance  is  a  key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industrywide factors. See also 'Risk Factors-Liquidity Risk.'\n\n## Parent Company and U .S.

T he Company considers these securities to be av ailable-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Inv estments with stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or inv estments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensiv e income (loss). The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gain or loss on the sale of securities, which is recorded in inv estment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned and included in inv estment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair v alue of a debt security below the  amortized  cost  basis,  the  Company  recognizes  an  impairment  in  inv estment  income  (expense)  and  other  on  the  consolidated  statements  of operations if it has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recov ery of the amortized cost basis. In addition, if the Company identifies that the decline in fair v alue has resulted from credit losses, the credit loss component is recognized  as  an  allowance  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  in inv estment  income  (expense)  and  other  on  the  consolidated  statements  of operations.  T he  non-credit  loss  component  remains  in  accumulated  other  comprehensiv e  income  (loss)  until  realized  from  a  sale  or  subsequent impairment.\n\nNon-marketable  equity  securities. T he  Company's  non-marketable  equity  securities,  which  are  reported  in  other  assets  on  the  consolidated balance sheets, include inv estments in priv ately held entities without readily determinable fair v alues. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in inv estment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe Company applies the equity method of accounting when it does not hav e control but has the ability to exercise significant influence ov er the entity.  Under the equity method, the Company's share of each entity's profit or loss is recognized in inv estment income (expense) and other on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe  Company applies  the  fair  v alue  measurement  alternativ e  for  equity  securities  in  certain  other  entities  when  it  does  not  hav e  the  ability  to exercise significant influence ov er the entity. T he Company adjusts the carrying v alue of these equity securities to fair v alue when orderly transactions for identical or similar inv estments of the same issuer are observ able.\n\nThe  Company  regularly  rev iews  inv estments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  and  the  fair  v alue  measurement  alternativ e  for  possible impairment, which generally inv olv es an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the inv estment, expectations of the entity's cash flows and capital needs, and the v iability of its business model.\n\nFinancial instruments .  T he Company considers the following to be financial instruments: cash, cash equiv alents, restricted cash, restricted cash equiv alents, inv estment securities, settlement receiv able and payable, accounts receiv able, customer collateral, non-marketable equity securities and deriv ativ e instruments. See Note 6-Fair Value Measurements and Investments.\n\nSettlement receivable and payable .  T he  Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the  Company's financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receiv able or payable balance. Settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, resulting in amounts due from and to clients. These amounts are presented as settlement receiv able and settlement payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCustomer collateral . The Company has cash deposits and other non-cash assets from certain clients in order to ensure that their performance of settlement obligations arising from Visa payment serv ices are processed in accordance with the Company's operating rules. The cash collateral assets held by the Company are restricted and",

      "answer": "Wells Fargo, as a large BHC, is subject to Basel III capital requirements and FRB-imposed capital distribution restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends. These restrictions are further constrained by limitations on the transfer of funds from its subsidiary banks, which are subject to federal laws that cap covered transactions with affiliates at 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate. This means that even if Wells Fargo as a parent company wanted to increase dividends, it would face dual constraints: regulatory capital requirements at the holding company level and statutory limits on how much capital can be drawn from its subsidiary banks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Wells Fargo is subject to Basel III and FRB capital distribution restrictions that limit dividend payments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring more than 10% of their capital and surplus to affiliates in covered transactions, with an aggregate cap of 20%.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of FRB-imposed capital distribution limits and statutory caps on affiliate transfers from subsidiary banks significantly constrains Wells Fargo\u2019s ability to fund dividends from its banking subsidiaries."

      "answer": "BNY Mellon\u2019s forward-looking statements emphasize its strategic focus on capital management, including capital return targets and intentions regarding share repurchases as part of its broader financial strategy. The company disclosed that share repurchases were executed through various mechanisms, including Rule 10b5-1 plans and structured transactions, as detailed in the 'Capital - Issuer purchases of equity securities' section. These mechanisms align with its stated objective of returning capital to shareholders while maintaining capital adequacy. The use of Rule 10b5-1 plans indicates a systematic and pre-determined approach to repurchasing shares, supporting the company\u2019s forward-looking commitment to optimizing its capital structure and enhancing shareholder value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BNY Mellon\u2019s forward-looking statements include intentions related to capital returns, including share repurchases, and are based on current beliefs and expectations about its financial and capital condition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BNY Mellon discloses that share repurchases may be executed through Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchase programs, and other structured transactions, as part of its capital return strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The company\u2019s stated capital return targets in the forward-looking guidance are directly linked to its actual repurchase mechanisms, such as Rule 10b5-1 plans, indicating a strategic and methodical approach to capital deployment."

      "answer": "The distribution of First Mortgages significantly impacts the composition of Total Residential Real Estate loans, particularly in the 5-15 year and over 15 year maturity ranges. From evidence_source_a, First Mortgages in the 5-15 year range amount to $1,177 (in millions), and in the over 15 year range amount to $26,142 (in millions). From evidence_source_b, the 5-15 year range for Total Residential Real Estate is $1,309 (in millions), and the over 15 year range is $26,472 (in millions). This shows that First Mortgages dominate both maturity ranges, representing 89.9% ($1,177 \u00f7 $1,309) of the 5-15 year range and 98.8% ($26,142 \u00f7 $26,472) of the over 15 year range. Therefore, the composition of Total Residential Real Estate loans is overwhelmingly driven by First Mortgages in these maturity buckets.",

        "Step 4: Conclude that First Mortgages are the dominant component of Total Residential Real Estate loans in both the 5-15 year and over 15 year maturity ranges."

      "answer": "The 3% increase in bank deposit account fees ($729M in 2024) was offset by a 17% decrease in average BDA balances ($86.8B in 2024 vs. $104.2B in 2023), which reduced the base on which fees were earned. This decline in average balances was driven by client shifts to higher-yielding alternatives like fixed income investments and proprietary money market funds, as noted in the risk factors. Additionally, Schwab utilized higher-cost supplemental funding sources to accommodate these shifts, which further negatively impacted net income despite the fee increase.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Although fees increased slightly, the significant drop in average BDA balances reduced the revenue-generating base. Schwab had to use more expensive funding sources to meet client demand, which cut into net income."

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Item 1A.     Risk Factors\n\nWe face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect our operations or financial results.\n\nFor a discussion of our risk management governance and processes, including operational risk, compliance risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II - Item 7. For additional information regarding cybersecurity risk, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Economic and Market Risks\n\n## Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.\n\nOur business can be adversely affected by the general environment - economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.\n\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and its own balance sheet management, are difficult to predict and can affect our financial results, including net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees, and the market value of our investment securities. These policies can have implications for clients' allocation to cash as we ex perienced in recent years, and higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements, as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden. Investor sentiment and market and trading dynamics can affect client preferences and security selection, and can impact transactions and asset-based revenues.\n\n## A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.\n\nWe rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment may be used to extend margin loans to clients or be swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash to the TD Depository Institutions pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, through which we earn bank deposit account fees. A significant reduction in our clients' allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, would likely reduce our income. As a result of the rapid increases in shortterm interest rates in 2022 and 2023, the Company saw a significant decrease in clients' asset allocation to sweep cash and greater client investment in higher-yielding alternatives at Schwab such as fixed income investments and proprietary purchased money market funds. To help facilitate these changes in client cash allocations, the Company utilized higher-cost supplemental funding sources, which negatively impacted the Company's net income.\n\n## Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.\n\nThe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. The Company's interest-earning assets include significant holdings of investment securities, which include fixed- and floatingrate debt securities, including substantial holdings of mortgage-backed securities, as well as mortgages. The Company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the Company earns on interest-earning assets decline more than the rates that the Company pays on its funding sources, or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage-backed securities that the Company holds. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees, as we experienced in 2020 and 2021, for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. A decline in interest rates may also negatively impact our bank deposit account fee revenue, which is earned primarily pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement.\n\nThough the Company may benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher-cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets, which can reduce the benefit of higher market interest rates to our net interest revenue, as we ex perienced in recent years. The rapid increases in market interest rates ex perienced in 2022 and 2023 also contributed to increased unrealized losses on our investment",
