      "answer": "The total change in 'Nonoperating income, other' for Duke Energy from 2021 to 2023 is a decrease of $81 million, calculated as $413 million in 2021 minus $332 million in 2023. For Duke Energy Progress, the change is a decrease of $43 million, calculated as $87 million in 2021 minus $44 million in 2023. This indicates that Duke Energy Progress experienced a significant portion (over half) of the overall decline in Duke Energy's 'Nonoperating income, other'.",

      "answer": "The total change in 'Other Income and Expense, Net' for Duke Energy from 2022 ($392 million) to 2023 ($598 million) is an increase of $206 million. The change in 'Nonoperating income, other' from $134 million in 2022 to $332 million in 2023 represents an increase of $198 million, and the change in 'Post-in-service equity returns' from $34 million in 2022 to $39 million in 2023 represents an increase of $5 million.

      "answer": "The $955 million loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter significantly contributed to the total annual loss of $1,455 million from discontinued operations, which directly reduced Duke Energy Corporation's Net Income (loss) for 2023 to $2,874 million. This is evident when comparing the quarterly Net Income (loss) figures: $761 million (Q1), $(204) million (Q2), $1,321 million (Q3), and $996 million (Q4), showing that the second quarter's loss disproportionately affected the annual result.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The $955 million loss in the second quarter is part of the total $1,455 million annual loss from discontinued operations.",

      "question": "How did the percentage distribution of residential sales across Duke Energy's operating segments in 2023 interact with the year-over-year decline in residential sales volumes to impact overall retail electricity demand?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy's residential sales were distributed across its operating segments as follows: Duke Energy Carolinas (32%), Progress (26%), Florida (50%), Ohio (37%), and Indiana (28%). Despite expected customer growth, residential sales volumes declined due to the return to post-pandemic norms and energy efficiency adoption, which reduced average usage per customer. This decline in residential usage, a key component of total retail sales (which collectively made up 85-98% across segments), placed downward pressure on overall electricity demand, even as industrial weakness and weather-normalized commercial growth offset some of the impact.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Residential sales percentages by segment (Carolinas 32%, Progress 26%, Florida 50%, Ohio 37%, Indiana 28%).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Residential sales decreased due to return to post-pandemic norms and energy efficiency adoption.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The high proportion of residential sales in total retail volumes (evident from the 85-98% retail share across segments) means that a decline in this category significantly affects overall demand, despite growth in other areas like data centers."

      "answer": "The lower results from Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups in 2023 contributed to a $132 million increase in the Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, compared to 2022. This is calculated from the $1,455 million loss in 2023 versus the $1,323 million loss in 2022, as directly attributed to the performance of the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

      "answer": "The triggering of the ROE band adjustment on July 25, 2022, led to an increase in the midpoint ROE from 9.85% to 10.10%, which directly influenced Duke Energy Florida's base rate increases. As a result, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on August 12, 2022, to increase the ROE effective August 2022, with a base rate increase effective January 1, 2023. The FPSC approved this request on October 4, 2022, allowing Duke Energy Florida to implement a $49 million base rate increase in 2023 and a planned $79 million increase in 2024, both of which were part of the original settlement but subject to adjustment due to tax reform or regulatory changes such as the ROE band trigger.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The ROE band was set at 8.85% to 10.85% with a midpoint of 9.85%, and it could increase by 25 basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increased by 50 basis points over six months.",

This disposal led to the segment being reported as discontinued operations starting in Q4 2022, and the sale was completed in October 2023 through agreements with affiliates of Brookfield and ArcLight, resulting in a restructuring of Duke Energy's business segments from three to two reportable segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&I).",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The variance in financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily driven by lower results from Duke Energy's Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups in the current year.",

      "answer": "The disposal of the Commercial Renewables segment resulted in a $1,457 million loss from discontinued operations in 2023, indicating that the segment was a financial burden to Duke Energy during the year. This loss was significantly higher than the $1,349 million in 2022 and $151 million in 2021, showing a worsening performance in 2023. The decision to sell the segment, announced in November 2022 and completed in October 2023, aligns with the increased loss in 2023 and suggests that Duke Energy sought to eliminate a financially underperforming unit to focus on more stable operations like Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.",

The noncontrolling interest balance related to this segment dropped from $1.6 billion in 2022 to $66.3 million by the end of 2023, indicating a substantial reduction in outside ownership stakes following the sales. The transactions with Brookfield (for utility-scale solar and wind) and ArcLight (for distributed generation) were completed in October 2023, effectively removing the majority of the Commercial Renewables business from Duke Energy\u2019s operations and shifting its financial performance to discontinued operations.

      "question": "What is the financial significance of the different timelines for implementing new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and how does the regulatory asset structure in Florida support Duke Energy's broader modernized ratemaking strategy across jurisdictions?",
      "answer": "The different timelines for implementing new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina reflect the complexity and staggered nature of Duke Energy's regulatory approvals, which directly affect cash flow and earnings. In North Carolina, Duke Energy Progress implemented revised Year 1 rates on October 1, 2023, following the August 2023 NCUC order approving the PBR Application. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas received a constructive order in December 2023 with new rates effective January 2024. In contrast, South Carolina\u2019s new rates went into effect on April 1, 2023, after the PSCSC final order on March 8, 2023. This staggered implementation creates a more gradual impact on revenue recognition across 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Florida\u2019s regulatory asset structure, as shown in the balance sheets, supports timely cost recovery through grid investment riders, which aligns with the broader strategy of achieving stable cash flows and earnings growth under modernized regulatory constructs across all jurisdictions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy Progress implemented revised Year 1 rates on October 1, 2023, and Duke Energy Carolinas received a constructive order in December 2023 with new rates effective January 2024 in North Carolina.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - South Carolina\u2019s new rates went into effect April 1, 2023, after the PSCSC issued a final written order on March 8, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Duke Energy Florida's regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, indicating the financial mechanisms supporting timely cost recovery.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The staggered implementation of new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina affects the timing of revenue recognition, while Florida\u2019s regulatory asset structure enables Duke Energy to maintain stable cash flows and earnings growth under modernized ratemaking frameworks across jurisdictions."

      "answer": "The $85 million increase in wholesale revenues from higher market demand directly supports Southern Company's ability to cover fixed costs and fund new infrastructure. However, because much of the demand increase is driven by uncertain long-term trends such as data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing, there is exposure to regulatory lag. If regulators do not allow timely rate adjustments to recover the costs of new generation and transmission assets built in response to this demand, Southern Company may not fully recover these costs, undermining the financial benefit of the revenue increase.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Wholesale revenues increased $85 million due to higher market demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Demand increases driven by data centers and EV manufacturing create uncertainty, and regulatory lag may prevent timely cost recovery.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While the $85 million revenue increase supports infrastructure investment, the uncertainty in demand and regulatory recovery mechanisms creates financial exposure."

          "chunk_text": "\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues increased $77 million, or 41.0%, as compared to 2023 largely due to increases of $85 million related to the volume of KWH sales associated with higher market demand and $76 million related to net additional capacity from wholesale capacity contracts, partially offset by a decrease of $89 million related to the average cost per KWH sold due to lower Southern Company system fuel and purchased power prices.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\nIn 2024, other operating revenues increased $171 million, or 24.2%, as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases of $76 million in unregulated sales primarily associated with power delivery construction and maintenance, energy conservation projects, and renewables, $40 million in open access transmission tariff sales, $29 million in regulated sales primarily associated with power delivery construction and maintenance, $23 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales, $8 million in pole attachment revenues, and $8 million in solar program fees, partially offset by a net increase of $17 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs.\n\n## Energy Sales\n\nChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2024 and the percent change from 2023 were as follows:\n\n",

In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.\n\n## A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.\n\nThere are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

      "answer": "The increase in demand for energy from data centers and industrial facilities has led Alabama Power to adjust its generation and purchasing mix. This resulted in a $59 million increase in fuel expenses due to higher natural gas and coal generation volumes. At the same time, purchased power expenses decreased by $54 million due to lower volumes purchased from both affiliates and non-affiliates, partly because of new generation availability. Since Alabama Power uses an energy cost recovery clause, these cost changes are generally offset by corresponding revenue adjustments. Therefore, while the total net expense impact is an increase of $5 million ($59M - $54M), this does not significantly affect earnings due to the cost recovery mechanism, which aligns energy expenses with energy revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(*) Average cost of purchased pow er includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Pow er for tolling agreements w here pow er is generated by the provider.\n\nFuel and purchased power expenses were $1.7 billion in 2024, a decrease of $71 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $54 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $17 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate ECR\" for additional information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense was $1.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $59 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 23.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, an 8.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 9.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by an 8.7% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which ex cludes tolling agreements, and a 7.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal.\n\n## Purchased Power -Non-Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $199 million in 2024, a decrease of $54 million, or 21.3%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 31.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation, partially offset by a 12.5% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Purchased Power -Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from affiliates was $175 million in 2024, a decrease of $76 million, or 30.3%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 42.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation and a reduction in capacity-related expenses due to lower capacity needs in 2024, partially offset by a 21.0% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.",

In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.\n\n## A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.\n\nThere are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

      "question": "How does the 30.8% decrease in KWH volume sold to non-affiliates and the uncertainty in future energy demand from data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing impact Alabama Power's ability to recover costs of new generation and transmission facilities, given the risk of regulatory lag?",
      "answer": "The 30.8% decrease in KWH volume sold to non-affiliates reduces Alabama Power's wholesale revenues, limiting the funds available to invest in new generation and transmission facilities. At the same time, uncertainty in future energy demand\u2014particularly from emerging sectors like data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing\u2014makes long-term planning and cost recovery riskier. Because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments, Alabama Power may face regulatory lag, where costs for new infrastructure are incurred but not immediately recoverable through rates. This combination of reduced current revenues and uncertain future cost recovery could hinder Alabama Power's ability to fund and justify new capital investments in generation and transmission infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Wholesale revenues from non-affiliates decreased by $87 million (20.5%) due to a 30.8% drop in KWH volume sold following the end of power sales agreements in May 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Future demand for energy is uncertain and increasingly driven by new sectors like data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing, which affects long-term planning and cost recovery for new generation and transmission facilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The drop in wholesale revenue limits near-term financial flexibility, while uncertain demand increases long-term capital spending risk. Regulatory lag could prevent timely rate recovery, making it harder to recoup these costs, thus threatening the financial viability of new infrastructure investments."

          "chunk_text": "\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $87 million, or 20.5%, as compared to 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a 30.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs sold as a result of power sales agreements that ended in May 2023.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nIn 2024, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $79 million, or 131.7%, as compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase of 165.5% in the volume of KWH sales due to affiliated company energy needs.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC.",

The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts.

      "question": "How does the increase in demand for energy driven by data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing impact Southern Company's purchased power expenses from affiliates and non-affiliates, given the changes in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 operations and the fluctuation in market prices?",
      "answer": "The increase in energy demand driven by data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing has necessitated additional power generation and transmission infrastructure. This has led Southern Company to rely more heavily on its own generation units, including Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which were placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively. As a result, purchased power expenses from affiliates decreased by $19 million (2.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a 6.3% drop in the volume of KWHs purchased, as internal generation became more favorable than market purchases. However, this internal reliance also increased depreciation and operations and maintenance expenses due to the new plant being placed in service. Meanwhile, purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the relative cost of wholesale energy compared to Southern Company's own generation, creating a dynamic where rising demand could either reduce or increase purchased power costs depending on the cost and availability of internal resources.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Purchased power expense from affiliates decreased by $19 million (2.5%) in 2024 due to a 6.3% decrease in volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a new PPA with Mississippi Power.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, increasing internal generation capacity and reducing reliance on external purchases.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Demand for energy is increasing due to data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing, driving the need for new generation and transmission assets.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The increased internal generation from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 reduced the need for affiliate power purchases, while the rising demand from new industries creates pressure to either invest in more generation or purchase power from non-affiliates depending on market prices."

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nEnergy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Purchased Power - Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from affiliates was $745 million in 2024, a decrease of $19 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 6.3% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Southern Company system units generally dispatched at a higher cost than available market resources, partially offset by capacity purchased through a new PPA with Mississippi Power and an increase of 3.8% in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $289 million, or 13.9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $167 million in transmission and distribution costs primarily associated with line maintenance and billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners, $126 million in generation expenses largely resulting from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively, $40 million in ex penses associated with unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, and $27 million in customer service and sales costs primarily associated with bad debt expense. Partially offsetting the increase was an increase of $91 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Transmission Asset Sales\" and \" - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $93 million, or 5.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase of $173 million associated with additional plant in service, partially offset by a decrease of $59 million in amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs as approved in the 2024 compliance filing under the terms of the 2022 ARP and an increase of $24 million in amortization of federal ITCs. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans\" for additional information. Also see Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information on amortization of federal ITCs.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $106 million, or 19.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase of $53 million in property taxes primarily resulting from an increase in the assessed value of property, a decrease of $30 million in property tax es capitalized primarily due to Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively, and an increase of $23 million in municipal franchise fees resulting from higher retail revenues. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\n## Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4\n\nGeorgia Power recorded credits to income related to the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $21 million and $68 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The credits to income reflected revisions to the total project capital cost forecast for the construction and completion of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost recovery. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction\n\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction decreased $13 million, or 7.9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed in service in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively, partially offset by an increase in capital ex penditures subject to AFUDC. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized\n\nInterest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized increased $99 million, or 15.8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily associated with increases of approximately $36 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $30 million related to higher interest rates, as well as a decrease of $31 million in AFUDC debt primarily related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "answer": "The total amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs for Alabama Power and Georgia Power in 2024 was $28 million ($13 million for Alabama Power and $15 million for Georgia Power). This reflects the difference in timing of cost recognition because Alabama Power amortizes nuclear refueling costs over 18 months, starting in January for fall outages and July for spring outages, while Georgia Power amortizes costs over 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1\u20134 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1\u20132, beginning in the month the refueling outage starts.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Alabama Power amortizes nuclear refueling costs over 18 months, starting in January for fall outages and July for spring outages; Georgia Power amortizes over 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1\u20134 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1\u20132, beginning in the month the outage starts.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs for 2024 was $13 million for Alabama Power and $15 million for Georgia Power.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in amortization timing (start date and period length) directly affects when each entity recognizes deferred cloud implementation costs in their financial statements, with Georgia Power having a potentially longer recognition period for certain units, which influences cost distribution across reporting periods."

      "question": "How does the $35 million decrease in wholesale revenue from ended power supply agreements, combined with the uncertainty in demand for energy driven by data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing, affect Southern Company's ability to recover costs of new generation assets under long-term PPAs?",
      "answer": "The $35 million decrease in wholesale revenue from ended power supply agreements reduces Southern Company's short-term cash flows, which could constrain its ability to fund new generation assets. Simultaneously, the rising demand for energy from data centers and advanced manufacturing, such as electric vehicles, increases the need for new power generation and transmission infrastructure. However, because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments to recover the full cost of these new assets, Southern Company faces regulatory lag and cost recovery risk. This situation is compounded when paired with reduced current revenues, as the company may struggle to fund capital expenditures while awaiting potential future recovery of costs through regulated rates or long-term PPAs, which themselves may not be extended or replaced at favorable terms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The $35 million decrease in wholesale revenue is tied to ended power supply agreements, which directly impacts Mississippi Power's and the broader Southern Company system's revenue base.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $44 million, or 16.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease was largely due to decreases of $35 million associated with power supply agreements mainly due to agreements that ended in 2023 and $10 million associated with MRA customers primarily due to lower recoverable fuel costs and customer usage, partially offset by an increase in demand as a result of weather impacts.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 13.9% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2024. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 under \"Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff\" for additional information.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $18 million, or 9.0%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $60 million in capacity revenues primarily associated with a new PPA with Georgia Power and $4 million related to the price of energy driven by natural gas prices. This increase was partially offset by decreases of $31 million in capacity revenues mainly associated with Mississippi Power's lower availability of generation reserves to the Southern Company power pool and $15 million primarily related to the volume of KWH sales. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power Integrated Resource Plans\" for additional information.\n\nWholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. The energy portion of these transactions does not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.\n\nIn 2024, other operating revenues increased $13 million, or 33.3%, as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in open access transmission tariff revenues.",

In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.\n\n## A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.\n\nThere are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nOther electric revenues increased $104 million, or 13.1%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $77 million in open access transmission tariff sales at the traditional electric operating companies, $29 million in regulated sales primarily associated with power delivery construction and maintenance at Georgia Power, and $23 million in regulated outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, partially offset by a net increase of $17 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs at Georgia Power and a decrease of $14 million related to liquidated damages receipts associated with generation facility production guarantees and an arbitration award in 2023 at Southern Power.\n\nOther revenues increased $90 million, or 22.7%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $71 million in unregulated sales at Georgia Power associated with power delivery construction and maintenance, energy conservation projects, and renewables and $13 million in unregulated outdoor lighting sales at the traditional electric operating companies.\n\n## Energy Sales\n\nChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the net amount recognized for energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes at Alabama Power: $7 million (2024 Current) and $23 million (2024 Non-current), totaling $30 million. However, the specific line item 'Net amounts recognized in the Balance Sheets' directly states $7 million for 2024 Current.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, identify the auditing firm associated with Alabama Power: Deloitte & Touche LLP is listed under the Alabama Power line item as the auditing firm providing consent.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize both pieces of information: Combine the financial metric from evidence_source_b with the auditing firm name from evidence_source_a to fully answer the multi-hop question."

      "question": "How does the regulatory infrastructure program rate mechanism, which is tied to the authorized ROE, impact Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas differently in terms of cost recovery timing and method?",
      "answer": "The regulatory infrastructure program rate mechanism allows Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas to recover infrastructure-related costs, but the timing and method differ. Nicor Gas does not use the regulatory infrastructure program rate mechanism, as indicated by the absence of a checkmark under this category in the table, and instead likely relies on other mechanisms such as the bad debt rider or energy efficiency plan. In contrast, Virginia Natural Gas does utilize this mechanism, which enables it to recover pipeline replacement program costs through its annual base rate review mechanism. This implies that Virginia Natural Gas can adjust its rates annually based on the authorized ROE (9.70% for Virginia Natural Gas) to recover infrastructure costs, while Nicor Gas must rely on less frequent base rate case decisions (last in 2023) or alternative riders for cost recovery.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Nicor Gas does not have a checkmark under 'Regulatory infrastructure program rate (c)', whereas Virginia Natural Gas does.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - The authorized ROE for Virginia Natural Gas is 9.70%, and for Nicor Gas it is 9.51%.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - The regulatory infrastructure program rate mechanism allows for cost recovery through the annual base rate review mechanism, specifically for pipeline replacement programs.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Because Virginia Natural Gas uses the regulatory infrastructure program rate mechanism, it can recover pipeline replacement costs annually based on its authorized ROE of 9.70%. Nicor Gas, lacking this mechanism, must rely on other riders or less frequent base rate cases for cost recovery, potentially leading to different financial impacts and recovery timelines."

      "answer": "The flowback of excess deferred income taxes reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 3.9 percentage points. However, this impact varies across its traditional electric operating subsidiaries: Alabama Power experiences a larger reduction of 5.3 percentage points, Georgia Power sees a smaller reduction of 2.2 percentage points, and Mississippi Power faces a 6.5 percentage point reduction. This variation indicates differing deferred tax positions among the subsidiaries, which may stem from differences in asset bases, regulatory environments, or investment patterns. Southern CompanyGas also experiences a 2.2 percentage point reduction, suggesting similar tax flowback mechanisms apply to its operations, though it does not benefit from the same scale of tax credits as Southern Power.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Southern Company's effective tax rate is reduced by 3.9 percentage points due to the flowback of excess deferred income taxes.",

        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - The flowback of excess deferred income taxes is a standard factor that lowers the effective tax rate at the regulated utilities, alongside other tax benefits like AFUDC equity and ITCs/PTCs.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The differential impact of the flowback mechanism across subsidiaries suggests varying tax positions and regulatory structures, and the absence of ITC/PTC benefits in the gas segment explains the higher effective tax rate despite similar flowback effects."

      "question": "How does the flowback of excess deferred income taxes impact Southern Company's effective tax rate compared to its traditional electric operating subsidiaries, and what role does this play in the overall tax rate reconciliation?",
      "answer": "The flowback of excess deferred income taxes reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points, while it reduces Alabama Power's rate by 1.9 percentage points, Georgia Power's by 9.6 percentage points, and Mississippi Power's by 7.8 percentage points. This mechanism contributes to Southern Company's effective tax rate being 18.8%, which is significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 21.0%, as stated in the reconciliation of tax rates. The flowback effect is more pronounced at Georgia Power and Mississippi Power, indicating a greater tax benefit at these subsidiaries compared to Alabama Power.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Southern Company's effective tax rate is 18.8%, with a 6.6 percentage point reduction due to flowback of excess deferred income taxes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power experience reductions of 1.9, 9.6, and 7.8 percentage points respectively from the same flowback mechanism.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Flowback of excess deferred income taxes is a key factor in Southern Company's tax rate being lower than the federal statutory rate of 21.0%.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The flowback mechanism significantly lowers the effective tax rate for both Southern Company and its regulated utilities, with Georgia Power seeing the largest benefit, which collectively contributes to the overall effective tax rate of 18.8% for the parent company."

      "answer": "The $197 million decrease in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes contributed to the increase in Southern Company's income taxes for 2024. This reduction in flowback, which previously served to lower the effective tax rate below the statutory rate, meant that one of the key factors that typically reduces the effective tax rate had less of an impact in 2024. Therefore, the absence of this benefit partially explains why the effective tax rate may have moved closer to the statutory rate, even though other factors like non-taxable AFUDC equity and ITCs continued to keep it lower than the statutory rate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that income taxes increased $279 million in 2024, with $197 million of that increase attributed to a decrease in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes.",

The increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million related to an impairment loss associated with Alabama Power discontinuing the development of a multi-use commercial facility, $21 million associated with an additional Rate NDR accrual, $16 million in certain employee compensation and benefits, $15 million in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, $10 million associated with reliability reserve accruals and reliability-related ex penses, $10 million in customer accounts primarily associated with bad debt ex pense, $9 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management, and $8 million related to the injuries and damages reserve. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $28 million in technology infrastructure and application production costs.\n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" and Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance,\" \" - Rate NDR,\" and \" - Reliability Reserve Accounting Order\" for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $58 million, or 4.1%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to additional plant in service related to transmission and distribution facilities as well as Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant\" for additional information.\n\n## Taxes Other Than Income Taxes\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $29 million, or 6.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases of $13 million in property taxes primarily resulting from an increase in the assessed value of property and $13 million in utility license tax es resulting from an increase in the tax  base.\n\n## Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction\n\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction decreased $25 million, or 30.5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant\" for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized\n\nInterest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized increased $23 million, or 5.4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily associated with increases of approximately $8 million related to higher interest rates and $8 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings, as well as a decrease of $8 million in AFUDC debt primarily due to Plant Barry Unit 8 being placed in service in November 2023. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY - \"Sources of Capital,\" Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP New Plant,\" and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $279 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $197 million in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes, as well as higher pre-tax  earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Accounting Order\" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nGeorgia Power's 2024 net income was $2.5 billion, representing a $0.5 billion, or 22.3%, increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to higher retail revenues associated with the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2022 ARP, and weather impacts, partially offset by a $112 million increase in charges to a valuation allowance on certain state tax  credit carryforwards.",

      "answer": "Southern Company experienced a total financial loss of $40 million from energy-related cash flow hedges tied to natural gas costs in 2024. In contrast, the company recorded a gain of $94 million from non-designated energy-related derivatives linked to natural gas costs in the same year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Southern Company reports a $40 million loss under 'Cost of natural gas' for energy-related cash flow hedges in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Southern Company reports a $94 million gain under 'Cost of natural gas' for non-designated hedging relationships in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The two distinct derivative categories (cash flow hedges vs. non-designated) related to natural gas costs show opposing financial impacts: a loss in one category and a gain in the other."

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nOn July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's 2024 Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

      "answer": "The timing of customer receivable collections negatively impacted the combined net cash provided from operating activities across Southern Company and Southern Power by $2.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Southern Company's net cash provided from operating activities increased by $2.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, and the timing of customer receivable collections was listed as a partial offset to this increase.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Southern Power's net cash provided from operating activities decreased by $388 million in 2024 compared to 2023, and the timing of customer receivable collections was listed as a contributing factor to the decrease.",
        "Step 3: To determine the total negative impact of customer receivable collections on both companies, we subtract Southern Power's decrease from Southern Company's increase: $2.2 billion - $388 million = $1.812 billion. However, since the timing of collections was only a partial offset for Southern Company and a contributing factor for Southern Power, the full negative impact must be greater than the net result. Therefore, the combined negative impact is approximately $2.3 billion."

      "answer": "The $40 million increase in unregulated power delivery construction expenses at Georgia Power was a key component of the $66 million overall increase in cost of other sales in 2024, which directly contributed to the $425 million year-over-year increase in Southern Company's consolidated net income being lower than it otherwise could have been. While this cost increase put upward pressure on expenses in 2024, the $72 million base rate increase approved for Atlanta Gas Light in 2024 (effective January 1, 2025) would not have impacted 2024 earnings but is expected to improve future financial performance starting in 2025. Thus, while the cost of other sales increase negatively affected 2024 earnings, the Atlanta Gas Light rate increase represents a forward-looking revenue enhancement mechanism that could positively influence future net income.",

The decrease was primarily the result of a $244 million decrease related to the average cost of fuel generated and purchased, partially offset by a $30 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. Also contributing to the decrease was a $55 million credit to nuclear fuel expense at Georgia Power resulting from litigation related to nuclear fuel disposal costs.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nOn July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's 2024 Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nOn July 2, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation related to Atlanta Gas Light's 2024 Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan, which allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

If accepted by the states, these positions would decrease Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' annual effective tax rates. The ultimate outcome of these unrecognized tax benefits is dependent on acceptance by each state and is not expected to be resolved within the next 12 months.\n\nThe unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2023 is primarily related to the amendment of certain 2019 through 2021 state tax filing positions related to tax  credit utilization, a portion of which decreased in the fourth quarter 2023 due to a statute of limitations ex piration. If effective settlement of the positions is favorable, these positions would decrease Southern Company's and Georgia Power's annual effective tax rates. The ultimate outcome of this unrecognized tax benefit, which is expected to be resolved within the next 12 months, is dependent on acceptance by the state or expiration of related statute of limitations.\n\nThe unrecognized tax positions reductions due to statute of limitations expiration for 2023 primarily relate to a 2019 state tax  filing position to ex clude certain gains from 2019 dispositions from taxation in a certain unitary state. This tax  position and related interest was recognized in the fourth quarter 2023 and decreased Southern Company's annual effective tax rate.\n\nThe unrecognized tax positions increase from prior periods for 2024 is primarily related to a certain state tax  filing position at Southern Company G as. If effective settlement of this position is favorable, this position would decrease Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' annual effective tax rates. The ultimate outcome is dependent on acceptance by the state.\n\nThe unrecognized tax positions decrease from prior periods for 2024 is primarily related to the 2019 and 2020 amended state filing positions related to tax  credit utilization at G eorgia Power.\n\nAll of the Registrants classify interest on tax  uncertainties as interest ex pense.

      "answer": "Alabama Power had $7 million in net energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes in 2024, while Southern Company as a whole recognized $45 million. This indicates that Alabama Power accounted for approximately 15.6% of Southern Company's net hedging liabilities in this category, suggesting a significant but not dominant role in the company's overall regulatory hedging strategy.",

      "question": "How might the potential $89 million annual assessment from NEIL insurance policies impact Georgia Power's allocation strategy in its equity and fixed income investments as disclosed in the fair value table?",
      "answer": "The potential $89 million annual assessment from NEIL insurance policies introduces a liability risk that could affect Georgia Power's financial flexibility. Given that Georgia Power's fair value table shows $868 million allocated to domestic equity and $460 million to U.S. Treasury, government, and agency bonds, a significant assessment could pressure liquidity. This might necessitate rebalancing from riskier equity investments (like the $651 million in domestic equity under Level 1) to more liquid or stable fixed income assets to ensure sufficient reserves for potential assessments, especially since such assessments could have a material effect on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's financial condition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL policies is $89 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power's fair value table shows $868 million in domestic equity and $460 million in U.S. Treasury, government, and agency bonds.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A potential $89 million liability could force Georgia Power to adjust its investment strategy by reducing exposure to equity markets and increasing holdings in more liquid or stable fixed income instruments to maintain financial stability."

      "question": "How do the potential insurance assessments and revenue contributions from Georgia Power influence Southern Company's financial risk exposure and operational stability?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power contributes $10,118 million in operating revenues to Southern Company, forming a significant portion of its financial base. However, Georgia Power is also subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under the NEIL policies, which could increase Southern Company's financial risk exposure if triggered. This assessment could impact Southern Company's operational stability by diverting funds that might otherwise be used for growth or debt reduction. Additionally, in the event of a nuclear incident, Georgia Power's uninsured losses could further strain Southern Company's finances, as insurance proceeds may not cover all incurred expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power contributes $10,118 million in operating revenues to Southern Company.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Georgia Power's revenue contribution is significant, but its potential insurance assessments could pose financial risk to Southern Company, affecting its stability and resource allocation."

      "question": "How do Georgia Power's participation in the securities lending program and its exposure to NEIL insurance assessments collectively affect Southern Company's financial risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power's participation in the securities lending program exposes Southern Company to potential liquidity and collateral risk, as $35 million of the fair market value of its securities were on loan at the end of 2022, and the company could face challenges if the collateral received ($36 million) were insufficient or could not be liquidated quickly. Additionally, Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL insurance policies, which could increase Southern Company's liability in the event of nuclear-related losses. Together, these commitments increase Southern Company's overall financial risk exposure by tying up capital in potentially illiquid assets and exposing it to unexpected assessments that could impact cash flow and financial stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power had $35 million in fair market value of securities on loan under the securities lending program as of December 31, 2022, with $36 million in collateral received.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual NEIL insurance assessment of $89 million as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - These two factors together increase Southern Company's financial risk: the securities lending program ties up assets and depends on the quality and liquidity of collateral, while the NEIL assessment could impose a significant cash liability on Georgia Power, which would affect the consolidated financial position of Southern Company."

      "question": "How do the asset retirement obligations related to nuclear decommissioning at Georgia Power influence the potential financial impact of uninsured losses from nuclear incidents, considering both the retrospective assessment limits and the ongoing accruals for decommissioning?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power has asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to the decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, including Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 through 3. These AROs are accrued and capitalized as part of the related long-lived assets, with ongoing depreciation and liability adjustments. However, in the event of an uninsured nuclear incident, Georgia Power could face retrospective assessments up to $89 million under NEIL policies. These assessments, while capped annually, could compound existing ARO-related liabilities. Since insurance proceeds after a nuclear incident are prioritized first for reactor safety, then decontamination, and only then for remaining costs or company reimbursement, Georgia Power may bear significant uninsured losses. These losses, combined with ongoing ARO accruals for decommissioning, could materially affect Georgia Power\u2019s and Southern Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power has AROs for nuclear decommissioning at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1\u20133, with accruals and depreciation reflected in financial statements.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to retrospective assessments under NEIL policies, with a maximum annual assessment of $89 million in the event of losses exceeding available insurance funds.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of existing ARO liabilities for nuclear decommissioning and potential uninsured losses from nuclear incidents (with possible retrospective assessments) creates a multi-hop causal chain that could significantly impact Georgia Power\u2019s financial position."

      "answer": "The actuarial gain of $1,161 million for Georgia Power in 2022, as reported in the pension obligations, improves Georgia Power's financial position by reducing its pension liability. This financial strengthening could help Georgia Power better absorb the maximum annual assessment of $89 million under the NEIL insurance policy, reducing the potential negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations in the event of a nuclear incident requiring retrospective assessments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract Georgia Power's 2022 actuarial gain of $1,161 million from the pension obligations table in evidence_source_a.",
        "Step 2: Extract Georgia Power's maximum annual NEIL insurance assessment of $89 million from evidence_source_b.",
        "Step 3: Understand that the NEIL policy allows for retrospective assessments which could impact Georgia Power's financials.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that the large actuarial gain improves Georgia Power's financial position, making it better able to handle the potential NEIL assessment without as significant an impact on its operations."

      "answer": "Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment under the NEIL policies is $89 million, while Alabama Power's is $54 million, resulting in a $35 million difference. In 2023, Georgia Power's amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs was $19 million, whereas Alabama Power's was $11 million, showing a $8 million difference.

This is calculated by adding the maximum annual NEIL assessment of $89 million (from evidence_source_b) to the $82 million charged against storm damage reserves in 2022 (from evidence_source_a), as these represent the upper bounds of potential annual financial obligations Georgia Power could face under these two risk categories.",

      "question": "How did Georgia Power's 2022 Annual Rate Plan (ARP) base tariff increases and its potential maximum NEIL policy assessment in 2023 collectively impact Southern Company\u2019s financial exposure and revenue structure?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power's 2022 ARP led to base tariff increases in 2023, which contributed to a $1.9 billion decrease in Southern Company's retail electric revenues due to prior-year pricing adjustments. Separately, Georgia Power faced a potential maximum NEIL policy assessment of $89 million in 2023, which would increase Southern Company's financial exposure if losses exceeded available funds under the NEIL policies. Together, these factors show how Georgia Power's rate-setting mechanisms and insurance risk transfer strategies directly influence Southern Company's consolidated financial position and revenue stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Retail electric revenues decreased $1.9 billion, or 10.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022, with the increase in rates attributed to Georgia Power's 2022 Annual Rate Plan (ARP).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL policies as of December 31, 2023, was $89 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Georgia Power\u2019s rate adjustments under the 2022 ARP directly affected Southern Company\u2019s consolidated revenue in 2023, while its NEIL insurance exposure added a potential $89 million liability, increasing Southern Company\u2019s overall financial risk."

In the event of a nuclear incident, insurance proceeds must first be used to stabilize the reactor, then for decontamination, and only residual amounts may be applied to financial obligations.

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power is a key segment of Southern Company and has agreements related to the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, including Plant Vogtle. This indicates Georgia Power's involvement in nuclear operations, which exposes it to nuclear-specific risks.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power has a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL insurance policies, which are triggered if losses exceed available funds. This represents a direct financial liability.",

      "question": "How do the potential financial obligations from nuclear insurance assessments and debt instrument structures impact Georgia Power's financial flexibility, particularly in relation to its maximum annual NEIL policy assessment and its connection to Southern Company's subordinated note indentures?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power faces a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under the NEIL nuclear insurance policies, which could strain its liquidity if triggered. This obligation is compounded by its relationship with Southern Company, which has subordinated note indentures that include provisions through May 1, 2022. These indentures could constrain Georgia Power\u2019s financial flexibility, as Southern Company\u2019s debt obligations may limit its ability to provide financial support or absorb losses. If Georgia Power is assessed the full $89 million and cannot absorb the cost, and Southern Company is constrained by its subordinated debt structure, Georgia Power may need to seek regulatory relief or pass costs to customers, which could affect its credit profile and operational planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Southern Company has subordinated note indentures with provisions extending through May 1, 2022, which could limit its ability to provide financial support to Georgia Power.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power has a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under the NEIL nuclear insurance policies, which could directly impact its financial condition if losses exceed available funds.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of Georgia Power's potential insurance liability and Southern Company's debt constraints creates a multi-hop causal relationship where both entities' financial flexibility is interlinked and potentially constrained."

      "answer": "Georgia Power faces a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under the NEIL policies, while Alabama Power faces a lower maximum annual assessment of $54 million. This indicates that Georgia Power has greater financial risk exposure compared to Alabama Power in the event of losses exceeding the accumulated funds available to NEIL. Both companies are subject to retrospective assessments that may be taxed at the state level, increasing their overall liability. This difference in assessment amounts highlights a disparity in risk allocation between the two subsidiaries under the shared insurance framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power and Alabama Power are both subsidiaries of Southern Company and are subject to NEIL insurance policies.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The maximum annual assessments under NEIL policies are $54 million for Alabama Power and $89 million for Georgia Power.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The higher assessment for Georgia Power indicates a greater financial risk exposure compared to Alabama Power under the same insurance policies, demonstrating a causal link between policy structure and financial obligations."

      "answer": "The potential maximum annual NEIL policy assessment for Georgia Power is $89 million, and the actuarial liability for Georgia Power at the end of 2023 is $489 million. These figures represent significant financial obligations that Southern Company must account for in its consolidated financial statements. The NEIL assessment could increase Georgia Power's liabilities further, directly impacting Southern Company\u2019s consolidated financial position by increasing its overall obligation burden.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power's actuarial liability at the end of 2023 is $489 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power's maximum annual NEIL policy assessment is $89 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both the NEIL assessment and the existing actuarial liability represent financial obligations for Georgia Power, which is a subsidiary of Southern Company. Therefore, these liabilities directly affect Southern Company\u2019s consolidated financial obligations."

      "question": "How does the change in Georgia Power's electric generating units from 2022 to 2023, combined with its maximum annual NEIL policy assessment, affect Southern Company's potential financial exposure in the event of a nuclear-related incident?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power's electric generating units decreased from $1,163 million in 2022 to $1,028 million in 2023, a reduction of $135 million. This indicates a decline in asset base related to power generation. However, Georgia Power remains subject to a maximum annual NEIL policy assessment of $89 million in the event of losses exceeding available funds. In the case of a nuclear incident, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to cover property damage and other expenses. If insurance is inadequate, Southern Company would bear the uninsured losses, which could be significantly impacted by both the reduced asset base and the potential $89 million assessment. This creates a dual financial exposure: lower asset value to absorb losses and a potentially large retrospective assessment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power's electric generating units decreased from $1,163 million (2022) to $1,028 million (2023), a $135 million reduction.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power has a maximum annual NEIL policy assessment of $89 million for potential losses at its nuclear facilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The reduction in asset value decreases the company's financial cushion while the NEIL assessment creates additional liability pressure in the event of a nuclear incident.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize further - Southern Company would bear any uninsured losses, making the combination of reduced asset base and potential assessment critical to understanding its overall financial risk exposure."

      "question": "How do the potential insurance-related liabilities from nuclear power plant policies impact Georgia Power's financial stability, and what is the maximum annual assessment Georgia Power could face under NEIL policies?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power could face a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies, which could significantly affect its financial stability if triggered. These assessments are retrospective and could be subject to state premium taxes, further increasing the financial burden. Additionally, in the event of a nuclear incident, insurance proceeds must first be used to stabilize the reactor, then for decontamination, with any remaining funds going to the company or its debt trustees. If insurance proceeds are insufficient, Georgia Power would bear the remaining costs, which could materially affect its financial condition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Georgia Power has only common stock outstanding and is a subsidiary of Southern Company, which relies on retained earnings for dividend payments.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies due to nuclear insurance coverage.",
        "Step 3: The proceeds from nuclear insurance policies must be used first for reactor stabilization, then decontamination, with any remainder going to the company or its debt trustees, potentially limiting Georgia Power\u2019s liquidity in case of a major incident.",
        "Step 4: Combining these facts shows that both potential insurance assessments and insufficient insurance coverage in the event of a nuclear incident could materially impact Georgia Power\u2019s financial stability."

      "answer": "The classification of the $200 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due in 2073 as 'securities due within one year' increases Southern Company's short-term liabilities for 2023 because the notes are repayable at the option of the holders in 2024. This classification leads to a significant increase in the 'Securities due within one year' line item from $1 million in 2022 to $201 million in 2023, thereby increasing total current liabilities to $679 million for 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Securities due within one year' increased from $1 million in 2022 to $201 million in 2023, contributing to total current liabilities of $679 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - $200 million of Series 2023A Floating Rate Senior Notes due May 15, 2073 are classified as due within one year because they are repayable at the option of the holders in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $200 million in long-dated notes are reclassified as short-term liabilities due to holder optionality in 2024, directly causing the $200 million increase in 'Securities due within one year' from 2022 to 2023, which significantly increases Southern Company\u2019s total current liabilities for 2023."

      "answer": "Georgia Power faces a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million in 2024 under NEIL policies, and its capital expenditures from 2024 to 2030 total $147 million ($73M + $41M + $14M + $15M + $15M + $9M). This adds to Southern Company's overall financial exposure, particularly since uninsured losses or retrospective assessments could result in material impacts on Southern Company's financial condition if not recovered from customers. Thus, Georgia Power's risk profile directly contributes to Southern Company's financial obligations and operational risk.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power's capital expenditures for 2024 through thereafter total $147 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Georgia Power's financial obligations (capital expenditures and potential insurance assessments) contribute to Southern Company's overall financial exposure, particularly in the event of uninsured losses or retrospective assessments that are not customer-recovered."

      "question": "What is the combined maximum annual assessment that Alabama Power and Georgia Power could face under the NEIL policies, and how could these assessments potentially impact Southern Company's financial condition in the event of a nuclear-related loss at their commercial power plants?",
      "answer": "The combined maximum annual assessment that Alabama Power and Georgia Power could face under the NEIL policies is $143 million ($54 million for Alabama Power and $89 million for Georgia Power). In the event of a nuclear-related loss, the proceeds from the insurance policies would first be used to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition, then toward decontamination and debris removal. If these insurance proceeds are insufficient to cover the costs, uninsured losses would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, which could have a material effect on Southern Company's financial condition and results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under NEIL policies are $54 million and $89 million, respectively.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses, and uninsured losses would be borne by Alabama Power or Georgia Power, potentially affecting Southern Company's financial condition.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combined assessment exposure of $143 million represents a financial liability that could be triggered in the event of a major incident. If such an incident occurs and insurance proceeds are insufficient, Southern Company could face significant additional costs that materially affect its financial statements."

      "answer": "The increase in Georgia Power's wholesale energy sales volume by $13 million due to higher market demand exposes Southern Company to greater revenue volatility tied to fluctuating market prices and generation availability. Simultaneously, Georgia Power faces a potential maximum annual NEIL insurance assessment of $89 million in the event of a major loss, such as a nuclear incident or cyber event. This dual exposure means that while increased energy sales could boost short-term revenues, a catastrophic event could trigger significant retrospective insurance costs, directly impacting Southern Company's earnings and financial stability. Thus, the combination of operational growth and insurance liability risk amplifies Southern Company's overall financial exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power experienced a $13 million increase in wholesale energy sales volume associated with higher market demand in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual NEIL insurance assessment of $89 million in the event of losses exceeding available funds under its NEIL policy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increased sales volume increases Georgia Power's (and thus Southern Company's) operational exposure to market fluctuations, while the NEIL assessment risk introduces a significant contingent liability. Together, these factors heighten Southern Company's financial risk profile."

      "answer": "Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies could be triggered if losses exceed available funds, such as in the event of a nuclear incident at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Additionally, Georgia Power could face further financial exposure if it becomes obligated to fund MEAG Power\u2019s share of costs related to these units. Given that insurance proceeds after a nuclear incident are prioritized for reactor safety and decontamination, any uninsured losses would directly affect Georgia Power and, by extension, Southern Company's financial condition. This dual exposure creates a significant risk to Southern Company\u2019s overall stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power's involvement with MEAG Power and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and JEA creates potential funding obligations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power has a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL insurance policies related to nuclear incidents.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If an uninsured nuclear incident occurs at Plant Vogtle, Georgia Power may face both NEIL assessments and MEAG-related funding obligations, directly threatening Southern Company\u2019s financial health."

      "answer": "Georgia Power's total potential financial exposure in 2023 is $89 million from nuclear insurance policy assessments plus $113 million in net derivative liabilities, totaling $202 million. Alabama Power's combined obligations are $54 million from nuclear insurance assessments plus $100 million in net derivative liabilities, totaling $154 million. Therefore, Georgia Power\u2019s exposure is $48 million greater than Alabama Power\u2019s.",

      "answer": "Georgia Power's total potential financial exposure in the event of a nuclear accident includes a maximum annual retrospective assessment of $89 million under the NEIL policy. Additionally, if insurance proceeds are inadequate to cover property damage and other expenses, uninsured losses would be borne by Georgia Power, potentially impacting its financial condition. Given that Georgia Power's portfolio as of December 31, 2023, includes $409 million in total assets with a 57% allocation to equity (primarily domestic and international equities totaling $109 million) and 35% to fixed income (totaling $30 million), a significant uninsured loss could disproportionately affect its equity and fixed income positions, straining its financial stability.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The $89 million NEIL assessment, combined with potential uninsured losses, could significantly impact Georgia Power's financial stability, especially given its asset allocation, which includes a large portion in equity and fixed income that may be used to cover such liabilities."

      "question": "How do the potential insurance assessments and debt obligations tied to Georgia Power impact Southern Company's overall financial exposure as revealed across the 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's overall financial exposure is significantly heightened due to its stake in Georgia Power, which faces a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies. Additionally, Georgia Power has multiple debt obligations, including senior and subordinated notes, loan guarantees, and promissory notes, which collectively increase the financial risk to Southern Company. If Georgia Power incurs uninsured losses or is required to pay these assessments, Southern Company would bear the financial burden, potentially affecting its financial condition and results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power has multiple debt obligations, including senior notes, subordinated notes, loan guarantees, and promissory notes, indicating significant financial commitments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies, which could result in substantial cash outflows.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Southern Company, as the parent entity, is financially exposed to Georgia Power's obligations and insurance assessments. If Georgia Power incurs uninsured losses or must pay these assessments, Southern Company would bear the costs, increasing its overall financial risk."

Southern Company reported a total fair value loss of $264 million from its hedging activities as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL nuclear insurance policies is $89 million, which could be triggered if losses exceed accumulated funds. Additionally, Georgia Power has long-term energy procurement commitments extending to 2026, as shown by its 128 mmBtu net purchased volume and longest hedge date in 2026. These commitments expose Georgia Power to both potential insurance liabilities and ongoing energy cost risks. Since Georgia Power is a subsidiary of Southern Company, these exposures directly influence Southern Company's consolidated financial risk, particularly in terms of unexpected liabilities and long-term cost structures. This dual exposure could materially affect Southern Company's financial condition and results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power has a longest hedge date of 2026 and a net purchased volume of 128 mmBtu, indicating long-term energy procurement commitments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power has a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies, representing potential liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - These two financial exposures (insurance assessments and long-term energy contracts) combine to create a multi-dimensional risk profile for Georgia Power, which flows up to Southern Company.",
        "Step 4: Conclude - The question requires understanding both risk categories and their joint impact on Southern Company's financial stability, making it multi-hop and causal."

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document lists Georgia Power as one of Southern Company's key segments, establishing its financial linkage to the parent company.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power are Southern Company segments, and the combined NEIL assessment exposure totals $143 million. Since the 10-K explicitly states that uninsured losses could have a material effect on Southern Company\u2019s financial condition, these assessments represent a significant contingent liability."

      "question": "How much would Georgia Power be required to pay in maximum annual assessments under the NEIL policies, and how does this compare to the actuarial gain or loss impact on its pension obligations in 2023?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power would be required to pay $89 million in maximum annual assessments under the NEIL policies. In 2023, Georgia Power experienced an actuarial gain of $125 million in its pension obligations. This means that while Georgia Power saw a reduction in pension liabilities due to the actuarial gain, it also faced a potential cash outflow of $89 million due to the NEIL policy assessments. These two figures represent contrasting financial pressures on Georgia Power\u2014one reducing future pension costs and the other increasing potential insurance-related liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Georgia Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL policies is $89 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Georgia Power recorded an actuarial gain of $125 million in its pension obligations in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $89 million NEIL assessment represents a potential liability, while the $125 million actuarial gain reduces pension obligations, creating offsetting financial impacts."
