In the first data set, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $7.64 in 2023, representing a 10% decline from $8.50 in 2022. In the second data set, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $8.66 in 2023, showing a 2% increase from $8.48 in 2022.

      "answer": "Netflix's Non-Current Content Liabilities decreased by $0.5 billion, from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $2.6 billion in 2023. Over the same period, total content obligations remained nearly flat, decreasing slightly from $21.8 billion to $21.7 billion.

      "answer": "The total change in the number of shares used in the per share computation for Class A shares from 2019 to 2021 under the basic net income per share calculation is 912 shares (300,310 - 299,402). In 2019, the diluted net income per share for Class A was $49.16 based on 346,342 shares, while in 2021, it was $112.20 based on 345,755 shares, indicating a significant increase in per-share earnings despite a nearly unchanged diluted share count.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The number of shares used in the basic per share computation for Class A in 2019 was 299,402.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the change - 300,310 (2021) - 299,402 (2019) = 908 additional shares.",
        "Step 4: Extract diluted share counts and per-share figures - In 2019, diluted net income per share for Class A was $49.16 based on 346,342 shares; in 2021, it was $112.20 based on 345,755 shares.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - While the basic share count increased slightly, the diluted share count remained relatively stable, yet the diluted net income per share nearly doubled, indicating a significant increase in earnings."

This decrease was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by the film studios, partially offset by the timing of content availability from the television studios, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages in the prior year.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the Content Licensing Revenue figures for 2023 ($8,231 million) and 2024 ($8,063 million) to calculate the year-over-year decrease of $168 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, identify the stated reason for the decrease in Content Licensing Revenue\u2014namely, the timing of content availability from film studios, partially offset by television studio content timing and the impact of prior-year labor stoppages.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided over the contract period. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging  from 2  years  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  to  up  to 5  years  for  larger  enterprises.  Customers  with  contracts  may  only  discontinue  service  in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual Business Services Connectivity segment revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers under contract typically pay on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\n## Media Segment\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days.  In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of television programming in the United States and internationally to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment, and to virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. This revenue includes amounts under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, and we also receive associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly subscription fees for our Peacock service either directly from customers or from companies who sell Peacock to customers on our behalf. We have determined that we are principal in these arrangements and in the event we do not have transparency into the pricing charged by a company selling Peacock on our behalf, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the fees receivable from that company pursuant to our arrangement.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fix ed fee. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the decrease in Studios segment revenue, driven by lower content licensing revenue, relate to the specific timing and recognition of future content licensing revenue described in the Media segment's contractual arrangements?",
      "answer": "The Studios segment experienced a revenue decrease, partly due to lower content licensing revenue, which was impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages. According to the contractual revenue recognition policy described in the Media segment, content licensing revenue is recognized when the content becomes available for use by the licensee, and future revenue from fixed-price agreements typically covers between half a year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue. Therefore, the timing of content delivery and licensing renewals directly affects the Studios segment's reported revenue decline, as much of the future revenue is tied to when content becomes available under existing agreements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the Studios segment revenue decreased, partly due to a drop in content licensing revenue, influenced by the 2023 labor stoppages.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, content licensing revenue is recognized only when the content becomes available for use by the licensee, and future revenue from fixed pricing typically equals half a year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The Studios revenue decline is directly tied to the timing and availability of content under licensing agreements, which determines when revenue can be recognized under the contractual terms described in the Media segment."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided over the contract period. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging  from 2  years  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  to  up  to 5  years  for  larger  enterprises.  Customers  with  contracts  may  only  discontinue  service  in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual Business Services Connectivity segment revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers under contract typically pay on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\n## Media Segment\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days.  In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of television programming in the United States and internationally to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment, and to virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. This revenue includes amounts under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, and we also receive associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly subscription fees for our Peacock service either directly from customers or from companies who sell Peacock to customers on our behalf. We have determined that we are principal in these arrangements and in the event we do not have transparency into the pricing charged by a company selling Peacock on our behalf, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the fees receivable from that company pursuant to our arrangement.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fix ed fee. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Meta's privacy-related regulatory challenges, including compliance with the FTC consent order and investigations by privacy authorities, create operational constraints that affect user experience and trust, potentially reducing user growth and engagement. Additionally, Meta's restrictions on developer access to user data, aimed at improving privacy and security, have reduced distribution and monetization opportunities for developers, leading to decreased user engagement with integrated applications. Together, these factors contribute to a decline in user retention and engagement on Facebook and Instagram, especially in markets with high penetration rates.",

      "answer": "Meta faces legal and regulatory risks from both content liability and international operations that could significantly affect user growth and financial performance. From evidence_source_a, the company is exposed to litigation and regulatory actions related to content published on its platforms, including defamation, misinformation, and discrimination claims, which could lead to significant costs and damages. Additionally, new legislation like the European Digital Services Act and the European Copyright Directive requires Meta to make substantial compliance investments and may force changes to its products, reducing user engagement and growth. From evidence_source_b, Meta's global expansion is hindered by geopolitical events, trade restrictions, and compliance costs, which may force the company to modify or cease operations in certain regions, directly impacting user growth. These combined pressures increase operational costs, reduce international user expansion, and threaten financial performance by limiting revenue opportunities and increasing legal and compliance expenditures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Legal risks include litigation over content, such as defamation, misinformation, and discrimination claims, and regulatory requirements like the European Digital Services Act and European Copyright Directive, which require compliance investments and may alter product offerings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - International expansion risks include geopolitical events, trade restrictions, and compliance costs, which may force Meta to modify or cease operations in certain regions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both legal content liability and international regulatory challenges limit Meta\u2019s ability to grow its user base and increase costs, thereby adversely affecting financial performance and user engagement."

      "answer": "Meta generates substantially all of its revenue from advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. However, regulatory changes in Europe have led to the offering of a 'subscription-for-no-ads' alternative in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland, which reduces the company's ability to effectively target ads. This change negatively affects Meta's advertising business because it limits the precision and effectiveness of ad delivery, which is a key factor in attracting marketers. If marketers perceive a reduced return on investment due to less effective targeting, they may reduce their advertising budgets or choose alternative platforms, directly harming Meta's revenue and financial results.",

This regulatory burden could reduce user growth and engagement by limiting the company's ability to efficiently operate across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, Meta's efforts to enforce privacy and security policies, such as restricting developer access to user data and reducing communications from developers to users, have already reduced distribution from and engagement with applications integrated with Meta's products. These two factors\u2014regulatory penalties and strained developer relationships\u2014jointly create a dual challenge: increased operational costs and reduced third-party innovation and user interaction, both of which could significantly hinder Meta's ability to grow its user base and maintain engagement.",

      "question": "Given META's expectation that future user growth will be concentrated in lower ARPU regions like Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, and considering the negative brand impacts described from regulatory scrutiny and user well-being concerns, how might these brand challenges specifically affect the rate of user growth in those regions and consequently influence the overall growth of worldwide ARPU in 2024?",
      "answer": "META expects future user growth to be primarily concentrated in regions with lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, where 2023 ARPU increased by 20% and 21% respectively, yet still remain lower than other regions. However, brand reputation risks from regulatory scrutiny, privacy concerns, and negative sentiment around content enforcement and user well-being may slow user acquisition or engagement in these key growth regions. This could reduce the pace of user growth or limit monetization potential in those areas, which in turn could dampen the overall increase in worldwide ARPU, even if per-region ARPU continues to rise. The combination of these factors suggests that reputational damage could constrain the financial upside expected from expanding into lower ARPU markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, META notes that user growth is concentrated in lower ARPU regions (Asia-Pacific and Rest of World), which saw 20% and 21% ARPU growth respectively in 2023.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, META acknowledges that media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny\u2014such as from the 2021 former employee leaks and 2018 data misuse incident\u2014have adversely affected its brand and could continue to do so.",
        "Step 3: A weakened brand may reduce user trust or engagement, particularly in emerging markets where brand perception is critical, thereby slowing user growth or monetization potential in those regions.",
        "Step 4: Since worldwide ARPU is sensitive to the mix of users across geographies, slower growth or reduced monetization in lower ARPU regions could limit the overall ARPU growth trajectory in 2024."

      "answer": "The year-over-year percentage change in non-GAAP constant currency revenues for Google in 2023 was 12%. Google excludes hedging effects when calculating this metric to provide a clearer view of its core operating performance by removing the impact of foreign currency volatility, which is not indicative of the company's underlying business results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Google defines non-GAAP constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements and hedging activities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Google calculates the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis by translating current period revenues using prior year exchange rates and excluding hedging effects from both periods.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The exclusion of hedging effects ensures that the percentage change reflects only the true operational performance, not financial activities like currency hedging, allowing for more accurate period-to-period comparisons."

      "answer": "The geopolitical risks affecting consumer hardware supply chains could result in shipping delays, supply shortages, and increased costs, which may hinder the availability and affordability of META's consumer hardware products. These disruptions could negatively impact product development, sales, and user satisfaction. Simultaneously, mobile ecosystem limitations, such as Apple's and Google's changes to privacy features like third-party cookie restrictions, reduce META's ability to deliver relevant ads and impact monetization. These limitations may discourage advertisers and reduce the effectiveness of META's platform for marketing, potentially harming user growth and engagement. Together, these factors could create a dual challenge: reduced access to high-quality, affordable hardware and a less effective advertising ecosystem, both of which could jointly constrain META's ability to attract and retain users, thereby adversely affecting its user growth prospects.",

We also  must  manage  our  obligations  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  related  to  import  and  ex port  controls,  trade  restrictions,  and  sanctions,  including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. G overnment agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\n\n## We face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\n\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The  manufacturing,  distribution,  and  sale  of  our  consumer  hardware  products  also  may  be  negatively  impacted  by  macroeconomic  conditions,  geopolitical challenges,  trade  disputes,  or  other  actions  by  governments  or  non-state  actors  (including  international  conflicts,  tariffs,  sanctions,  ex port  controls,  and  other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.\n\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.",

For  ex ample, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target  and  measure  ads  effectively,  while  expanding  their  own  advertising business. In addition, G oogle previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, G oogle's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we  do  not  control,  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  and  browser  developers.  We  may  not  be  successful  in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create  successful  new  products,  both  independently  and  in  conjunction  with  developers  or  other  third  parties.  We  may  introduce  significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For ex ample, we continue to launch new AI features on our products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\n\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and Instagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney G eneral is seeking to enjoin our offering of default endto-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\n\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance could be harmed.",

Simultaneously, Apple's iOS updates limit Meta's ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads, directly impacting monetization. These combined regulatory and platform-specific constraints reduce Meta's ability to deliver relevant ads and maintain user engagement, especially on mobile devices, thereby negatively affecting both user growth and financial performance.",

These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is ex pected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.\n\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data protection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject rights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties  (including  substantial  monetary  remedies),  interrupt  or  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  materially  adverse  to  our  business (including  changes  to  our  products  or  user  data  practices),  result  in  negative  publicity  and  reputational  harm,  divert  resources  and  the  time  and  attention  of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.",

For  ex ample, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target  and  measure  ads  effectively,  while  expanding  their  own  advertising business. In addition, G oogle previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, G oogle's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we  do  not  control,  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  and  browser  developers.  We  may  not  be  successful  in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create  successful  new  products,  both  independently  and  in  conjunction  with  developers  or  other  third  parties.  We  may  introduce  significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For ex ample, we continue to launch new AI features on our products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\n\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and Instagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney G eneral is seeking to enjoin our offering of default endto-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\n\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\n## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nOur  Reality  Labs  efforts  include  our  metaverse  and  wearables  initiatives.  We  believe  the  metaverse,  an  embodied  internet  where  people  have  immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain.  We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-party mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, ex port controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality Labs strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and ex panding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprotected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding  online  platform  liability  for  copyright  infringement  and  regulating  certain  uses  of  news  content  online,  which  the  EU  member  states  have  since implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary liability framework limiting liability for third-party content, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address  Section 230 in its decision.  There also have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the  United  States could decrease or change.  We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\n\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in G ermany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For ex ample, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services  to  obtain  authorizations  for  copyrighted  content  or  to  implement  measures  to  prevent  the  availability  of  that  content,  which  may  require  us  to  make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements, and we are subject to increased compliance costs, and potential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended the availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.\n\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\n\nSeveral  of  our  products  offer  Payments  functionality,  including  enabling  our  users  to  purchase  tangible,  virtual,  and  digital  goods  from  merchants  and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new consumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments activity as well as sharing, collection, and use of payments-related data. For example, the CFPB issued its anticipated Larger Participant Rule, effective January 2025, allowing the CFPB to conduct supervisory activities over general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject certain of our payments products to this authority. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We have received certain",

For  ex ample, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target  and  measure  ads  effectively,  while  expanding  their  own  advertising business. In addition, G oogle previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, G oogle's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we  do  not  control,  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  and  browser  developers.  We  may  not  be  successful  in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create  successful  new  products,  both  independently  and  in  conjunction  with  developers  or  other  third  parties.  We  may  introduce  significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For ex ample, we continue to launch new AI features on our products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\n\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and Instagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney G eneral is seeking to enjoin our offering of default endto-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\n\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance could be harmed.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled \" -Revenue -Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the  U.S. dollar.  For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \" -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Free Cash Flow.\"\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. W e believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\n## Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results\n\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\nOur financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to 2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.\n\nIncome from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.",

      "question": "How does the decline in audience ratings impact Comcast's (CMCSA) advertising revenue, and what mechanism is described in the Media segment for addressing rating shortfalls in guaranteed advertising contracts?",
      "answer": "The decline in audience ratings negatively affects Comcast's advertising revenue because advertisers are less willing to purchase ads when viewership and audience ratings fall. This is due to the reduced effectiveness of advertisements reaching a smaller audience. Additionally, when there is a shortfall in contracts where ratings were guaranteed, Comcast defers a portion of the revenue until the shortfall is resolved, typically by delivering additional advertising units within one year of the original airing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition and audience fragmentation, and that these declines adversely affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from Comcast's Media segment.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we understand the financial mechanism tied to advertising revenue: Comcast guarantees audience ratings in some contracts, and if those ratings are not met, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year."

      "answer": "Comcast capitalizes film and television costs as part of its industry-specific accounting policies, which are tied directly to its activities in producing owned content and licensing third-party content for use across its owned television networks and digital properties. These costs are managed under multiyear distribution agreements, where expenses are generally recognized based on the rates in the agreements. The capitalization and amortization of these costs align with the company's predominant monetization strategy, which focuses on monetizing content on an individual basis.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Comcast capitalizes and amortizes film and television costs as an industry-specific accounting policy, as noted in the discussion under 'Accounting Policies'.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Comcast incurs costs related to both the production of owned content and the licensing of third-party content used on its television networks and digital properties.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The capitalization of film and television costs (from evidence_source_a) directly relates to the company's production and licensing activities (from evidence_source_b), with expenses recognized under multiyear agreements."

      "answer": "From December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, the combined effect of foreign currency translation (-$775 million) and acquisitions (+$21 million) resulted in a net change of -$754 million for Sky's balance. This contributed to the overall decrease in Sky's balance from $29,950 million to $29,196 million (a decrease of $754 million). From December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, foreign currency translation added $1,489 million to Sky's balance, which increased from $28,461 million to $29,950 million \u2014 a total increase of $1,489 million. Therefore, the impact of these factors on Sky's balance reversed between the two periods: a positive contribution in 2019\u20132020 and a negative contribution in 2020\u20132021.",

        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, the foreign currency translation impact on Sky during 2020\u20132021 was -$775 million, and acquisitions added $21 million.",
        "Step 3: The net effect of these two factors was -$754 million, fully explaining the drop in Sky's balance over that period.",
        "Step 4: From the same table, Sky's balance increased from $28,461 million (December 31, 2019) to $29,950 million (December 31, 2020), a total increase of $1,489 million.",

Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Note 2: Segment Information\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. In 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and  Theme  Parks;  and  (3)  Sky  in  one  reportable  business  segment.  The  changes  reflect  a  reorganized  operating  structure  in NBCUniversal's  television  and  streaming  businesses  and  primarily  include:  (i)  the  combination  of  NBCUniversal's  television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal's television studio production operations (previously  reported  in  Cable  Networks  and  Broadcast  Television)  with  the  studio  operations  of  Filmed  Entertainment  in  the Studios segment. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. See Note 3 for a description of the various products and services within each reportable segment.\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives including our new Sky Glass and XClass TV smart television product launches.\n\nOur financial  data  by  reportable  segment  is  presented  in  the  tables  below.  We  do  not  present  a  measure  of  total  assets  for  our reportable business segments as this information is not used by management to allocate resources and capital.\n\n",

      "answer": "Verizon's Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables grew by $1,238 million in 2024 ($19,766 million in 2024 - $18,528 million in 2023 = $1,238 million). The growth could be explained by Verizon\u2019s credit classification system, which allows for differentiated credit offers based on whether a customer is 'established' or 'short-tenured.' For 'short-tenured customers,' where traditional credit reports may not be available, Verizon uses alternative credit data for risk assessment, potentially enabling broader access to device payment plans and contributing to the increase in receivables.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables were $19,766 million in 2024 and $18,528 million in 2023, indicating a year-over-year increase of $1,238 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Verizon classifies customers as 'established' or 'short-tenured' and uses alternative credit data when traditional credit reports are unavailable, especially for short-tenured customers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables could be attributed to Verizon\u2019s credit policy that allows more customers, including those with limited credit history, to qualify for payment plans by using alternative data, thereby expanding the customer base and increasing receivables."

A s a result of this experience, we make initial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \"established customer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources.\n\nAvailable external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with internal data are used to create custom credit risk scores for Consumer customers. The custom credit risk score is generated automatically from the applicant's credit data using proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history . In those instances, alternativ e credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify the existence of the business with external data sources.\n\nBased on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This includes an account level spending limit and a maximum amount of credit allowed per device for Consumer customers or a required down payment percentage for Business customers.\n\n## Credit Quality Information\n\nSubsequent to origination,  we  assess  indicators  for  the  quality  of  our  wireless  device  payment  plan  agreement  portfolio  using  two  models,  one  for  new customers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business wireless customers based on less than 210 days as  \"new  customers.\"  The  model  for  existing  customers  pools  all  Consumer  and  Business  wireless  customers  based  on 210  days  or  more  as  \"existing customers.\"\n\nThe following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, and gross write-offs recorded, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, by credit quality indicator and year of origination:\n\n",

These adjustments result in a final income before taxes of $26,947 million from an operating income of $23,347 million after additional reconciling items.

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The 'Eliminations and consolidations' adjustment also appears in the operating income reconciliation, where it reduces operating income by $820 million to $23,347 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - By tracing the impact of eliminations and consolidations through both tables, we see that despite reducing segment contribution and operating income, the final income before taxes increases to $26,947 million due to other income and expense items."

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n## 2. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

This contrasts with the prior two years, where the company experienced a loss of $431 million in 2022 and no activity in 2021.

During the same period, total current assets decreased by $7,522 million, from $32,763 million to $25,241 million, representing a 22.96% decrease.

      "answer": "Elevated labor costs are expected to remain a persistent expense for Disney, increasing the cost of producing and distributing content for DTC services. At the same time, a strong U.S. dollar suppresses international demand for Disney's domestic products and services, including content on DTC platforms, reducing revenue potential in key global markets. Additionally, the competitive environment for DTC services places downward pressure on pricing, limiting Disney\u2019s ability to raise prices or requiring promotional pricing to retain subscribers. Together, these factors\u2014rising costs, reduced international revenue, and pricing constraints\u2014collectively compress the operating margin for Disney's DTC streaming services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Labor costs are expected to remain elevated, increasing the cost of content production and distribution for DTC offerings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - A strong U.S. dollar reduces international demand for Disney's domestic products and services, including DTC content, lowering potential revenue.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - Competitive pressures in the DTC market may require Disney to lower prices or forgo increases, directly limiting revenue growth potential.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The combination of higher operating costs (from labor), lower international revenue (from dollar strength), and constrained pricing (from competition) collectively reduce the operating margin of Disney's DTC streaming services."
