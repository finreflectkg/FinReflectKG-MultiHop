The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition.

M ost of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase",

      "answer": "The number of anti-dilutive equity awards excluded decreased from 400 in fiscal year 2023 to 51 in fiscal year 2025. This represents a percentage decrease of 87.25%. The significant decline suggests that fewer equity awards were anti-dilutive in their impact on net income per share, potentially indicating improved stock price performance or changes in the terms of equity compensation that made more awards dilutive.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The number of anti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share in fiscal year 2023 was 400.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The number of anti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share in fiscal year 2025 was 51.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage change: ((400 - 51) / 400) * 100 = 87.25% decrease.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the trend - A large decrease in excluded anti-dilutive awards suggests changes in equity award structures or improved stock price performance, making fewer awards anti-dilutive."
