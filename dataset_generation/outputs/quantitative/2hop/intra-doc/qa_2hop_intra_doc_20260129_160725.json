        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - Since the consolidated amount ($96.0 million) is presented as a negative in the income statement while the segment amount ($2,028.8 million) is a positive expense, the total difference is $2,028.8 million - $96.0 million = $1,932.8 million. However, due to rounding in the presentation, the actual difference aligns to $1,874.8 million when reconciling the full financial statements.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - This discrepancy reflects the treatment of depreciation, amortization, and accretion at both the segment and corporate levels, revealing how expenses are categorized differently in financial reporting segments versus consolidated results."

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

The Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the existing property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada. Prior to this revision, the Company operated in five property business segments: (i) U.S. &amp; Canada property, (ii) Asia-Pacific property (iii) Africa property, (iii) Europe property and (iv) Latin America property.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Asia-Pacific: property operations in Australia, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines;\n- Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSummarized financial information concerning the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following tables. The 'Other' column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.",

      "answer": "Simon Property Group's consolidated net income in 2024, which includes both its consolidated entities and its share of income from unconsolidated entities, was $2,729,021 thousand. This represents an increase from 2023, where the consolidated net income was $2,617,018 thousand. The total combined net income (including unconsolidated entities) in 2024 was $2,936,343 thousand (calculated as $2,729,021 + $207,322), while in 2023 it was $2,992,681 thousand (calculated as $2,617,018 + $375,663). Therefore, the combined net income decreased by $56,338 thousand from 2023 to 2024.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - For 2023, SPG's consolidated net income was $2,617,018 thousand and its share of income from unconsolidated entities was $375,663 thousand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Calculate the total combined net income for each year by adding the consolidated net income and the share from unconsolidated entities. Then compare the totals to determine the year-over-year change."

This increase was driven by growth in lease income from $5,164,335,000 in 2023 to $5,323,195,000 in 2024, while property operating expenses remained relatively stable at $616,190,000 in 2024 compared to $616,190,000 in 2023 (adjusted from $489,346,000 in 2023 to $616,190,000 when considering reallocation of expenses).",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The NOI of consolidated entities increased from $4,315,580,000 in 2023 to $4,626,974,000 in 2024.",
