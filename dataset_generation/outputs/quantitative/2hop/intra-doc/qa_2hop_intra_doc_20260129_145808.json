The Total Current Assets decreased from $21,442 million in fiscal 2023 to $19,071 million in fiscal 2024, representing a decrease of $2,371 million.

In contrast, Automotive Sales increased by $11,299 million, or 17%, from $67,210 million in 2022 to $78,509 million in 2023. This indicates that while Tesla's core automotive sales grew significantly, its leasing revenue declined year-over-year.",

      "answer": "The total aggregate release date fair value of RSUs for Tesla over the three-year period ending December 31, 2023, is $12.52 billion ($2.50 billion in 2023 + $4.32 billion in 2022 + $5.70 billion in 2021). The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the same period is $29.11 billion ($1.33 billion in 2023 + $1.90 billion in 2022 + $26.88 billion in 2021). Therefore, the intrinsic value of exercised stock options is significantly higher than the RSU release value over this period.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Summing the RSU values ($2.50B + $4.32B + $5.70B) gives $12.52 billion. Summing the stock option intrinsic values ($1.33B + $1.90B + $26.88B) gives $29.11 billion. This comparison highlights the disparity between RSU release value and stock option exercise value."

During the same period, the cost of Automotive Leasing revenues decreased by $241 million. The drop in leasing revenues had a larger impact on revenue than the corresponding drop in costs, resulting in a net negative effect on profitability.",

        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, Automotive Leasing cost of revenues decreased from $1,509 million in 2022 to $1,268 million in 2023, a decline of $241 million.",
        "Step 3: The revenue decline ($356 million) outpaced the cost decline ($241 million), leading to a net negative impact on gross profit from automotive leasing activities."

      "answer": "The increase in Model 3 and Model Y deliveries contributed to a $12.72 billion increase in the cost of automotive sales revenue in 2021. This was primarily driven by the cost components including direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead (including depreciation of tooling and machinery), shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to the Supercharger network. Additionally, the net release of the sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees added $286 million to the cost of automotive sales revenue.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, the cost of automotive sales revenue increased by $12.72 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, the net release of the sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees added $286 million to the cost of automotive sales revenue.",

          "chunk_text": "We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $399 million and $187 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $93 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2021, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $152 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $9 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 26 years.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Leasing\n\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $198 million and $206 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term.

Additionally, the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of $286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of Model S and Model X. Additionally, there was a decrease in combined average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity, where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in China.",

Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue increased $12.72 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. Additionally, the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of $286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary under-utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of Model S and Model X. Additionally, there was a decrease in combined average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity, where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in China.",

      "answer": "Tesla ensures the reasonableness of its $2.101 billion automotive warranty reserve by combining historical claims data with independent analysis. The company evaluates the nature, frequency, and costs of future claims using historical performance data, including a lookback analysis comparing prior forecasts to actual claims. Additionally, auditors developed an independent estimate of a portion of the reserve and compared it to Tesla's own estimate to validate its accuracy. This dual approach strengthens the reliability of the warranty liability assessment.",

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Automotive Warranty Reserve\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $2,101 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company provides a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management's best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty, including recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

This is an increase from the prior fiscal year-end, October 1, 2023, where the fair value totaled $107.5 million, consisting of $2.8 million in short-term investments and $104.7 million in long-term investments.

      "answer": "The total value of Lowe's merchandise inventory for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 combined is $34,303 million ($17,409 million in 2025 + $16,894 million in 2024). The change in merchandise inventory negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities by $514 million in fiscal 2025 compared to a positive impact of $1,637 million in fiscal 2024, resulting in a net cash outflow effect of $2,151 million when comparing the two years.",

        "Step 1: Extract merchandise inventory values for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 from evidence_source_b - $17,409 million and $16,894 million respectively.",
        "Step 2: Calculate total merchandise inventory by summing the two values - $17,409 million + $16,894 million = $34,303 million.",
        "Step 3: Extract the impact of merchandise inventory changes on operating cash flows from evidence_source_a - (514) million for fiscal 2025 and 1,637 million for fiscal 2024.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the net effect of inventory changes on operating cash flows - (514) million + 1,637 million = 1,123 million net positive impact over the two years. However, since the question asks 'how did the change in merchandise inventory impact' we note the negative impact in 2025 and positive impact in 2024, resulting in a $2,151 million swing."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and ex penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.

This required an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the vendor funds were completely and accurately recorded in accordance with the vendor agreements.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to whether the vendor funds were completely and accurately recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over vendor funds, including management's controls over the identification of vendor agreements as well as the accrual and recording of vendor funds as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned, and as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventory is sold.\n- We selected a sample of vendor funds and recalculated the amount earned using the terms of the vendor agreement, including the amount recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory when earned, and the amount recorded as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventory is sold.\n- We selected a sample of vendor funds and sent confirmations to test the completeness of programs as well as the accuracy of amounts earned and terms of the agreement directly with the vendor.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina March 24, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1962.",

      "question": "How much did Amazon's principal repayments of finance leases decrease from 2023 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's leasing obligations during this period?",
      "answer": "Amazon's principal repayments of finance leases decreased by $2,341 million (from $4,384 million in 2023 to $2,043 million in 2024). This indicates a reduction in the company's leasing obligations over the period, suggesting either fewer lease commitments or extended repayment schedules.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document defines 'Principal repayments of finance leases' as part of the company's broader free cash flow reconciliation and highlights its inclusion in financial reporting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The specific values for principal repayments of finance leases are $4,384 million in 2023 and $2,043 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference between the two values ($4,384M - $2,043M = $2,341M) reveals a significant decline in Amazon's leasing repayments, which reflects a change in leasing activity or financial structure."

This value is reflected in the reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations, where it is treated as if the assets had been purchased with cash, even though they were leased.

For ex ample, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time.

During the same period, the property and equipment acquired under finance leases decreased from $675 million in 2022 to $642 million in 2023, a difference of $33 million.

      "answer": "The $15,436.5 million in 2023 revenues from franchised restaurants represents the sum of rents, royalties, and initial fees collected by McDonald's, which are derived from franchised sales. According to the disclosure, franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by McDonald's but are instead the basis on which franchised revenues are calculated. This indicates that the $15,436.5 million in franchised revenues is directly tied to the volume and health of franchised sales, which in turn reflect the financial health of the franchisee base. Thus, the high franchised revenue figure suggests strong underlying franchised sales performance, even though the company does not record those sales directly as revenues.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company but are the basis for calculating franchised revenues and indicate the financial health of the franchisee base.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $15,436.5 million franchised revenue figure is derived from franchised sales, which are not recorded as revenues directly by McDonald's. This revenue amount, therefore, serves as a proxy for the scale and health of franchised sales, which the company explicitly states are indicative of franchisee financial health."

      "answer": "The year-over-year change in General Motors' Equity in Net Assets of Nonconsolidated Affiliates for the Total segment is an increase of $437 million (from $10,176 million in 2022 to $10,613 million in 2023). In contrast, the GMI segment experienced a decrease of $343 million (from $6,691 million in 2022 to $6,348 million in 2023). Therefore, while the overall Total segment increased, the GMI segment specifically declined in terms of Equity in Net Assets of Nonconsolidated Affiliates.",

      "answer": "GM's Automotive net sales grew from $113,590 million in 2021 to $157,658 million in 2023, representing a growth of $44,068 million (38.8%). GM Financial's net sales slightly declined from $13,414 million in 2021 to $14,184 million in 2023, an increase of $770 million (5.7%). In 2023, Automotive accounted for 91.7% of total consolidated net sales, while GM Financial contributed only 8.3%, highlighting the dominance of the Automotive segment in GM's revenue base.",

        "Step 1: Extract GM's Automotive net sales for 2021 ($113,590 million) and 2023 ($157,658 million) from evidence_source_a.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the growth in Automotive net sales: $157,658 - $113,590 = $44,068 million, which is a 38.8% increase.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the growth in GM Financial net sales: $14,184 - $13,414 = $770 million, which is a 5.7% increase.",
        "Step 5: Extract the 2023 breakdown of net sales by segment from evidence_source_b, where Automotive is $127,472 million (U.S.) + $30,186 million (Non-U.S.) = $157,658 million and GM Financial is $12,133 million (U.S.) + $2,051 million (Non-U.S.) = $14,184 million.",
        "Step 6: Calculate the percentage contribution of each segment to total consolidated net sales in 2023: Automotive = $157,658 / $171,842 = 91.7%, GM Financial = $14,184 / $171,842 = 8.3%.",
        "Step 7: Synthesize the results: The Automotive segment experienced significant growth and dominated total net sales, while GM Financial's contribution was minimal and showed only slight growth."

          "chunk_text": "## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes to those statements, and the Section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any forward-looking statements, which may be due to factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We connect consumers who wish to make travel reservations with travel service providers around the world through our online platforms. Consumers can also use our meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. We also offer various other services to consumers and partners, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services to restaurants.\n\nWe offer these services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. We continue to increase the collaboration, cooperation, and interdependency among our brands to provide consumers with the most comprehensive services. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Reporting for information on our operating segments.\n\nThe results of our business outside of the U.S. consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and the parts of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of our businesses outside of the U.S. In 2021, the revenues from our businesses outside of the U.S. (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com through facilitating accommodation reservations) represented approximately 87% of our consolidated revenues. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.\n\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services, restaurant reservations and restaurant management services, and various other services, such as travelrelated insurance revenues.\n\n## Trends\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of travel restrictions by governments around the world resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. Accommodation room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, declined rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic spread in the first quarter of 2020 and the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and through 2021, accommodation room night declines versus the comparable period in 2019 have generally improved as government-imposed travel restrictions have eased, vaccines and other medical interventions have become more widespread, and consumer demand for travel has started to rebound. However, there have been periods of worsening trends due to spikes in COVID-19 cases and newly implemented travel restrictions, primarily related to new variants.",

We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions that prevent or reduce the impact of COVID-19 become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is dependent on the availability of a large number of accommodations (particularly independently-owned accommodations) and restaurants, and on the ability of consumers to travel to such accommodations and restaurants on airlines, railways, and rental cars. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by the various travel restrictions between countries. We do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel, and our travel service provider and restaurant partners are able to meet the demand for services. This may not occur until well after the broader global economy begins to improve. Additionally, our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns. Any increased unemployment is likely to have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending, including for the travel and restaurant industries. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.\n\nOur financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent, and duration of the global pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic; availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19, and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly; actions taken by national, state, and local governments to contain the disease or treat its impact; the impact on attrition, as well as the changes in hiring levels and remote working arrangements that we have implemented on our operations, including the health and productivity of management and our employees, and our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls; the impact on our contracts and relationships with our partners; our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks; the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem; and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including how long it takes to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world, which could continue to affect our business. Also, restrictions in affected regions could be extended after the virus has been contained in order to avoid relapses and there may be restrictions on certain travel activity related to whether travelers have been vaccinated. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also heighten many of the other risks identified in this section.\n\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. We had approximately 20,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2021. Our future success and ability to innovate and develop products, services, technologies, and enhancements depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees across our organization, and changes in our workforce may make that more difficult. In addition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support, particularly during peak periods. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry, it is possible our employees may not view employment with us as positively as they did prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have a long-term effect on how and from where people work, the attractiveness of our office environments, and remote working policies, and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in the",

Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services.\n\nThe extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments.

Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole.\n\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels or our industry, our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants than those we are currently subject to, which could restrict our business operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $14.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $7.4 billion is held by our international subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, and Euros. Cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments are principally comprised of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit, convertible debt securities of Trip.com Group, equity securities of Meituan, Grab, and DiDi, and our investments in private companies (see Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In December 2021, we redeemed our December 2015 investment of $500 million in Trip.com Group's convertible senior notes (see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $912 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which included $825 million reported as \"Long-term U.S. transition tax liability\" and $87 million included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next five years. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us.\n\nIn August 2019, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of up to $80 million of letters of credit as well as borrowings of up to $100 million on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans. The proceeds of loans made under the facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayments. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $4 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow thereunder. In 2020, we amended the revolving credit facility to (i) suspend the maximum leverage ratio covenant through and including the three months ending March 31, 2022, which was replaced with a $4.5 billion minimum liquidity covenant based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio from and including the three months ending June 30, 2022 through and including the three months ending March 31, 2023. We agreed not to declare or make any cash distribution and not to repurchase any of our shares (with certain exceptions including in connection with tax withholding related to shares issued to employees) unless (i) prior to the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we have at least $6.0 billion of liquidity on a pro forma basis, based on unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility and (ii) after the delivery of financial statements for the three months ending June 30, 2022, we are in compliance on a pro forma basis with the maximum leverage ratio covenant then in effect.

(\"Booking Holdings\" or the \"Company\") seeks to make it easier for everyone to experience the world by providing consumers, travel service providers, and restaurants with leading travel and restaurant online reservation and related services. The Company offers its services through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable, which allow consumers to: book a broad array of accommodations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels, and other alternative and traditional accommodations properties) and a flight to their destinations; make a car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi; make a dinner reservation; or book a vacation package, tour, activity, or cruise. Consumers can also use the Company's meta-search services to easily compare travel reservation information, such as flight, hotel, and rental car reservations from hundreds of online travel platforms at once. In addition, the Company offers other services to consumers, travel service providers and restaurants, such as travel-related insurance products and restaurant management services.\n\n## 2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. The estimates underlying the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements relate to, among other things, the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets, the valuation of investments in private companies, income taxes, contingencies, stock-based compensation, the allowance for expected credit losses (also referred to as allowance for doubtful accounts), chargeback provisions and the accrual of obligations for loyalty and other incentive programs.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nIn response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19 (the \"COVID-19 pandemic\"), as well as subsequent outbreaks driven by new variants of COVID-19, governments and businesses around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of restricted measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have had a significant adverse effect on many of the customers on whom the Company's business relies, including hotels and other accommodation providers, airlines and restaurants, as well as the Company's workforce, operations and consumers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of restrictive measures resulted in a significant decline in travel activities and consumer demand for related services in 2020 in particular. The Company's financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The spread of new variants of COVID-19 has caused uncertainty as to when restrictions will be lifted, if additional restrictions may be initiated or reimposed, if there will be permanent changes to travel behavior patterns, and the timing of distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical interventions globally.\n\nIn 2020, given the severe downturn in the global travel industry and the financial difficulties faced by many of the Company's travel service provider and restaurant customers and marketing affiliates, the Company increased its provision for expected credit losses (also referred to as provision for bad debts or provision for uncollectible accounts) on receivables from and prepayments to its travel service provider and restaurant customers and marketing affiliates (see Note 7). Moreover, due to the high level of cancellations of existing reservations, the Company incurred higher than normal cash outlays to refund consumers for prepaid reservations, including certain situations where the Company had already transferred the prepayment to the travel service provider (see Note 3). In 2021, based on its review of recent historical credit loss experience and stability in the economic conditions in certain markets, the Company revised its estimates of expected credit losses (see Note 7). Any significant increase in the Company's provision for expected credit losses and any significant increase in cash outlays to refund consumers would have a corresponding adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and related cash flows.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

This increase was a significant contributor to the overall growth in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2022. Specifically, the rise in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments aimed at supporting heightened digital demand, which directly influenced the increase in selling and administrative expense.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The text states that 'Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The table provides exact figures for demand creation expense: $3,114 million in fiscal 2021 and $3,850 million in fiscal 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "\nAs discussed previously, our NIKE Brand business in Brazil transitioned to a distributor operating model during fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our legal entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as our legal entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of our legal entities in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay will remain classified as heldfor-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The impacts of closing the Brazil transaction as well as classifying the Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay entities as held-for-sale in fiscal 2020 are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results. For more information see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2022. The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories, driven by SOCO (which comprises Argentina, Chile and Uruguay), Mexico and Korea, which increased 58%, 35% and 16%, respectively. Revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 51% and comparable store sales growth of 13%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, partially offset by store closures.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2022 in part due to higher revenues in Women's and Men's. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 15 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher NIKE Direct ASP, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, higher off-price ASP and a higher mix of fullprice sales. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 3%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 9 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct and off-price ASPs. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.\n\nReported EBIT increased 24% for fiscal 2022, as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 400 basis points primarily due to higher margins and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP largely due to lower discounts, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower other costs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to lower warehousing costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in NIKE Direct variable expenses as well as higher bad debt expense.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 40",

          "chunk_text": "## CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS\n\nA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS\n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 48",

In contrast, the North America region alone saw a 14.8% increase in footwear revenue during the same period. This indicates that the North America market outperformed the global footwear segment.",

        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Footwear revenue in the North America region increased from $12,997 million in fiscal 2023 (calculated as $11,273M wholesale + $10,335M direct - $2,695M direct already included in total) to $14,897 million in fiscal 2024, representing a 14.8% change.",

The percentage point difference between North America's wholesale growth and global wholesale growth was 0.7 points.",

        "Step 3: Calculate global wholesale growth using evidence_source_b: Global Sales to Wholesale Customers were $27,758 million in fiscal 2024, up from $26,437 million in fiscal 2023 (again calculated from the 5% change in global revenues applied to the base year value), resulting in approximately a 4.3% increase.",

      "answer": "Tesla's net investment in operating lease vehicles decreased by $430 million from December 31, 2023 ($7.36 billion gross cost - $1.38 billion accumulated depreciation = $5.98 billion net) to December 31, 2024 ($7.03 billion gross cost - $1.45 billion accumulated depreciation = $5.58 billion net). This decrease of $430 million in net investment contributed to a positive cash flow of $590 million in operating activities related to operating lease vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The gross cost of operating lease vehicles was $7.03 billion as of December 31, 2024, with accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion, resulting in a net investment of $5.58 billion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in ex cess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for ex cess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is writtendown, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.03 billion and $7.36 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nWe account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets . We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Periods prior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their acquisition.\n\nWe determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ('ASC 820'), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We determine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are now recorded to Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.",

      "answer": "The increase in revenue from non-warranty maintenance services contributed to a $2.22 billion overall increase in Services and Other Revenue in 2024, while automotive leasing revenue decreased by $293 million during the same period. Therefore, the increase in Services and Other Revenue (driven by non-warranty maintenance services among other factors) exceeded the leasing revenue decline by $1.927 billion. This reflects Tesla's strategic shift toward offering leasing through commercial banking partners and expanding its post-sale service offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Leasing Revenue\n\n## Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\n\nOur policy is to ex clude tax es collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases ('ASC 842'), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\n\n## Services and Other Revenue\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\n\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Sales\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.",

      "answer": "Tesla's deferred revenue related to customer prepayments increased from $1.60 billion in 2023 to $1.77 billion in 2024, indicating stronger prepayment activity and potential growth in contracted energy storage projects. Meanwhile, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives remained immaterial in both years, suggesting that government incentives did not significantly influence deferred revenue growth.

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in customer prepayments indicates stronger contract inflows and business activity in 2024, while the immaterial level of rebates suggests that growth was driven by commercial demand rather than government incentives."

Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\n\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are ex pensed as incurred.\n\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original ex pected length of more than one year was $7.18 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the nex t 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\n\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $658 million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Leasing\n\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $164 million and $181 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.",

Of this amount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the nex t 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\n\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $658 million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Leasing\n\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases . Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $164 million and $181 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.",

This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $2.29 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $623 million.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital ex penditures, which were $11.34 billion and $8.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital ex penditures, global factory ex pansion and machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also purchased $7.45 billion and $6.62 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash flows from financing activities increased by $1.26 billion to $3.85 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.81 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, partially offset by a $1.15 billion increase in repayments of debt. See Note 10, Debt , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Additionally, there was an increase of $541 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances compared to the prior year.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\nOur CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The CODM uses gross profit to allocate operating and capital resources and assesses performance of each segment by comparing actual gross profit results to historical results and previously forecasted financial information.

Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\n\nOur policy is to ex clude tax es collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program\n\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases ('ASC 842'), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\n\n## Services and Other Revenue\n\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\n\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Sales\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.",

The Company believes this Strategy builds on our inherent strengths by harnessing our competitive advantages while leveraging our size, scale and agility to adapt and adjust to operating conditions and consumer demands. These efforts, coupled with investment in innovation, are designed to enhance the customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth, which is aligned with the Company's capital allocation philosophy of investing in new restaurants and opportunities to grow the business, reinvesting in existing restaurants, and returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nBased on current conditions, the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's results for 2022.\n\n- The Company expects net restaurant unit expansion will contribute about 1.5% to 2022 Systemwide sales growth, in constant currencies.\n- The Company expects full year 2022 selling, general &amp; administrative expenses of between 2.2% and 2.3% of Systemwide sales.\n- The Company expects operating margin percent to be in the low-to-mid 40% range.\n- Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2022 to be relatively flat to 2021.\n- Under current tax legislation, the Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the 20% to 22% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.\n- The Company expects 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 to $2.4 billion, about half of which will be directed towards new restaurant unit expansion across the U.S. and International Operated Markets. About 40% will be dedicated to the U.S. business, most of which will go towards reinvestment, including the completion of restaurant modernization efforts. Globally, the Company expects to open over 1,800 restaurants. The Company will open over 500 restaurants in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments, and developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards over 1,300 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects over 1,400 net restaurant additions in 2022.\n- The Company expects to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate greater than 90%.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 10",

Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of the Company's business.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n\nUnconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in (earnings) losses from these entities representing McDonald's share of results for markets in both the International Operated Markets and International Developmental Licensed Markets segments. For foreign affiliated markets - primarily China and Japan- results are reported after interest expense and income taxes.\n\n## \u00b7 Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net\n\nAsset dispositions and other (income) expense, net consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings, reserves for bad debts, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, strategic sale of properties, and other miscellaneous income and expenses.\n\n## \u00b7 Impairment and other charges (gains), net\n\nImpairment and other charges (gains), net includes losses that result from the write down of goodwill and long-lived assets from their carrying value to their fair value, as well as charges associated with strategic initiatives, such as refranchising and restructuring activities. The realized gains/losses from the divestiture of ownership percentages of subsidiaries are reflected in this category, including the gains on sale of McDonald's Japan stock in 2020 and 2021, which reduced the Company's ownership in McDonald's Japan from 49% to 35%.",

The company analyzed comparable sales growth on a two-year basis due to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, which made the year-over-year growth potentially misleading as a measure of underlying business performance, and instead wanted to compare 2021 results against a more normalized baseline from 2019.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Systemwide sales increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $112.5 billion' which provides the specific Systemwide sales growth percentage from 2020 to 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'Due to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, comparable sales growth from 2020 to 2021 may not be fully indicative of the Company's performance. Therefore in 2021, management also analyzed comparable sales growth on a two-year basis as a metric to compare results for 2021 against more normalized sales performance in 2019.' This explains why the company shifted to a two-year comparable sales analysis.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS\n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.\n\n- Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n- Comparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19). Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n- Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n- The Company's after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.\n- Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate.\n\n## 2021 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2021, global comparable sales increased 17.0%, primarily due to strong sales performance across all segments from continued execution of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, as well as recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year.\n\n- Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 13.8%, benefiting primarily from strong average check growth, successful menu and marketing promotions and growth in digital channels, which benefited from the launch of the Company's loyalty program.\n- Comparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 21.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all markets, primarily driven by the U.K. and France.\n- Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment increased 16.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all geographic regions.\n\nIn addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results in 2021:\n\n- Consolidated revenues increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $23.2 billion.\n- Systemwide sales increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $112.5 billion.\n- Consolidated operating income increased 41% (38% in constant currencies) to $10.4 billion. Refer to the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\n- Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 38.1% in 2020 to 44.6% in 2021. Excluding net strategic gains detailed in the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K, operating margin increased from 36.7% in 2020 to 43.4% in 2021.\n- Diluted earnings per share of $10.04 increased 59% (56% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 12 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 8",

This was driven by semiconductor supply constraints that led to decreased sales of lower-margin crossover vehicles and passenger cars\u2014both with variable profits of about 40%\u2014and increased focus on vehicles with significantly higher profitability. As a result, the favorable mix was one of the primary drivers behind the increase in EBIT-Adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

This obligation is partially reflected in the demand creation expense, which totaled $4,285 million for the year ended May 31, 2024. Endorsement payments are generally expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, contributing significantly to this expense.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The total endorsement contract obligation is $10.6 billion as of May 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Demand creation expense for the year ended May 31, 2024, was $4,285 million, with a significant portion resulting from payments under endorsement contracts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $10.6 billion endorsement obligation directly influences the demand creation expense, a portion of which is recognized annually. For the year in question, this expense was $4,285 million."

      "answer": "Booking.com's strategy to improve performance marketing ROI could negatively impact gross bookings growth. This is because pursuing higher ROIs may reduce the volume of traffic acquired through paid marketing channels, which are already less likely to convert to bookings compared to direct traffic. Additionally, increased consumer shopping activity before making a travel purchase impedes marketing efficiency, as traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation. These factors, combined with external pressures such as competition for search rankings and fluctuating cost-per-click rates, could lead to slower growth rates for both marketing channels and gross bookings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, gross bookings is defined as the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through Booking.com's online travel companies (OTC) brands, net of cancellations.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Booking.com notes that pursuing a strategy of improving performance marketing ROIs may negatively affect gross bookings growth rates.",
        "Step 3: Evidence_source_b also states that increased consumer shopping activity before making a travel purchase impedes marketing efficiency, as traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through the platforms.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The explicit statement that improving marketing ROI may negatively affect gross bookings growth, combined with the definition of gross bookings and the explanation of how shopping behavior affects marketing efficiency, creates a causal chain showing how marketing strategy and consumer behavior could constrain gross bookings growth."

      "answer": "Increased consumer shopping activity before making travel purchases could impede Booking Holdings' marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through its platforms. This traffic is also more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels rather than direct channels. This dynamic could reduce conversion rates and increase reliance on paid marketing, which is more costly and less efficient. In 2022, the company saw a significant increase in room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through its services due to improving travel demand trends, which contributed to gross bookings growth. If this marketing inefficiency persists, it could undermine the company's ability to sustain the strong growth trajectory in gross bookings observed in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through Booking Holdings' services increased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, indicating strong gross bookings growth.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Increased consumer shopping activity before making a travel purchase impedes marketing efficiency because traffic is less likely to convert to bookings and is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If Booking Holdings experiences increased consumer research and comparison shopping before purchases, it may lead to reduced conversion rates and higher marketing costs. This could threaten the company's ability to sustain the gross bookings growth seen in 2022."

      "answer": "Booking Holdings' strategy to improve performance marketing ROI may lead to a reduction in marketing spend or shifts in marketing tactics that could lower the volume of new bookings, thereby negatively impacting gross bookings growth. In 2023, gross bookings represented 14.2% of total revenues ($21,365 million), meaning that any slowdown in gross bookings growth could have a measurable effect on overall revenue growth. This conflict arises because improving ROI may require focusing on higher-converting, more expensive channels or reducing spend in less effective areas, which can limit the reach of marketing efforts and thus slow gross bookings growth.",

      "answer": "Booking.com's total revenue yield declined from 14.3% in 2021 to 14.1% in 2022. This was driven by two key factors: (1) a shift in the composition of gross bookings toward airline tickets, which typically yield lower revenue percentages, and (2) declining marketing efficiency influenced by factors such as foreign exchange rates, cancellation rates, and cost-per-click increases. These dynamics reduced the effectiveness of marketing spend in generating new bookings, which, when combined with the lower-yielding nature of airline bookings, led to a lower overall revenue yield.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that total revenues as a percentage of gross bookings decreased from 14.3% in 2021 to 14.1% in 2022, with the decline attributed to increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of airline ticket gross bookings.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, extract that declining marketing efficiency \u2014 influenced by foreign exchange rates, cancellation rates, and cost-per-click \u2014 could negatively impact gross bookings and revenue growth.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that both the structural shift toward lower-yield airline bookings and reduced marketing ROI contributed to the decline in revenue yield, as both directly affect the company's ability to convert gross bookings into revenue at prior rates."

This new authorization replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in February 2019, and does not have a prescribed expiration date. During fiscal 2021, we had cash payments of $14.8 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. The amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions.\n\n## Debt\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had commercial paper programs that allowed for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. In connection with these programs, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion at January 30, 2022, which consisted of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2023 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2022. In December 2021, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from December 2021 to December 2022. At January 30, 2022, there were $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\n\nWe also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In September 2021, we issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, and the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. We also repaid $1.35 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2021. At January 30, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $36.4 billion, with $2.3 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $20.9 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.\n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe use operating and finance leases to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate lease obligations of $12.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include $1.3 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases.\n\n## Purchase Obligations and Other\n\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software acquisitions, license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $570 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The volume-driven revenue decline of $1.6 billion contributed significantly to the overall $2.059 billion unfavorable variance in revenue, which in turn led to a sharp drop in EBIT-adjusted margin percentage, reflecting reduced profitability relative to sales."

      "answer": "The total impairment and restructuring-related charges recorded by GM's Automotive China JVs and GM Financial in 2024 were $2.3 billion. This includes $2.0 billion of charges recorded by the China JVs and a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge recorded by GM Financial. These charges were connected through GM Financial's investment in SAIC-GMAC, which was negatively impacted by the broader restructuring and market challenges affecting the China JVs. GM Financial's impairment was directly tied to the fair value write-down of its SAIC-GMAC investment, which was influenced by the same market conditions and operational difficulties impacting the China joint ventures.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",
