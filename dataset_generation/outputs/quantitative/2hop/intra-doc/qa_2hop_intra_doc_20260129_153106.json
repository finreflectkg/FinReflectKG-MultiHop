      "answer": "The increase in Executive Membership fees is expected to contribute approximately $190 million in additional revenue during fiscal 2025. This increase is linked to the high global member renewal rate of 90.5% and the strong penetration of Executive memberships, which accounted for approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).",

Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basispoint  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  driven  by  decreases  in  fresh  foods  and  foods  and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted  by  one  basis  point  due  to  increased  2%  rewards.  Warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the  negative  impact  of  a  one-time  charge  related  to  granting  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off. Changes in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  gross  margin  by  approximately  $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses.

Upon  completion,  a  determination  as  to  the  useful  life  is  performed  and  the  intangible  asset  is  accounted  for  as  a  definite-lived intangible asset. Both the indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if indicators exist. In an asset acquisition, the initial cost to acquire the IPR&amp;D is ex pensed in the consolidated statements of earnings when the project has no alternative future use. PMI records these costs within marketing, administration and research costs in its consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Stock-based compensation\n\nPMI measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the compensation costs over the service periods for awards expected to vest. PMI's accounting policy is to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the expense when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition.

(formerly, V ectura G roup plc, and hereinafter referred to as 'V ectura' or \"V ectura G roup\") to Molex  Asia Holdings Ltd. (\"Molex \"), subject  to  customary  regulatory  approval  and  other  completion  conditions.  On  December  31,  2024,  PMI  completed  the  sale  of  V ectura  for  an  upfront  cash consideration of GBP 152 million (approximately $191 million) and a short-term receivable of GBP 24 million (approximately $30 million), reflecting certain customary completion account adjustments, with additional deferred payments of up to GBP 148 million (approximately $186 million), contingent on achievement of certain milestones over periods up to and through 2039. In addition, PMI agreed to indemnify Molex for certain claims related to the pre-completion period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, no liability has been recorded in relation to the indemnity.\n\nAs of September 17, 2024, and through the completion date, V ectura's net assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale in PMI's consolidated balance sheet. The sale resulted in a pre-tax  loss of $199 million ($206 million including the tax  costs), of which $198 million of loss related to the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2024, to record the net assets held-for-sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. This amount also included reclassification of currency translation losses from other comprehensive losses of $16 million.  The loss on  sale  of  V ectura  has  been  recorded  in marketing, administration and research costs under the Wellness and Healthcare segment in PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## Altria Group, Inc. Agreement\n\nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc.

As a result of PMI reacquiring these rights, effective May 1, 2024 (\"acquisition date\"), PMI holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. As part of the agreement, PMI agreed to pay a total cash consideration of $2.8 billion, including interest, of which $1.0 billion was paid at the inception of the agreement and the remaining $1.8 billion was paid on July 14, 2023. The cash consideration paid was accounted for within Other assets in PMI's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOn the acquisition date and as of December 31, 2024, the reacquired rights were classified as Other intangible assets, net in PMI's consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized over their useful life of 5 years.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nUnited Tobacco Company - In April 2023, PMI acquired 66.73% of Egyptian Investment Holding ('EIH'), a United Arab Emirates based company and as a result, acquired an approximate economic interest of 25% in United Tobacco Company (\"UTC\"), which was",

      "answer": "The decline in gross profit rate for Walmart's International segment by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 contributed to a decrease in segment operating income by $0.8 billion compared to the previous fiscal year. This margin compression was primarily driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China, as well as category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. These factors directly pressured profitability, illustrating the financial impact of strategic and operational shifts in Walmart's international markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract that the gross profit rate for the International segment decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, extract that segment operating income decreased by $0.8 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to the previous year.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the causal relationship: The margin compression (50 basis point decline in gross profit rate) in the International segment directly contributed to the $0.8 billion drop in operating income, showing how operational and strategic factors in international markets affected financial performance."

      "question": "How did the changes in the Gross Profit Rate for fiscal 2023 and 2024 in the Walmart U.S. and International segments collectively impact the overall Gross Profit Rate of Walmart for those years, and what were the primary drivers behind these changes?",
      "answer": "The Gross Profit Rate for Walmart U.S. increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 due to price management and lapping higher markdowns, but was partially offset by product mix shifts. In fiscal 2023, it decreased by 98 basis points due to markdowns, merchandise mix, and supply chain costs. Meanwhile, the International segment saw a 20 basis point increase in Gross Profit Rate in fiscal 2024 driven by supply chain efficiencies, and a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts. These segment-level changes collectively influenced Walmart's overall Gross Profit Rate, which increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 and decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023, showing that the U.S. segment had a stronger recovery in 2024 while International performance remained volatile due to format and channel shifts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The overall Gross Profit Rate increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 and decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023, with the U.S. segment being a key driver in both years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The International segment's Gross Profit Rate increased by 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 due to supply chain efficiencies and decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to lower-margin format growth and category mix shifts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The overall Gross Profit Rate changes reflect the combined performance of the U.S. and International segments. In 2024, both segments improved, with U.S. gains being more pronounced. In 2023, both segments experienced declines, with International's margin compression amplifying the overall negative trend."

      "question": "How did the changes in gross profit rate for Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments in fiscal 2023 contribute to the overall decrease in gross profit rate for Walmart's total operations?",
      "answer": "The overall gross profit rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit rate from the Walmart U.S. segment, which was impacted by markdowns and merchandise mix shifts, and from the Walmart International segment, which experienced margin compression due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts. Specifically, the Walmart International segment's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, contributing significantly to the overall decline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The overall gross profit rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S. and higher supply chain costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The Walmart International segment's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both the Walmart U.S. and International segments contributed to the overall decline in gross profit rate. While the exact basis point contribution from the U.S. segment is not explicitly stated, the overall 98 basis point decline in total gross profit rate is explained by the 50 basis point decline in International and the remaining impact from the U.S. segment."

Separately, the supplemental tax surcharge on HTUs in Germany negatively impacts net revenues and increases accrued liabilities. If the surcharge ruling is unfavorable, it will negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities, compounding the drag from the HTU mix on operating performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The unfavorable HTU mix reduces the overall operating income growth despite volume gains, while the unresolved tax surcharge creates a liability that could further reduce future cash flows, creating dual financial pressures on both income and liquidity."

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two pieces of evidence to explain that the $100 million increase in net interest expense is influenced not only by debt and rate changes but also by derivative activity, which is accounted for within the same financial metric."

      "answer": "In 2023, net operating revenues accounted for 30% of the performance criteria in performance-based share unit awards. This significant weighting means that executive compensation is partially tied to the company's ability to maintain or grow net operating revenues. However, the 10-K filing highlights several risks that could reduce net operating revenues, such as regulatory changes (e.g., restrictions on plastic materials, water usage, and carbon emissions), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (e.g., a strong U.S. dollar affecting international revenue), and legal or compliance failures. These risks could make it more difficult for executives to meet performance targets tied to net operating revenues, potentially reducing the number of performance share units earned. This dynamic could incentivize executives to focus on mitigating these risks or, conversely, to take on more strategic risk to offset potential revenue declines and achieve the performance goals tied to their compensation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Performance share unit awards in 2023 are weighted 30% for net operating revenues, making it a key performance metric for executive compensation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Multiple risks are identified that could reduce net operating revenues, including regulatory changes, foreign exchange fluctuations, and compliance issues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since executive compensation is partially dependent on net operating revenues, and multiple risks could reduce those revenues, there is a direct interaction between executive incentives and exposure to these risks. This creates a potential influence on executive decision-making related to risk management or strategic initiatives."

      "answer": "Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially affect Coca-Cola's financial results, especially with $29.2 billion of net operating revenues derived from operations outside the United States. A strengthening U.S. dollar against major currencies or those of large developing countries could reduce the value of these foreign-denominated revenues when translated into U.S. dollars. Additionally, if Coca-Cola or its bottling partners are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, labor costs could increase, which could affect profit margins. Strikes or labor unrest could also impair the supply of concentrates and syrups, reducing net operating revenues. Together, these factors could lead to both direct revenue reductions from currency translation and indirect reductions from operational disruptions and increased costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Labor cost risks and potential strikes could reduce net operating revenues due to supply chain disruptions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - In 2023, $29.2 billion of net operating revenues came from outside the U.S., making the company vulnerable to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of foreign revenues, while labor disruptions could reduce supply and therefore revenues. Combined, these factors could significantly impact net operating revenues."

      "answer": "Coca-Cola derived $29.2 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States in 2023. To mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting these revenues, the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes. While the exact impact of these derivatives is not quantified in the filing, their purpose is to offset potential losses from currency volatility, particularly from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or those of large developing countries.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The document provides a breakdown of Coca-Cola's net operating revenues, with $29.2 billion coming from international operations in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The filing discusses foreign currency exchange rate risks, noting that fluctuations can materially affect financial results and that the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce this exposure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The question connects the specific revenue figure from international operations with the company's stated strategy of using derivatives to mitigate FX risk, requiring both pieces of information to fully answer."

      "question": "What was the financial impact of Procter & Gamble's Gillette intangible asset impairment for FY2024, and how did net sales growth rate assumptions factor into this evaluation?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) in FY2024 to reduce the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value of $12.8 billion. This impairment was driven by a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and the impact of a new restructuring program. The evaluation of net sales growth rates\u2014both short-term and residual\u2014was a key component in determining the fair value of the Gillette brand. Adverse changes in macroeconomic factors, grooming habits, currency exchange rates, and competitive pressures could negatively impact these growth rates, which in turn would reduce the estimated fair value of the intangible asset and potentially trigger future impairments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract the impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) and the updated carrying value of $12.8 billion for the Gillette intangible asset as of June 30, 2024.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify that the impairment was due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluations, and restructuring impacts.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, extract that net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates) were among the most significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Gillette intangible asset.",
        "Step 4: From evidence_source_a, extract that auditors evaluated the reasonableness of net sales and earnings forecasts by comparing them to historical results, business strategies, internal communications, and analyst reports.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize: The impairment charge was directly tied to assumptions about future net sales growth rates, which were independently evaluated by auditors as part of their testing of management's forecasts."

          "chunk_text": "concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\n\n## We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, regulations or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign exchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revision by individual taxing jurisdictions which may result from multilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. A second pillar would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15 percent. It is possible that the adoption of these or other proposals could have a material impact on our net income and cash flows. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.\n\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court ('Tax Court') issued an opinion ('Opinion') predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company's favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the",

Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.\n\n## Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nOur trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading 'Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks' in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with various laws and regulations, such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations, antitrust and competition laws, anti-modern slavery laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, data privacy laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws and regulations and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws could result in litigation, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $25.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in others over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\n\n## If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\n\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates.

      "question": "How did the performance of Coca-Cola's Bottling Investments segment in 2021, particularly in terms of price and mix, interact with the broader recovery in away-from-home consumption channels to influence the company's net operating revenues?",
      "answer": "The Bottling Investments segment experienced favorable price, category, and package mix in 2021, which contributed positively to net operating revenues. This improvement was driven by the broader recovery in away-from-home consumption channels, such as retail and foodservice locations, which had been negatively impacted in 2020 due to shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements. As a result, the favorable channel and package mix across operating segments, including Bottling Investments, helped increase consolidated net operating revenues. The recovery in these channels allowed the Coca-Cola system to sell 31.3 billion unit cases in 2021, up from 29.0 billion in 2020, further supporting revenue growth.",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited ('Costa'). These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment.\n\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading 'Our Business - General' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners ('Coca-Cola system'), refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Beverage Volume' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\n\n- sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes,  Sprite and Thums Up; 1\n- hydration, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, do\u011fadan, Dasani, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glac\u00e9au smartwater, glac\u00e9au vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and\n- nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.\n\nSchweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States. 1\n\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic partnerships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation ('Monster'), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\n\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\n\n## Distribution System\n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of 2.1 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 31.3 billion and 29.0 billion unit cases of our products in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. In 2021, unit case volume in the United States",

      "answer": "The 82 basis point decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the Sam's Club segment in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by two key factors: higher sales volume and a $0.2 billion reduction in incremental COVID-19 related costs. The increased sales volume allowed operating expenses to be spread over a larger revenue base, improving efficiency and reducing the percentage of expenses relative to sales. Additionally, the $0.2 billion reduction in pandemic-related expenses\u2014such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices, and personal protective equipment\u2014further contributed to the decline. These factors collectively led to the 82 basis point improvement in operating expense efficiency despite the partial offset from reduced tobacco sales.",

V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.

To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use  forward  contracts  and  currency  swaps  with  maturities  of less than 18 months.\n\nBased on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change  in  currency  rates  would  not  materially  affect  our financial statements.\n\nCommodity  Price  Exposure  on  Financial  Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather,  supply  conditions,  political  and  economic  variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and  swap  contracts  to  manage  the  volatility  related  to  the above exposures.\n\nAs of and during the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021,  we  did  not  have  any  financial  commodity  hedging activity.\n\n## Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAP\n\nIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding nonrecurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating  decisions,  allocating  financial  resources  and  for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors  as  they  provide  supplemental  information  about business  performance  and  provide  investors  a  view  of  our business  results  through  the  eyes  of  management.  These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These nonGAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP  measures,  but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These nonGAAP  measures  may  not  be  the  same  as  similar  measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and  in  the  items  or  events  being  adjusted.  These  measures include:\n\nOrganic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a  supplemental  understanding  of  underlying  sales  trends  by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\n\nThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:\n\n",

Core EPS  is  also  used  in  assessing  the  achievement  of  management  goals  for  at-risk  compensation.  The  table  below  provides  a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:\n\n- Charges for early debt extinguishment: During fiscal year 2021 the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.\n\nWe do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.

      "answer": "The decrease in RedCard Penetration from 19.8% in 2022 to 18.6% in 2023 suggests a decline in the proportion of purchases made using RedCards, which Target's internal analysis indicates correlates with incremental sales. Since RedCard users contribute to additional sales for Target, this decline could have negatively impacted sales volume. However, the gross margin rate increased from 23.6% to 26.5%, which was primarily driven by factors such as lower freight costs, reduced promotional markdowns, and improved inventory management, offsetting any potential negative impact from lower RedCard usage.",

      "answer": "The 'Interest and other expense, net' decreased from $423 million in 2022 to $310 million in 2023, a reduction of $113 million. Since Mondel\u0113z International excludes this metric from segment operating income to provide better transparency into segment results, the decrease in this expense improves overall net financial performance but is not reflected in the segment-level profitability analysis. This means that while the company's consolidated financial statements show improved results due to lower interest and other net expenses, the segment reporting remains focused purely on operational performance without the influence of centrally managed financial costs.",

      "question": "How does Mondel\u0113z International's treatment of interest and other expense, net in segment reporting relate to the $2 million and $18 million hedging impacts disclosed for intercompany loans and forecasted interest payments in 2023?",
      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International centrally manages benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net, which are excluded from segment operating income. This aligns with the $2 million and $18 million hedging impacts related to intercompany loans and forecasted interest payments in 2023, as these items are not included in segment profitability measures to provide better transparency of operational performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The hedging impacts of $2 million and $18 million are associated with intercompany loans and forecasted interest payments in 2023, and are recognized in 'Interest and other expense, net'.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Mondel\u0113z excludes interest and other expense, net from segment operating income because these items are centrally managed and not part of segment profitability measures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The exclusion of interest and other expense, net from segment reporting directly relates to the hedging impacts disclosed, explaining why these $20 million total impacts (from $2M + $18M) are not reflected in segment results."

      "answer": "From 2021 to 2023, 'Interest and other expense, net' decreased from $447 million to $310 million, resulting in a $137 million net reduction in expenses.

While the reduction in interest expense contributed to this growth, the central management of this metric, as stated in the Segment Reporting note, reflects its exclusion from regional operating income evaluations.

      "answer": "The total change in TGT's Nonqualified Plans Net Expense from 2019 ($27 million) to 2021 ($32 million) was an increase of $5 million. Over the same period, the benefits expense decreased from $80 million in 2019 to $59 million in 2021, while the related investment (income)/expense improved from a cost of $53 million in 2019 to a lower cost of $27 million in 2021.

At September 1, 2024, Costco operated  890 warehouses worldwide: 614 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 108 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 35 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in T aiwan, sev en in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Z ealand, and Sweden. T he Company operates ecommerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company's equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries hav e been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.\n\n## Fiscal Year End\n\nThe Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024 and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of rev enues and expenses during the reporting period. T hese estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nReclassifications were made to the 2023 and 2022 consolidated statements of cash flows to conform with current year presentation.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid inv estments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receiv ables were $2,519 and $2,282 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Short-Term Investments\n\nShort-term inv estments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. gov ernment and agency securities), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to fiv e years.

Cash and cash equiv alents and short-term inv estments were $11,144 and $15,234 at September 1, 2024, and September 3, 2023. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receiv ables  represented  approximately  $2,519  and  $2,282.  T hese  receiv ables  generally  settle  within  four  days.  Changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates impacted cash and cash equiv alents positiv ely by $40 and $15 in 2024 and 2023, and negativ ely by $249 in 2022.\n\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on September 1, 2024, related to debt and leases.\n\nPurchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party serv ices, the majority of which are due in the next 12  months.  Construction  and  land-purchase  obligations  consist  of  contracts  primarily  related  to  the  dev elopment  and  opening  of  new  and  relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.\n\nWe believe that our cash and inv estment position and operating cash flow , with capacity under existing and av ailable credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash prov ided by operating activ ities totaled $1 1,339 in 2024, compared to $1 1,068 in 2023. Our cash flow prov ided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including wages and employee benefits, utilities, credit and debit card processing fees, and operating leases. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net inv estment in merchandise inv entories (the difference between merchandise inv entories and accounts payable) is impacted by sev eral factors, including inv entory lev els and turnov er, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in inv esting activ ities totaled $4,409 in 2024, compared to $4,972 in 2023, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from inv esting activ ities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term inv estments.\n\n## Capital Expenditure Plans\n\nOur  primary  requirements  for  capital  are  acquiring  land,  buildings,  and  equipment  for  new  and  remodeled  warehouses,  information  systems  and manufacturing  and  distribution  facilities. In  2024,  we  spent  $4,710  on  capital  expenditures,  and  it  is  our  current  intention  to  spend  a  similar  amount during fiscal 2025. T hese expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, cash and cash equiv alents, and short-term inv estments.

      "question": "How does the potential impairment risk of PBNA's franchise rights in 2023 compare to the 2022 impairment charges for PepsiCo's Europe division, and what does this indicate about the relative financial pressures on these segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PepsiCo recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.6 billion related to the SodaStream brand in its Europe division due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and underperformance. In contrast, as of December 30, 2023, the estimated fair values of PBNA's indefinite-lived franchise rights exceeded their carrying values, indicating no immediate impairment. However, the 2023 note highlights that PBNA could face impairment if future sales and operating profits fall short of expectations or if macroeconomic conditions worsen. This comparison shows that while Europe faced significant impairment in 2022, PBNA was still above impairment thresholds in 2023 but remained at risk under similar financial stress.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PepsiCo recognized a $1.6 billion pre-tax impairment charge in 2022 for the SodaStream brand in the Europe division due to macroeconomic pressures and performance issues.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - As of December 30, 2023, PBNA\u2019s franchise rights had fair values exceeding carrying values, but the company noted potential future impairment if performance or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the 2022 impairment in Europe to the 2023 risk in PBNA reveals that while Europe already experienced significant financial pressure leading to impairment, PBNA remained resilient in 2023 but was still vulnerable under similar stress conditions."

      "answer": "TGT's Deferred Occupancy Income decreased from $118 million in FY2023 to $109 million in FY2024, a reduction of $9 million. During the same period, TGT's total gross deferred tax assets increased from $2,506 million to $2,649 million, representing a net increase of $143 million. This indicates that while Deferred Occupancy Income declined, other components of deferred tax assets grew significantly enough to drive an overall increase in total gross deferred tax assets by 5.7%. The reduction in Deferred Occupancy Income likely reflects a decrease in prepaid rent or occupancy-related deferrals, which may signal changes in lease terms or occupancy strategies.",

These commodity derivatives include agricultural  products,  energy  and  metals.  Commodity  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting treatment  are  marked  to  market  each  period  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying  commodity.  These  gains  and  losses  are  subsequently  reflected  in  division  results  when  the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the  economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\n## 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\n\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business  models  to  further  simplify,  harmonize  and  automate  processes;  re-engineer  our  go-to-market  and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019  Productivity  Plan  to  date,  we  expanded  and  extended  the  program  through  the  end  of  2026  to  take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $3.15  billion,  including  cash  expenditures  of  approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results,  we  expect  to  incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $350  million,  including  cash  expenditures  of approximately $300 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.\n\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan.  We  regularly  evaluate  productivity  initiatives  beyond  the  productivity  plan  and  other  initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included  in  the  acquisition-date  balance  sheets,  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa,  closing  costs,  employee-related  costs,  gains  associated  with  contingent  consideration,  contract termination costs and other integration costs.\n\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact\n\nPension  and  retiree  medical-related  impact  primarily  includes  settlement  charges  related  to  lump  sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.",

      "answer": "The projected decrease in the medical cost trend rate from 6.00% in 2024 to 4.50% by 2028 indicates a declining assumption in the rate of increase of healthcare costs for retirees, which would reduce the company's expected future benefit obligations. According to the evidence, a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would impact future Net Income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $2. Therefore, a decrease of 1.5 percentage points (from 6.00% to 4.50%) would result in a positive impact of approximately $3 on net income. This sensitivity analysis reveals that the company's financial performance is directly influenced by changes in benefit cost assumptions, particularly for other postretirement benefits.",

      "answer": "The exclusion of the $47 million gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific in 2022 contributed to a lower operating profit margin for that year. When this item is excluded, as it is for comparable analysis, the operating profit margin for 2022 increases slightly, making the year-over-year margin improvement smaller than the reported 440 basis points. Specifically, the adjusted operating profit margin in 2023 was 20.7%, only 20 basis points higher than the adjusted 2022 margin of 20.5%, showing that the gain had a positive distortion in 2022 that inflated the unadjusted margin comparison.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, identify that the operating profit margin in 2023 was 20.5% (unadjusted) and 20.7% (adjusted), while in 2022 it was 16.1% (unadjusted) and 20.5% (adjusted). This shows a 440 basis point increase in unadjusted margin and only a 20 basis point increase in adjusted margin.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, identify that the gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific in 2022 was $47 million and that it was a one-time item excluded in the adjusted figures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that the $47 million gain positively impacted the 2022 operating profit, but was excluded for comparability, leading to a higher adjusted 2022 margin. This means that the actual improvement in operating margin from 2022 to 2023 was only 20 basis points, not the 440 basis points shown in unadjusted figures."

This trend indicates that a growing number of restricted stock units were excluded from diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations during this period because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

      "question": "Given Coca-Cola's discretionary marketing support to bottlers and the potential impact of legal and regulatory risks, how might these factors collectively affect the company's net operating revenues from international markets, particularly in light of the $28.7 billion earned outside the U.S. in 2024?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's discretionary marketing support to bottlers can help increase unit case volume and net operating revenues, particularly in underperforming markets where the company intervenes to improve performance. However, legal and regulatory risks\u2014such as evolving interpretations of laws related to product safety, environmental regulations, and data privacy\u2014could increase compliance costs or limit the production and sale of products, directly affecting profitability. Additionally, $28.7 billion of net operating revenues in 2024 came from international markets, which are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A strengthening U.S. dollar could materially affect financial results, compounding the impact of legal and regulatory risks. Thus, while marketing support can enhance revenues, legal and regulatory challenges\u2014combined with foreign exchange volatility\u2014pose measurable threats to the $28.7 billion earned internationally.",

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, extended producer responsibility, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices (including human rights), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence), personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital ex penditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, extended producer responsibility, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices (including human rights), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence), personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital ex penditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

      "question": "What percentage of Coca-Cola's consolidated net operating revenues in 2024 came from operations outside the United States, and how might this exposure influence financial performance given the company's stated risks related to foreign currency exchange rates?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola derived $28.7 billion of its $47,061 million consolidated net operating revenues in 2024 from operations outside the United States, representing approximately 61% of total revenues. The company explicitly states that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could materially affect its financial results. Given this significant international exposure, currency volatility could lead to adverse impacts on reported revenues and operating income during periods of dollar strength, despite the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate some of this risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Total consolidated net operating revenues for 2024 were $47,061 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Coca-Cola derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Calculate proportion - $28.7 billion (international revenue) \u00f7 $47.061 billion (total revenue) = approximately 61%.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - The company explicitly states that strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could materially affect its financial results.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The 61% international revenue exposure combined with Coca-Cola's own risk disclosure indicates that foreign exchange rate fluctuations could significantly impact financial performance, particularly through revenue translation effects."

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, extended producer responsibility, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices (including human rights), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence), personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital ex penditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

      "answer": "Altria recognized a $537 million tax benefit from its investment in JUUL in 2021, indicating a significant financial relationship with the e-vapor company. However, regulatory pressures in major U.S. markets like California and New York, which have enacted or proposed bans on flavored tobacco products (including e-vapor products), could restrict JUUL's market access and product offerings. California\u2019s flavor ban, which includes menthol, mint, and wintergreen, and New York\u2019s legislation, which restricts flavored tobacco products unless they have received FDA market authorization, could reduce JUUL\u2019s sales volume and market share in these large, influential markets. This could negatively affect JUUL's performance and, by extension, the value of Altria\u2019s investment. A decline in JUUL\u2019s value could reduce or eliminate future tax benefits Altria expects to receive from this investment, thereby increasing its effective tax rate and negatively impacting its financial position.",

        "Step 4: A reduction in the value of Altria\u2019s investment in JUUL could result in diminished future tax benefits, which would increase Altria\u2019s effective tax rate and harm its financial position."

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

      "answer": "The combined effects of litigation risks and the growth of alternative tobacco products significantly challenge Altria's ability to maintain cigarette consumption levels and achieve its long-term business vision. Litigation risks, such as the potential for unfavorable court outcomes and non-monetary remedies like corrective statements or import bans (e.g., the ITC ban on IQOS devices and Marlboro HeatSticks), could materially impact Altria's financial position and restrict product availability. Simultaneously, the growth of e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches, as well as unregulated synthetic nicotine products, has already contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and sales volume. These competitive pressures, combined with the uncertainty surrounding litigation outcomes and the evolving regulatory landscape, create a challenging environment for Altria to sustain its traditional tobacco business and achieve its Vision.",

The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.\n\nIn certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.\n\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed in Note 18, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. Although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\n\nIn certain litigation, Altria, its subsidiaries and its investees may face potentially significant non-monetary remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. For example, in the Federal Government's lawsuit discussed in Note 18, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of 'corrective statements.' In the patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC discussed in Note 18, the ITC banned the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and component parts into the United States and the sale and marketing of any such products previously imported into the United States. As a result of the ITC's decision, PM USA removed the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and any infringing components from the marketplace.\n\nIn 2019, we determined that our investment in JUUL was impaired in part due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against JUUL. Altria and PM USA are also defendants in many of these cases. In addition, in April 2020 the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that Altria's 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute unreasonable restraint on trade. In February 2022, the administrative law judge dismissed the FTC's complaint. FTC complaint counsel appealed that decision to the FTC Commissioners. E-vapor litigation and the FTC action, including the remedies the FTC is seeking, are further discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K ('Item 3') and Note 18.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain.\n\nIt is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees, could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in certain pending litigation could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so. See Item 3, Note 18 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 10-K for a discussion of pending tobacco-related litigation.\n\nSignificant federal, state and local governmental actions, including actions by the FDA, and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on Altria and its tobacco operating companies' or its investees' businesses and sales volumes and on Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nAs described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, PM USA faces significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold PM USA responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. These actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels.\n\nMore broadly, actions by the FDA and other federal, state or local governments or agencies, including those specific actions described in Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7, may (i) impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products (for example, through nicotine or constituent limits or menthol or other flavor bans), (ii) delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk, (iii) limit adult tobacco consumer choices, (iv) require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace (for example as a result of (a) product contamination, (b) legislation and rulemaking that bans menthol or other flavors, (c) a determination by the FDA that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence, (d) because the FDA requires that a currently marketed tobacco product proceed",

In addition, our subsidiaries and investees may incur increased costs and otherwise be negatively affected if significant portions of their respective workforces (or the workforces within their respective distribution or supply chains) are unable to work or work effectively, including because of illness, unavailability of personal protective equipment, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak (including new variants), increases in the number of cases in future periods, and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health effects. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our or our investees' future financial or operational results, but the impact could be material over time. See the risks below related to extended disruptions at a facility, of a distributor or in service by a service provider and the risks related to our investments in JUUL, ABI and Cronos and the earnings from and carrying value of those investments. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our tobacco operating companies and investees, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic in Item 7.\n\nAltria's tobacco businesses face significant competition (including across categories) and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria, or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and on Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nEach of Altria's tobacco operating companies operates in highly competitive tobacco categories. This competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve. Significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities. This highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability, market share (including as a result of down-trading to lower-priced competitive brands) and shipment volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria. See Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Summary in Item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences. Growth of the e-vapor product category and other innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and in the consumption levels and sales volumes of other tobacco products, including MST. In addition, growth of unregulated synthetic nicotine products, which may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions (including marketing restrictions and FDA pre-marketing requirements) as the tobacco-derived e-vapor and oral nicotine products of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL, could negatively impact the growth of e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products. Continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies if they are unable to compete effectively (directly or through Altria's investments) in these innovative product categories, which could also negatively impact Altria's ability to achieve its Vision.\n\nPM USA also faces competition from lower-priced brands sold by certain United States and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the United States and, as such, are not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements. These settlement payments are significant for PM USA, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation in Item 7. These settlements, among other factors, resulted in substantial cigarette price increases to help cover the cost of the settlement payments. Manufacturers not party to the settlements are subject to state escrow legislation requiring escrow deposits. Such manufacturers may avoid these escrow obligations by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers' cigarettes sold in such states. Additional competition has resulted from diversion into the United States market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the United States, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes, and imports of foreign lower-priced brands.\n\nAltria and its tobacco operating companies may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Altria or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies.\n\nEach of our tobacco operating companies is subject to intense competition and changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences. To be successful, they must continue to:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences;\n- develop, manufacture, market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers (including, where appropriate, through arrangements with, or investments in, third parties);\n- improve productivity; and\n- protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases.",

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance. We hav e detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below . The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and div estiture activ ities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activ ities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activ ities and other major items affecting comparability of operating  results.  We  believ e  the  nonGAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures.

For additional information, see Item  1A, Risk Factors ,  including the risk entitled ' The war in Ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations. '\n\n## Developments in the Middle East\n\nIn  October 2023, conflict dev eloped in the  Middle  East between  Hamas and  Israel, and has expanded to other parts of the region.  During 2024, we experienced  sales  impacts  related  to  this  conflict  in  certain  AMEA  markets,  but  this  did  not  hav e  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of operations or financial condition. We continue to ev aluate the impacts of these dev elopments on our business and we cannot predict if it will hav e a significant impact in the future.\n\n## ERP System Implementation\n\nIn  July  2024, our  Board of  Directors approv ed funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply  chain  systems  (the  'ERP  System  Implementation').  The  ERP  System  Implementation  spending  comprises  both  capital  expenditures  and operating  expenses,  of  which  a  majority  is  expected  to  relate  to  operating  expenses.  T he  operating  expenses  associated  with  the  ERP  System Implementation  represent  incremental  transformational  costs  abov e  the  normal  ongoing  lev el  of  spending  on  information  technology  to  support operations. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented by region in sev eral phases with spending occurring ov er the next fiv e years, with  expected  completion  by  year-end  2028.  Refer  to Non-GAAP  financial  measures and  Note  1, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies for additional information.\n\n## Extreme Price Growth in Argentina\n\nDuring December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly dev alued. The peso's dev aluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases  in  excess  of  26%  year-ov er-year  (\"extreme  pricing\")  in  Argentina,  from  these  measures  beginning  in  Q1  2024.  T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&amp;A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information.\n\nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\n- Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfav orable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp).  In  Emerging  Markets, unfav orable currencyrelated items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp). In Dev eloped Markets, fav orable currency-related items of $68 million (0.3 pp) were driv en by fav orable currency translation rate changes.\n- Adjusted Operating Income: Unfav orable currency-related items of $191 million were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $460 million, partially offset by extreme pricing of $269 million.\n- Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.12 were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $0.32, partially offset by extreme pricing of $0.20.",

      "answer": "The total impact of the initial tax law changes on MDLZ's financial performance from 2022 to 2024 was a cumulative expense of $124 million ($17 million in 2022, $83 million in 2023, and $24 million in 2024).

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The table shows the line item 'Initial impacts from enacted tax law changes' with values of $24 million (2024), $83 million (2023), and $17 million (2022), totaling $124 million over the three years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The note explains that MDLZ excludes 'initial impacts from enacted tax law changes' from its non-GAAP financial measures because these do not reflect ongoing tax obligations and excluding them improves comparability of performance across periods.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $124 million cumulative expense from tax law changes is significant in specific years (e.g., $83 million in 2023), which supports the company's rationale for excluding these non-recurring impacts to better reflect ongoing operations in non-GAAP reporting."

See  N ote  1 1, Benefit  Plans ,  for  additional  inform ation  on  the multiem ployer pension plan withdrawal.\n- (16) I n  J uly 2024, our B oard of D irectors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a m ulti-year system s transform ation program  to upgrade our global E R P  and supply chain system s (the 'E R P  S ystem  I m plem entation'), which is com prised of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a m ajority is expected to be operating expenses. The E R P  System  I m plem entation program  will be im plem ented in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected com pletion by year-end 2028. The operating expenses associated with the E R P  System  Im plem entation represent increm ental transform ational costs above the norm al ongoing level of spending on inform ation technology to support operations. T hese expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program , accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP  financial system s and various other expenses, all associated with the im plem entation of our inform ation technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from  our non-GAAP  financial m easures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\n(17) I n  the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude m ark-to-m arket unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our m arketable securities from  our non-G AAP  earnings m easures. T hese m arketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\n(18) We have excluded the initial im pacts from  enacted tax law changes. I nitial im pacts include item s such as the rem easurem ent of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from  the 2017 U .S. tax reform . W e exclude initial im pacts from  enacted tax law changes from  our Adjusted E P S as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law.\n\n(19) We exclude gains and losses on equity m ethod transactions including im pairm ents of our equity m ethod investm ents. I n addition, we also exclude from  our non-G AAP financial m easures any gains or losses realized on econom ic hedges on sales proceeds from  our equity m ethod investm ent transactions, which have been recorded in Interest and other expense, net . T hese item s are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding  U.S.  GAAP financial measures, prov ides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures v ary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that hav e an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by ev aluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully ev aluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K, which can be found abov e under Consolidated Results of Operations .",

These existing and potential future laws and regulations could increase the costs of, and impair our ability to, source certain materials used in the packaging for our products.\n\nIf we are unable to compensate for supply shortages or elevated commodity and other costs through sustained price increases, cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, the limited use of commodity hedging contracts or through other initiatives, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\n\nOur operating companies rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers, and an extended disruption at a facility or in serv ice by a supplier, distributor or distribution chain serv ice prov ider could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nOur operating companies face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers. A natural or man-made disaster, cybersecurity incident, global pandemic, labor disruption or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of our operating companies, the operations of any key supplier, distributor or distribution chain service provider of any of our operating companies or any other disruption in the supply or distribution of goods or services (including a key supplier's inability to comply with government regulations, lack of available workers or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company) could adversely impact operations. Operations of our operating companies, suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times, or halted permanently, depending on various factors. An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of our operating companies or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers, distributors or distribution chain service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## We may be required to write down goodwill and intangible assets, including trademarks and intellectual property, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general macroeconomic conditions, the proliferation of illicit products, government actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction, changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity, unfavorable outcomes with respect to litigation proceedings, including actions brought against us alleging patent infringement, and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets.\n\nFor example, we recorded an impairment on the value of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024. The impairment was the result of the decrease in the fair value of the Skoal trademark caused by decreases in the size of the MST products category, which were due, in part, to the growth of nicotine pouch volumes. We continue to monitor several factors that impact the fair value of the Skoa l trademark. For ex ample, if Skoal's actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly different from forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, we could have an additional non-cash impairment on the carrying value of the Skoal trademark in future periods.\n\nWe monitor several factors that could impact the carrying value of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill and related definite-lived intangible assets. Increasing sales of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the lack of meaningful enforcement against these products have negatively impacted the volume growth of NJOY's pod-based e-vapor products. Additionally, in January 2025, in a patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC imposed bans on the importation of NJOY ACE into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE products previously imported into the United States. If the bans on the importation into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE become effective or continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly unfavorable longterm outlook for NJOY's volume growth rates versus our projections used to estimate the fair value, either development could result in a non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets, or both, in future periods.\n\nIf any impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nOur Optimize &amp; Accelerate initiativ e may expose us to increased risks relating to business continuity and our internal control over financial reporting and audit procedures, among others, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn October 2024, we announced the multi-phase Initiative, through which we plan to increase our organization's speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.\n\nThe Initiative presents a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, such as risks relating to operational continuity, talent management and internal control over financial reporting and audit procedures. For example, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and inefficiency during transitional periods. Furthermore, many of the tasks that will be outsourced will be performed in developing countries that may be at a heightened risk for geopolitical uncertainty, which could result in service",

      "answer": "The combined operating income from the European Union and Eastern Europe increased from $4,517 million in 2019 ($3,970M + $547M) to $6,990 million in 2021 ($6,119M + $1,213M), representing a total growth of $2,473 million or approximately 54.8%. During the same period, the company's total operating income grew from $10,531 million to $12,975 million, an increase of $2,444 million. This means that the growth from just these two regions alone accounted for nearly the entire $2,444 million increase in total operating income company-wide.

      "answer": "In 2020, MDLZ received higher benefits from the resolution of a tax matter, which partially offset a $152 million decrease in segment operating income. In 2021, however, the company experienced lower benefits from tax matter resolutions, which partially offset a $72 million increase in segment operating income. As a result, the reduction in tax resolution benefits from 2020 to 2021 contributed to the contrast between the two years' operating income performance, even though the overall direction of change in operating income shifted from negative to positive.",

      "answer": "The Simplify to Grow Program contributed to a $72 million increase in segment operating income in 2021 and helped offset some declines in 2020, where lower costs for the program were a partial counter to otherwise negative financial drivers. In 2021, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program were among the favorable factors contributing to the $72 million (38.1%) increase in segment operating income. In 2020, although segment operating income decreased by $152 million (44.6%), lower costs incurred for the same program were noted as one of the few favorable items that partially offset the decline. Therefore, the combined effect of the program's cost reductions across both years served to reduce the overall decline in operating income between 2020 and 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

In Latin America, the same cost increase partially offset the gains from higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, resulting in a $72 million (38.1%) increase in segment operating income.

The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.\n\nSegment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020.

Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable volume/mix reflected strong volume growth as the negative impacts from the pandemic that we experienced in the prior year subsided across the region. Favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by declines in refreshment beverages and cheese &amp; grocery.
