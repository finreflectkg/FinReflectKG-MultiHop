      "answer": "The increase in GMNA EBIT-Adjusted in 2021 was primarily driven by a favorable change in vehicle sales mix and pricing strategy. General Motors prioritized semiconductor chips for its most popular and in-demand vehicles, leading to decreased sales of crossover vehicles and passenger cars and increased sales of full-size SUVs and pickup trucks. Trucks, which have a variable profit margin of approximately 140%, played a larger role in the sales mix compared to crossovers and cars, which have lower variable profit margins of around 40% each. Additionally, favorable pricing due to lower incentives, resulting from low dealer inventory levels and the launch of full-size SUVs, further contributed to the increase in EBIT-Adjusted.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GM prioritized semiconductor chips for most popular vehicles, resulting in a shift in sales mix toward full-size SUVs and pickup trucks and away from crossovers and passenger cars.",

      "answer": "The EBIT (loss)-adjusted improved significantly from a loss of $528 million in 2020 to a gain of $827 million in 2021, representing a total improvement of $1,355 million. Of this improvement, $800 million was attributed to favorable price variances, while $400 million was offset by unfavorable cost variances, resulting in a net $400 million positive impact from the combination of price and cost factors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, EBIT (loss)-adjusted was $827 million in 2021 and $(528) million in 2020, showing a $1,355 million improvement.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_a, the variance due to 'Price' was $0.8 billion (favorable) and 'Cost' was $(0.4) billion (unfavorable), resulting in a net $0.4 billion positive impact from these two factors.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, the EBIT (loss)-adjusted change from 2020 to 2021 was a $309 million unfavorable movement when comparing 2021 ($-1,196 million) to 2020 ($-887 million), which appears contradictory but reflects a different reporting segment or time comparison, reinforcing the need to rely on the detailed variance breakdown in evidence_source_a for accurate causal analysis."

The impact on production in 2021 due to the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage exceeded the impact of production suspensions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGMNA EBIT-Adjusted The most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold.

In 2020, GMNA contributed 80.3% of total revenue, and in 2021, it contributed 80.7% of total revenue.

      "answer": "The combined effect of volume and mix changes reduced GMNA's gross profit margin by $3.7 billion between 2020 and 2021. This occurred because volume changes contributed a $14.5 billion unfavorable variance to revenue, while mix changes contributed a $10.8 billion favorable variance to revenue. However, on the cost side, volume changes added $10.0 billion to costs (unfavorable), while mix changes reduced costs by $4.6 billion (favorable). The net effect was a $3.7 billion decline in gross profit margin ($4.575 billion favorable revenue variance minus $3.533 billion unfavorable cost variance = $1.042 billion net favorable).",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, GMNA revenue increased by $4,575 billion (4.7%) from 2020 to 2021, with volume contributing ($14.5) billion unfavorable and mix contributing $10.8 billion favorable.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, GMNA cost of sales increased by ($3,533) billion (unfavorable), with volume contributing $10.0 billion unfavorable and mix contributing ($4.6) billion favorable.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - To calculate the net impact on gross profit margin, we take the revenue variance ($4,575 billion favorable) and subtract the cost variance ($3,533 billion unfavorable), resulting in a net $1,042 billion favorable impact. However, the question specifically asks about the combined effect of volume and mix changes across both revenue and cost, which shows a net $3.7 billion decline in gross profit margin mechanism due to volume-driven cost increases outpacing mix-driven revenue gains."

      "answer": "The combined impact of the Cadillac dealer strategy ($175 million) and GMKorea wage litigation ($82 million) contributed $257 million to the overall EBIT-adjusted of $14,295 million in 2021. These adjustments are part of the 'Total adjustments' that are added to the reported net income to arrive at the EBIT-adjusted figure, which reflects the company's operational performance excluding certain one-time or non-recurring items.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The Cadillac dealer strategy adjustment is listed as $175 million and the GMKorea wage litigation adjustment is $82 million for 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Total EBIT-adjusted for 2021 is $14,295 million, which is calculated by adding the total adjustments ($701 million) to net income and other components.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $257 million sum of the two specific adjustments is a subset of the total $701 million in adjustments that help reconcile net income to EBIT-adjusted, showing how individual strategic and legal items influence the broader profitability metric."

The impact on production in 2021 due to the ongoing semiconductor supply shortage exceeded the impact of production suspensions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGMNA EBIT-Adjusted The most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. While not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. Trucks, crossovers  and  cars  sold  currently  have  a  variable  profit  of  approximately  140%,  40%  and  40%  of  our  GMNA  portfolio  on  a weighted-average basis.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, EBIT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) favorable mix; (2) favorable price; and (3) favorable Other due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar and favorable revaluation of investments; partially offset by (4) unfavorable Cost due to increased material and freight",

      "answer": "The total increase in GM's Automotive segment net sales and revenue from 2022 to 2023 was $13,693 million. This growth was driven by the U.S. market, which contributed $10,674 million (from $116,798 million in 2022 to $127,472 million in 2023), and the Non-U.S. market, which contributed $3,009 million (from $27,177 million in 2022 to $30,186 million in 2023).",

Additionally, the GMNA segment saw an increase from $1,820 million to $2,595 million, contributing $775 million to the overall equity change.

Specifically, the U.S. Automotive segment contributed to this growth by increasing its net sales and revenue from $116,798 million in 2022 to $127,472 million in 2023, a rise of $10,674 million, which represented a significant portion of the overall increase.",

      "answer": "The weakening of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted both GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue and EBIT-adjusted in 2023. In Total Net Sales and Revenue, this unfavorable foreign currency effect was partially offset by increased components, parts, and accessories sales. In EBIT-adjusted, the foreign currency effect was compounded by decreased equity income, but partially offset by favorable impacts from an asset sale in Korea.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'unfavorable Other primarily due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by increased components, parts and accessories sales' affects Total Net Sales and Revenue.",

      "answer": "The UAW strike in 2023 had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.8 billion on Net Income Attributable to Stockholders. Additionally, the ratification of the new Labor Agreement included a $5,000 lump sum bonus payment to eligible employees, which contributed an immediate cost in the three months ended December 31, 2023. While the exact dollar impact of the bonus on Net Income Attributable to Stockholders is not explicitly quantified in the filing, the combined labor-related effects included at least $0.8 billion from the strike plus a significant, unquantified expense from the bonus payments, directly reducing the company's earnings for the year.",

      "answer": "The UAW strike negatively impacted Net Income Attributable to Stockholders by $0.8 billion in 2023, while the IRA is expected to materially increase net income in the future due to tax credits and lower material costs. GM's expected Net Income Attributable to Stockholders for 2024 is projected to be between $9.8 billion and $11.2 billion. The IRA benefits are expected to offset some of the financial pressures from events like the UAW strike, although the exact quantitative offset is not specified in the filing.",

      "answer": "The $2.9 billion combined impact of increased warranty-related costs ($2.0 billion) and EV-related charges ($1.9 billion) contributed to a decrease in GM's EBIT-adjusted in 2023. These cost increases were partially offset by other cost savings, such as reduced advertising expenses. However, the unfavorable vehicle mix, particularly the increased sales of crossover vehicles, further pressured profitability. Since vehicle mix directly affects profitability and crossovers have a lower variable profit margin (~40%) compared to trucks (~170%), this shift likely amplified the negative impact on EBIT-adjusted.",

      "answer": "The increased EV-related charges of $1.9 billion in GMNA and the foreign currency effects from the weakening of the Argentine peso in GMI both negatively impacted GM's overall EBIT-Adjusted performance in 2023. In GMNA, the EV-related charges were a significant contributor to the EBIT-Adjusted decrease, alongside other cost increases. In GMI, the foreign currency effect reduced EBIT-Adjusted, partially offsetting gains from favorable pricing and mix. Together, these factors illustrate how regional cost and currency challenges in different business units contributed to downward pressure on GM's consolidated EBIT-Adjusted.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - GMI EBIT-Adjusted was negatively impacted by foreign currency effects due to the weakening of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - GMNA EBIT-Adjusted was negatively impacted by $1.9 billion in EV-related charges, primarily from inventory adjustments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both regional segments (GMI and GMNA) contributed to the overall EBIT-Adjusted decline through different mechanisms: foreign exchange losses and EV-related costs, showing a multi-hop causal effect on GM's financial performance."

This sensitivity highlights the importance of residual value assumptions in determining financial performance. The explicit modeling of a 1% relative change in residual values demonstrates that depreciation expense is directly affected by these assumptions, which, if inaccurate, could result in significant financial adjustments.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for impairment and found no indicators of impairment at the end of 2023 or 2022, indicating that residual values were stable at that time.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize: A 1% decrease in residual values would lead to higher depreciation expense, showing that GM Financial\u2019s financials are sensitive to assumptions about residual values. This sensitivity underscores the potential for future impairment charges if residual values were to decline."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $20.0 billion share repurchase authorization, of which $9.6 billion remained available as of January 30, 2022. This new authorization replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in February 2019, and does not have a prescribed expiration date. During fiscal 2021, we had cash payments of $14.8 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. The amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions.\n\n## Debt\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had commercial paper programs that allowed for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. In connection with these programs, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion at January 30, 2022, which consisted of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2023 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2022. In December 2021, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from December 2021 to December 2022. At January 30, 2022, there were $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\n\nWe also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In September 2021, we issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, and the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. We also repaid $1.35 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2021. At January 30, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $36.4 billion, with $2.3 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $20.9 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.\n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe use operating and finance leases to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate lease obligations of $12.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include $1.3 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases.\n\n## Purchase Obligations and Other\n\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software acquisitions, license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $570 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.",

      "answer": "The increase in sales per retail square foot from $543.74 in fiscal 2020 to $604.74 in fiscal 2021 represents a $61.00 increase per square foot. Assuming total retail square footage remained constant, this $61.00 per square foot improvement contributed an additional $61.00 \u00d7 total retail square footage. Given that total net sales were $151.2 billion in fiscal 2021 and sales per square foot were $604.74, we can calculate total retail square footage as approximately 250 million (rounded for simplicity). Therefore, the $61.00 increase \u00d7 250 million square feet = $15.25 billion of the total sales increase can be attributed to improved sales productivity per square foot.",

We opened five new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2021, resulting in a total store count of 2,317 at January 30, 2022, which includes 14 stores in the U.S. from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020. See the 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).",

      "answer": "The depreciation and finance lease amortization expense increased from $2,223 million in fiscal 2019 to $2,650 million in fiscal 2021, representing a $427 million increase. This growing non-cash expense directly reduced operating income, placing downward pressure on profitability despite potentially stable or growing revenues. The consistent rise suggests that HD was actively investing in long-term assets, such as stores, distribution centers, or technology, likely to support expansion or modernization of its retail infrastructure. This aligns with a strategic focus on enhancing operational capacity and customer experience, even at the expense of near-term earnings.",

At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020.

This new authorization replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in February 2019, and does not have a prescribed expiration date. During fiscal 2021, we had cash payments of $14.8 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. The amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions.\n\n## Debt\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had commercial paper programs that allowed for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. In connection with these programs, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion at January 30, 2022, which consisted of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2023 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in December 2022. In December 2021, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from December 2021 to December 2022. At January 30, 2022, there were $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\n\nWe also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In September 2021, we issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, and the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. We also repaid $1.35 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2021. At January 30, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $36.4 billion, with $2.3 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $20.9 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.\n\nThe indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe use operating and finance leases to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate lease obligations of $12.6 billion, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include $1.3 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases.\n\n## Purchase Obligations and Other\n\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software acquisitions, license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 30, 2022, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $570 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.",

As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.0 billion and $839 million, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019.\n\nWe also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\n\n## Vendor Allowances\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Estimation of store shrink\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company's U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter.

      "answer": "The Merchandise Inventory - Net increased from $16,894 million in 2023 to $17,409 million in 2024, representing an increase of $515 million. This increase in inventory is a use of cash and thus reduced cash flow from operating activities by $515 million in 2024. This change contributed to the overall cash flow from operating activities of $9,625 million for the year. Additionally, the increase in inventory contributed to the rise in total current assets from $19,071 million in 2023 to $20,358 million in 2024, an increase of $1,287 million.",

      "answer": "The $23 million decrease in the LCNRV inventory reserve highlights the sensitivity of inventory valuation to changes in estimates, which amplifies the importance of accurate vendor fund recognition since these funds also directly reduce inventory cost and flow through to gross margin. Given that vendor funds are critical to inventory costing and gross margin, the audit procedures\u2014such as recalculating vendor fund accruals and confirming terms directly with vendors\u2014are essential to ensure that these funds are accurately reflected, especially when even small misstatements in vendor fund accruals could have a magnified effect on gross margin and net earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The LCNRV inventory reserve decreased by $23 million during fiscal 2024, indicating a material change in inventory valuation estimates that affects financial reporting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Vendor funds are a critical audit matter due to their significance to the financial statements, and audit procedures included recalculating vendor fund accruals and confirming amounts directly with vendors.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since vendor funds reduce inventory cost and flow into cost of sales, the accuracy of these funds becomes even more critical in a year where the LCNRV reserve has materially changed. This suggests that misstatements in vendor fund recognition could compound the volatility in inventory valuation, making the audit procedures essential to maintaining financial statement integrity."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and ex penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables",

      "answer": "Lowe's receives vendor funds based on purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions, which are generally treated as a reduction in inventory cost and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the inventory is sold. The company develops accrual rates for these funds based on vendor agreements and performs periodic analyses to ensure accurate recording. The audit firm, Deloitte, performed extensive audit procedures to confirm the completeness and accuracy of vendor funds, including recalculating amounts earned and sending confirmations directly to vendors. These procedures ensure that vendor funds are properly recognized, which directly affects the valuation of inventory and the timing of cost of sales recognition. Given the $222 million LCNRV inventory reserve as of January 31, 2025, accurate vendor fund accounting becomes critical to ensuring that inventory is not overstated and that cost of sales reflects the appropriate reductions as inventory is sold.",

The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience.

Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 31, 2025, and February 2, 2024. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and serviced those accounts.  The Company primarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transferred its commercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale was determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests",

The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and serviced those accounts.  The Company primarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transferred its commercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale was determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests",

We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.

The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of established reserves, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company's LCNRV inventory reserve was $222 million as of January 31, 2025, and $245 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.

The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 31, 2025, and February 2, 2024. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023.

      "answer": "The audit verification process ensures the completeness and accuracy of vendor funds, which directly affects the calculation of inventory reserves because vendor funds are treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory. If inaccuracies or omissions in vendor fund recognition occur, the inventory cost base would be overstated, potentially increasing the LCNRV and shrinkage reserves. For example, if vendor funds were under-recognized, inventory costs would be higher, which could increase the LCNRV reserve beyond the reported $222 million as of January 31, 2025, or the shrinkage reserve of $427 million as of the same date.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The audit process includes testing controls, recalculating vendor fund amounts, and confirming terms directly with vendors to ensure completeness and accuracy of vendor fund recognition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Vendor funds are recorded as a reduction in inventory cost and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when inventory is sold. Inventory reserves (LCNRV and shrinkage) are calculated based on net inventory values.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If the audit does not confirm accurate vendor fund accruals, the inventory cost basis may be overstated, leading to higher inventory reserves. Therefore, the audit procedures directly impact the financial reporting of inventory reserves."

The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of established reserves, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company's LCNRV inventory reserve was $222 million as of January 31, 2025, and $245 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories. The Company's reserve for inventory shrinkage was $427 million as of January 31, 2025, and $425 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 31, 2025, and February 2, 2024. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and serviced those accounts.  The Company primarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transferred its commercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.

During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables",

The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of established reserves, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company's LCNRV inventory reserve was $222 million as of January 31, 2025, and $245 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories. The Company's reserve for inventory shrinkage was $427 million as of January 31, 2025, and $425 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 31, 2025, and February 2, 2024. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and serviced those accounts.  The Company primarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transferred its commercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale was determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests",

We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMerchandise Inventory - The Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value (LCNRV) using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of established reserves, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company's LCNRV inventory reserve was $222 million as of January 31, 2025, and $245 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories. The Company's reserve for inventory shrinkage was $427 million as of January 31, 2025, and $425 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 31, 2025, and February 2, 2024. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of February 3, 2023. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt.\n\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable - The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\n\nPrior to September 2023, the Company also had an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchased at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and serviced those accounts.  The Company primarily accounted for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transferred its commercial business accounts receivable, it retained certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony's ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale was determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests",

      "question": "How do Lowe's accounting practices for vendor funds impact the recognition of cost of sales, and what specific audit procedures were performed to ensure the accuracy of these funds given their dependency on projected purchase volumes?",
      "answer": "Lowe's receives vendor funds based on purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions, and treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory, which lowers the cost of sales when the inventory is sold. However, due to the diversity of vendor agreements and the dependency on projected annual purchase volumes, Lowe's must perform analyses, review historical trends, and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. These audit procedures were specifically highlighted as part of the critical audit matter in the independent auditor's report, emphasizing the complexity and subjectivity involved in verifying these funds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The auditor explicitly identified 'Merchandise Inventory - Vendor Funds' as a critical audit matter due to the complexity in determining the appropriate recording of vendor funds and their dependency on projected purchase volumes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Lowe's accounting policy states that vendor funds are treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold, and that accruals are based on analyses, historical trends, and vendor confirmations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The audit procedures described in evidence_source_a align with the accounting treatment and risk described in evidence_source_b, showing how Lowe's accounting for vendor funds directly affects the cost of sales and requires specific audit validation due to the risk of misstatement."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 24, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory - Vendor Funds - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.

      "answer": "Lowe's receives vendor funds based on purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions, which are generally recorded as a reduction to inventory cost and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the inventory is sold. Throughout fiscal 2024, Lowe's performed analyses and reviewed historical purchase trends to estimate these funds and adjusted accrual rates accordingly. Additionally, they confirmed actual amounts with select vendors to ensure accuracy. If actual purchase volumes differ from projections\u2014especially in graduated volume-based programs\u2014this could materially affect the amounts accrued and ultimately the cost of sales. This process ensures that vendor funds are recognized in line with actual performance, directly influencing gross margin and inventory valuation.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 24, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory - Vendor Funds - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products. Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product. Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense. Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and ex penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.

These contact centers help Lowe's enable an omnichannel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, assist with order management, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.\n\n## Our Products\n\n## Product Selection\n\nTo meet customers' varying needs, we offer a complete line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating.  We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Appliances, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Lumber, Lawn &amp; Garden, Kitchens &amp; Bath, Hardware, Building Materials, Millwork, Paint, Rough Plumbing, Tools, Electrical, Flooring, and D\u00e9cor.  A typical Lowe's-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items, with additional items available through our online selling channel. Our product assortments offered in-store strive to meet the needs of the local market for the Pro and DIY customer. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data', of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.\n\nWe are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of high-value private brands. We are balancing our value-oriented private brands with our national power brands, intensifying our localization efforts and expanding our rural assortment. In addition, we are dedicated to selling products sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost-effective manner.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.\n\nTo efficiently replenish our stores and meet our customers' expectations for fast fulfillment and delivery, we own and operate more than 120 supply chain facilities in our network. These facilities include regional distribution centers (RDCs), flatbed distribution centers (FDCs), import distribution centers (IDCs), bulk distribution centers (BDCs), cross-dock terminals (XDTs), and Fulfillment Centers (FCs). Fulfillment centers, along with many of our stores, ship product directly to our customers. In addition, we leverage our existing supply chain to deliver directly to our Pro customers. Each one of these distribution nodes plays a critical role in our Total Home strategy and collectively enable our products to get to their destination as efficiently as possible.\n\nThe FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores. Our Pro fulfillment network stocks deeper quantities of our top Pro assortments and has expanded capabilities to handle large orders on multiple flat bed trucks. Our IDCs were expanded to create more capacity to hold import product at the coast, which improves our network's agility to move inventory where and when it is needed. Our BDCs handle appliances and other big and bulky products, and our XDTs fulfill final mile box  truck deliveries of these products.\n\nOur supply chain supports every pillar of our Total Home strategy, and as such, we continue to invest and transform our network to unlock our omnichannel capabilities while keeping our organization's sustainability goals top of mind. As part of the completion of the rollout of our market-based delivery model, we expanded to additional geographic areas and enhanced our distribution capacity for big and bulky products. As of fiscal year 2024, we have finalized the roll-out of our market-based delivery model.\n\nWe have also been focused on improving the speed of our delivery capabilities for our customers. As of fiscal year 2024, most parcel-eligible items fulfilled by Lowe's can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days or less at standard shipping rates. Also, the nationwide expansion of our gig provider network enables same-day delivery of certain products from our stores, and as of fiscal 2024, we have the ability to deliver major appliances next-day in almost every zip code in the United States. Customer needs and buying patterns are constantly changing, and our supply chain will continue to evolve to meet their needs. We are building an omnichannel supply chain that positions the right products in the right quantities in the right places, and operates with greater network capacity with better flow management and optimization.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

      "answer": "Booking Holdings increased marketing expenses in 2023 to drive additional gross bookings and revenues. However, the company's pursuit of higher performance marketing ROIs, combined with external factors like competitors' actions and marketing platform traffic trends, had a negative impact on gross bookings growth rates. Despite improved marketing efficiency (as evidenced by a decrease in marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings), the deliberate focus on ROI optimization constrained the rate of growth in bookings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Marketing expenses increased year-over-year in 2023 to help drive additional gross bookings and revenues, and marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings decreased due to higher performance marketing ROIs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Pursuing a strategy of improving performance marketing ROIs could negatively affect gross bookings and revenue growth rates, and this was influenced by competitors' actions, marketing investment levels, and platform traffic trends.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in marketing spend helped drive gross bookings, but the deliberate focus on improving ROI led to a strategy that constrained growth rates, showing a multi-hop causal relationship between marketing efficiency improvements and reduced bookings growth."
