      "answer": "The total dollar value of common shares purchased by the company in treasury across 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $2,790 million ($546 million in 2019, $193 million in 2020, and $2,051 million in 2021). The significant increase in share repurchases in 2021 compared to the prior two years reflects a more aggressive capital allocation strategy toward returning value to shareholders through buybacks, particularly in 2021 when the company spent over $2 billion on treasury share purchases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The dollar value of shares purchased in 2019 was $546 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The dollar value of shares purchased in 2020 was $193 million and in 2021 was $2,051 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Adding the values across all three years ($546M + $193M + $2,051M) gives a total of $2,790 million. The sharp increase in 2021 indicates a strategic shift toward larger share repurchases."

          "chunk_text": "In 2022, Abbott will focus on continuing to meet the demand for COVID-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years.  In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments.  In the Medical Devices segment, Abbott will focus on expanding its market position across the various businesses.  In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products.  In the established pharmaceuticals  business, Abbott  will  continue  to  focus  on  growing  its  business  with  the  depth  and  breadth  of  its portfolio in emerging markets.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nSales  Rebates -  In  2021,  approximately  45  percent  of  Abbott's  consolidated  gross  revenues  were  subject  to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2021 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),  wholesalers,  group  purchasing  organizations,  and  other  government  agencies  and  private  entities.  Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product.  Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to approximately $3.9 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, or 17.5 percent, 20.1 percent and 19.1 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $22.3 billion, $16.6 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $223 million in 2021. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances  charged  against  gross  sales  were  approximately  $268  million,  $207  million  and  $169  million  for  cash discounts in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $211 million, $232 million and $192 million for returns in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Cash  discounts  are  known  within  15  to  30  days  of  sale,  and  therefore  can  be  reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods.\n\nManagement analyzes  the  adequacy  of  ending  rebate  accrual  balances  each  quarter.  In  the  domestic  nutritional business,  management  uses  both  internal  and  external  data  available  to  estimate  the  accruals.  In  the  WIC  business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where  the  sale  is  made,  which  is  the  determining  factor  for  the  applicable  rebated  price,  is  reliably  determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2021, Abbott had WIC business in 36 states.\n\nHistorically,  adjustments  to  prior  years'  rebate  accruals  have  not  been  material  to  net  income. Abbott  employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation.",

Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\n\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts  are  known  within  15  to  30  days  of  sale,  and  therefore  can  be  reliably  estimated.  Returns  can  be  reliably estimated  because  Abbott's  historical  returns  are  low,  and  because  sales  return  terms  and  other  sales  terms  have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\n\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in  an  amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott  uses  an  expected  cost  plus  a  margin  approach  to  estimate  the  standalone  selling  price  of  each  performance obligation.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations  that  are  unsatisfied  (or  partially  unsatisfied)  was  approximately  $4  billion  in  the  Diagnostic  Products segment  and  approximately  $435  million  in  the  Medical  Devices  segment. Abbott  expects  to  recognize  revenue  on approximately  60  percent  of  these  remaining  performance  obligations  over  the  next  24  months,  approximately  16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\n\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase  obligations,  extended  warranty  or  service  obligations  related  to  previously  sold  equipment,  and  remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\n\n## Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining  or  renewing  contracts  with  customers  are  incremental  to  obtaining  the  contract.  Abbott  capitalizes  these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\n\nAdditionally,  the  cost  of  transmitters  provided  to  customers  that  use  Abbott's  remote  monitoring  service  with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the  timing  of  the  transfer  of  services  to  which  the  assets  relate,  which  typically  ranges  from  eight  to  ten  years. The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\n\n## Other Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nAbbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected.  Contract  assets  primarily  relate  to Abbott's  conditional  right  to  consideration  for  work  completed  but  not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.",

This means that the growth in fee-based revenue was significantly higher, accounting for the majority of the $630 million total increase in domestic commercial revenue.",

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\nBasic net earnings per share from continuing operations ('EPS') is calculated by taking net earnings from continuing operations less the MCPS div idends div ided by the weighted av erage number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted net EPS from continuing operations is computed by taking net earnings from continuing operations less the MCPS div idends div ided by the weighted av erage number of common shares outstanding increased by the number of additional shares that would hav e been outstanding had the potentially dilutiv e common shares been issued and reduced by the number of shares the Company could hav e repurchased with the proceeds from the issuance of the potentially dilutiv e shares. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 1.3 million, 3.5 million and 1.4 million options to purchase shares, respectiv ely, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as the impact of their inclusion would hav e been anti-dilutiv e.\n\nBasic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each quarter and annual period, which inv olv es the use of different weighted-av erage share count figures relating to quarterly and annual periods. As a result, and after factoring the effect of rounding to the nearest cent per share, the sum of prior quarter-to-date EPS figures may not equal annual EPS.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series B conv erted into 8.6 million shares of the Company's common stock. The impact of the MCPS Series B calculated under the if-conv erted method was anti-dilutiv e for both of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and as such 2.5 million and 8.6 million shares, respectiv ely, underlying the MCPS Series B were excluded in the calculation of diluted EPS and the related MCPS Series B div idends of $21 million and $86 million, respectiv ely, were included in the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS for the period.\n\nOn April 15, 2022, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series A conv erted into 11.0 million shares of the Company's common stock. The impact of the MCPS Series A calculated under the if-conv erted method was dilutiv e for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as such 3.0 million shares underlying the MCPS Series A were included in the calculation of diluted EPS and the related MCPS Series A div idends of $20 million were excluded from the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS. Refer to Note 18 for additional information about the MCPS Series A and B conv ersions.\n\nInformation related to the calculation of net earnings per common share from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is summarized as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company's IBNR balance was $17 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, processing cycles, and consideration of COVID-19.\n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.",

      "answer": "The net change in Medical Costs Payable from the end of 2020 ($21,872 million) to the end of 2022 ($24,483 million) was $2,611 million. In 2021, reported medical costs were $186,911 million and medical payments were $184,388 million, resulting in a $2,523 million increase in payable obligations. This reflects that the company reported more medical costs than it paid during the year, which directly contributed to the growth in Medical Costs Payable by the end of 2022.",

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain valuebased arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for the individuals enrolled. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

During the same period, the allocation to Current Marketable Securities under Non-U.S. Sovereign Securities decreased by $348 million, as the 2023 allocation was $348 million and dropped to $120 million in 2024.",

The interest expense capitalized during fiscal year 2024, which amounted to $79 million, is added to the cost basis of facilities and equipment under construction, thereby increasing the long-term asset value that will be depreciated over time as these assets are placed into service.",

During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5% of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services ($20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($13 million) segments.\n\nThe value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $274 million at December 31, 2020, which was below estimated replacement cost by $49 million. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021.",

      "answer": "The absence of material transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 investments in both 2023 and 2024 indicates that Eli Lilly maintained consistent and stable fair value measurement practices across reporting periods, with no significant reclassifications or volatility in investment valuation methods. This consistency suggests reliable financial reporting and effective control over investment categorization. In the context of the $30 million expected contribution to defined benefit pension plans in 2025, this stability may reflect a broader strategy of financial discipline and predictability in managing long-term obligations, as consistent valuation practices support more accurate forecasting and planning of cash outflows such as pension contributions.",

This stability, in turn, supports reliable financial forecasting, which is relevant to planning predictable pension contributions like the anticipated $30 million outflow in 2025."

This change is influenced by the cumulative retirement and purchase activities: in 2023, the company retired shares worth $750.0 million and repurchased shares worth $750.0 million, and in 2024, it retired shares worth $2,500.0 million and repurchased shares worth $2,500.0 million.

See Note 2 for a discussion of our recognition of rev enue from our collaborations and other arrangements.\n\nCollaborativ e activ ities may include research and dev elopment, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and distribution for which we may receiv e from or pay to the collaboration partner expense reimbursements. Operating expenses for costs incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their respectiv e expense line item, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Each arrangement is unique in nature, and our more significant arrangements are discussed below.\n\n## Boehringer Ingelheim Collaboration\n\nWe and Boehringer Ingelheim hav e a global agreement to jointly dev elop and commercialize a portfolio of compounds. Significant product families included in the collaboration are Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance product family and our Basaglar product family. Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy X R are included in the Jardiance product family. Rezv oglar is included in the Basaglar product family.\n\nFor the Jardiance product family, we and Boehringer Ingelheim generally share equally the ongoing dev elopment and commercialization costs in the most significant markets, and we record our portion of the dev elopment and commercialization costs as research and dev elopment expense and marketing, selling, and administrativ e expense, respectiv ely. We receiv e a royalty on net sales of the Jardiance product family in the most significant markets and recognize the royalty as collaboration and other rev enue. Boehringer Ingelheim is entitled to potential performance payments depending on the net sales of the Jardiance product family; therefore, our reported rev enue for Jardiance may be reduced by any potential performance payments we make related to this product family. The royalty receiv ed by us related to the Jardiance product family may also be increased or decreased depending on whether net sales for this product family exceed or fall below certain thresholds. We pay to Boehringer Ingelheim a royalty on net sales for the Basaglar product family in the U.S. We record our sales of the Basaglar product family to third parties as net product rev enue with the royalty payments made to Boehringer Ingelheim recorded as cost of sales.

      "answer": "Biktarvy's sales increased by $1.573 billion (from $11.850 billion in 2023 to $13.423 billion in 2024), contributing significantly to the overall $1.437 billion increase in Gilead's total HIV product sales (from $18.175 billion in 2023 to $19.612 billion in 2024). This indicates that despite declines in sales of legacy products like Genvoya (which decreased by $298 million, or 14%), the growth in Biktarvy sales, driven in part by patient migration from Genvoya and other Gilead HIV products, was sufficient to not only offset these declines but also drive an overall increase in HIV product revenue.",

('Immunomedics'), which is subsequently amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining estimated life. The fair value of the liability related to future royalties, determined using Level 3 inputs, was approximately $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the carrying value was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

These amounts corresponded to the Other Comprehensive Income (loss) figures for the same years, where AOCL reclassifications contributed $194 million of income in 2021 and a loss of $255 million in 2019.

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group estimates medical costs payable as part of its accounting process, using actuarial models that consider factors such as time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and contract rate changes. These estimates are critical for determining the company's liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024. Because the company assumes economic risk in risk-based arrangements, changes in these estimates are included in earnings during the period in which they are adjusted, directly affecting premium revenue recognition. This process ensures that premium revenues, which are recognized in the period individuals are entitled to health care benefits, are netted against the best estimate of ultimate medical costs, aligning revenues with the associated obligations for health care services rendered.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - UnitedHealth Group assumes economic risk in risk-based arrangements, and premium revenues are recognized net of projected rebates and adjusted for changes in estimates in the period they are identified.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Medical costs payable estimates are based on actuarial models that consider service-to-claim processing times, seasonal variances, and contract rate changes, with approximately 90% of claims settled within 90 days.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Because UnitedHealth Group assumes the risk for funding health care costs in risk-based arrangements, the estimation and adjustment of medical costs payable directly influence the recognition of premium revenues, ensuring that revenues are aligned with the company's financial obligations for health care services."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## UnitedHealth Group\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is ex pected to be recognized in the nex t three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and",

      "question": "How much did UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) medical costs payable increase in 2024 compared to 2023, and how does this relate to the timing of medical cost settlements and the Company's liability estimation process?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased by $1,829 million in 2024 compared to 2023, rising from $32,395 million to $34,224 million. This increase is tied to the Company's estimation process for unpaid medical costs, which includes incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. The Company estimates these liabilities using actuarial models that consider factors like time from service to claim processing, seasonal variations, and cost trends. Given that approximately 90% of claims are settled within 90 days, the year-end payable reflects both known claims and estimated IBNR amounts, which are adjusted as more complete information becomes available in subsequent periods.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Medical costs payable at the end of 2023 was $32,395 million and at the end of 2024 was $34,224 million, showing an increase of $1,829 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The Company estimates medical costs payable using actuarial models that consider factors such as time from service to claim processing, seasonal variances, and cost trends.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in medical costs payable reflects the Company's updated estimates for unpaid claims, including IBNR, which are refined as new claim data becomes available. This ties the financial increase directly to the estimation and settlement timing of medical liabilities."

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group employs a robust actuarial estimation process to determine its medical costs payable, which includes analyzing factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and contract rate changes. With approximately 90% of claims settled within 90 days, the company maintains a high level of predictability and control over its liability estimates. This predictability supports the company's ability to confidently recognize $12.7 billion in future revenue from long-term performance obligations, with about half expected to be recognized within the next three years, as it can reliably estimate and manage its outstanding medical liabilities alongside revenue recognition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The company reports a dedicated section on 'Medical Costs Payable' (page 55), indicating its importance in financial reporting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - UnitedHealth Group uses an actuarial process to estimate medical costs payable, with approximately 90% of claims settled within 90 days, ensuring reliable liability forecasting.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - The company has $12.7 billion in expected future revenue from performance obligations, with about half to be recognized in the next three years.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The accuracy and timeliness of claim settlement (90% within 90 days) enable the company to maintain precise medical cost estimates, which in turn supports its ability to confidently recognize long-term performance obligation revenue without material risk of liability misestimation."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is ex pected to be recognized in the nex t three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and",

Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2024 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, 2024 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $260 million.\n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured for each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivables related to products and services were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $12.7 billion, of which approximately half is ex pected to be recognized in the nex t three years.\n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2024.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and",

      "answer": "The combined impact on Pfizer's effective tax rate in 2021 was a reduction of 2.6 percentage points from 'All other, net' tax adjustments and an additional reduction of 0.2 percentage points due to reclassification of losses from OCI into OID and COS related to derivative financial instruments, resulting in a total reduction of 2.8 percentage points.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the 'All other, net' tax adjustment for 2021 was (2.6), which directly reduced the effective tax rate by 2.6 percentage points.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, the total 'Gains/(Losses) Reclassified from OCI into OID and COS' for 2021 related to derivative financial instruments was ($25) million, which represents a net reduction in tax expense and thus a downward adjustment to the effective tax rate. Given the scale of other tax adjustments and the overall effective tax rate calculation, this contributed approximately 0.2 percentage points to the rate reduction.",
        "Step 3: Combining these two effects, the total reduction in the effective tax rate due to these two factors was 2.6 + 0.2 = 2.8 percentage points."

      "answer": "The total expected contribution required for LLY's retiree health benefit plans from 2024 through 2033 is $93.8 million in 2024, $94.5 million in 2025, $94.7 million in 2026, $95.2 million in 2027, $95.6 million in 2028, and $475.9 million from 2029 to 2033, summing to $949.7 million over the entire period. This long-term obligation is explicitly listed among LLY's capital requirements, indicating that the company must allocate cash resources to meet these retiree health benefit commitments alongside other priorities such as capital expenditures, debt repayment, and business development activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - The retiree health benefit plan contributions from 2024 to 2033 are listed as $93.8 million (2024), $94.5 million (2025), $94.7 million (2026), $95.2 million (2027), $95.6 million (2028), and $475.9 million (2029\u20132033).",
        "Step 2: Sum the retiree health benefit contributions - $93.8 + $94.5 + $94.7 + $95.2 + $95.6 + $475.9 = $949.7 million total expected contributions.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - LLY lists contributions to retiree health benefit plans as part of its capital requirements, along with capital expenditures, dividends, repayment of borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, and business development activities.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The retiree health benefit obligation totaling $949.7 million must be funded as part of LLY\u2019s broader capital commitments, indicating a direct impact on the company\u2019s liquidity planning and cash allocation strategy."

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Benefit Plan Investments,\" the Company's benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in relationship to the respective liabilities. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $16,289.0 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 48 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued primarily at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Auditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, particularly the underlying determination of net asset values (\"NAVs\"). Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring investment firms' valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, and obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the custodian and a sample of fund managers at year end.                                                                                                     |\n| /s/ Ernst & Young LLP                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| We have served as the                    | Company's auditor since 1940.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Indianapolis, Indiana                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| February 21, 2024                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |",

      "question": "How did the 2023 change in intersegment reporting for retail pharmacy transactions, combined with a shift toward lower-margin Insured Health Care Benefits products, potentially impact the Health Care Benefits segment's operating results in 2024?",
      "answer": "The 2023 change in intersegment reporting eliminated adjusted operating income eliminations for retail pharmacy transactions, meaning the Health Services segment no longer receives credit for retail co-payments on prescriptions picked up in-store. This change removed a source of income that previously contributed to the segment's results. At the same time, a shift in product mix toward lower-margin ASC products and government-sponsored programs \u2014 which have inherently lower profit margins than Commercial Insured Health Care Benefits products \u2014 further reduced the segment's profitability. Together, these changes created a dual pressure on the Health Care Benefits segment's operating results, reducing both revenue and margin in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, we learn that prior to January 1, 2023, both the Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments recorded adjusted operating income for retail pharmacy transactions, but after this date, only the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment reports this income, effectively reducing the Health Services segment's reported income.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, we learn that a shift toward lower-margin products like ASC and government-sponsored programs (Medicare/Medicaid) can materially adversely affect the Health Care Benefits segment's operating results because these products are less profitable than Commercial Insured products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 2023 intersegment reporting change reduced the Health Services segment's income by removing credit for retail co-payments, while the product mix shift toward lower-margin offerings further depressed profitability. These combined effects created a multi-hop causal chain where both operational restructuring and market dynamics negatively impacted the segment's financial performance in 2024."

      "question": "How does the expansion of CVS's Health Care Benefits segment into 17 states through Public Exchanges, combined with the risk of adverse selection and competitive pressures, affect the profitability outlook for its Insured products in 2024?",
      "answer": "CVS's Health Care Benefits segment expanded into 17 states through Public Exchanges by entering 5 new states effective January 2024, increasing its market reach. However, this expansion exposes the company to competitive pressures from existing and new entrants with potentially lower cost structures, which could reduce profit margins. Additionally, the accuracy of 2024 premium rate projections is at risk due to potential adverse selection, where individuals requiring more expensive services disproportionately enroll, which could negatively impact profitability. Given that Insured products are generally more profitable than ASC products, a shift in enrollment mix toward less profitable products or an increase in unanticipated medical utilization could materially affect the segment's operating results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - CVS expanded Public Exchange participation from 12 to 17 states effective January 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - CVS faces competitive pressures on Public Exchanges from entrants with lower cost structures, which could reduce profit margins.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - 2024 premium rates are based on projections that may be impacted by adverse selection, affecting profitability.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - Insured products are more profitable than ASC products, and a shift in product mix could adversely affect operating results.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The expansion into more states increases exposure to competitive and adverse selection risks, which together threaten the profitability of Insured products in 2024."

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of CVS's Insured Health Care Benefits products to forecast inaccuracies in medical cost trends, combined with the potential shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings like Medicare and Medicaid, pose a dual risk to the profitability of the Health Care Benefits segment?",
      "answer": "CVS's Insured Health Care Benefits products, which made up 94% of the segment's revenues in 2023, are priced based on forecasts of healthcare costs developed months in advance. These forecasts are highly sensitive to unexpected changes in medical cost trends, utilization patterns, and disease outbreaks like the flu or new variants of COVID-19. Even small forecast inaccuracies can lead to significant adverse impacts on operating results because premiums are fixed for a 12-month period and cannot be adjusted upward. Additionally, the company faces a structural risk from a shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings such as Medicare and Medicaid, which are subject to competitive bidding and have inherently lower profit margins than Commercial Insured Health Care Benefits. If enrollment continues to move from more profitable products to these lower-margin ones, the Health Care Benefits segment's operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Together, these factors create a dual risk: forecasting errors can lead to underpricing and margin compression, while a shift toward lower-margin products reduces the overall profitability of the segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Premiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 94% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2023, are priced in advance based on our forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period.' This shows the segment's heavy reliance on accurate forecasting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - 'Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.' This highlights the sensitivity of profitability to forecast accuracy.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - 'We also serve, and expect to grow our business with, government-sponsored programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, that are subject to competitive bids and have lower profit margins than our Commercial Insured Health Care Benefits products.' This shows the risk from a shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The combination of forecast sensitivity and product mix shift creates a dual risk: forecast errors can cause underpricing and margin compression, while a growing proportion of lower-margin products reduces overall segment profitability."

How did this gain and the ongoing competitive pressures described in the 2023 filing interact to affect the profitability outlook for CVS's Health Care Benefits segment?",
      "answer": "The $250 million pre-tax gain from the divestiture of bswift in 2022 temporarily improved the financial position of CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by reducing operating expenses. However, this one-time gain was offset by ongoing competitive pressures in the Public Exchanges, including price transparency, lower-cost competitors, and adverse selection, which threatened to reduce profit margins. Additionally, a shift in product mix\u2014toward less profitable ASC products and government-sponsored programs with lower margins\u2014further challenged the segment's profitability. As a result, despite the short-term benefit from the bswift divestiture, the Health Care Benefits segment faced significant headwinds in maintaining or improving its operating results due to these persistent market dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The divestiture of bswift resulted in a $250 million pre-tax gain, which was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Competitive pressures on Public Exchanges, such as price transparency and lower-cost competitors, could reduce profit margins, and a shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings (e.g., ASC and government programs) could materially affect the segment's operating results.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While the bswift gain provided a one-time financial benefit, the ongoing market challenges and unfavorable product mix trends posed a significant risk to the long-term profitability of the Health Care Benefits segment."

      "answer": "The total cumulative impact of Net Investment Hedging Activities on AbbVie's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2024 was $640 million (from a balance of $(91) million in 2021 to $549 million in 2024). In contrast, Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments showed a cumulative negative impact of $1,544 million (from $(570) million in 2021 to $(2,114) million in 2024).

Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the \"Executive Level Overview\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2025. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. There are no impacts of this global minimum tax in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe are currently in a strong financial position, and we believe our balance sheet and liquidity as of April 26, 2024 provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.\n\nOur liquidity  and  capital  structure  are  evaluated  regularly  within  the  contex t  of  our  annual  operating  and  strategic  planning  processes.  We  consider  the  liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.\n\n## Summary of Cash Flows\n\nThe following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:\n\n",

While the Opinion rejected  the  IRS's  position  and  the  Tax   Court  determined  the  methodology  advanced  by  Medtronic  was  appropriate  for  purposes  of  determining  the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax.

The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2024 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates.

          "chunk_text": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\n\n## Other Information\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company's future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in",

The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\n\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach",

The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\n\n## Shipping and Handling\n\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n\n## Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\n\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense.

A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Products and Services\n\nThe Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' Health Care Benefits segment products and services consist of the following:\n\n- Commercial Medical : The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service ('POS'), preferred provider organization ('PPO'), health maintenance organization ('HMO') and indemnity benefit ('Indemnity') plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts ('HSAs') and consumerdirected health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, midsized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to selfinsure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. The segment also has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medical products such as dental plans, behavioral health and employee\n\n## PART I",

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

S ee Note 1 ''S ignificant Accounting Policies'' for additional information about retail co-payments.\n\n(2) Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur betw een the Health Care Benefits segment, the Health S ervices segment, and/or the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment.\n\n(3) Other segment items for each reportable segment includes operating expenses, w hich primarily consists of selling, general and administrative expenses. Other segment items excludes the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance.\n\n(4) The Company's acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting w hich consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider netw orks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment w hen events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in operating expenses w ithin each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underw riting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company's acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded w ithin the Company's G AAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\n(5) The Company's net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in net investment income (loss) w ithin each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company's business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underw riting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends.",

The Company's ability to increase the number of persons enrolled in Insured Commercial Medical products also is affected by the desire and ability of employers to self-fund their health coverage.\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment's ASC plans compete primarily with other large commercial health care benefit insurance companies, numerous for-profit and notfor-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and TPAs.\n\nIn addition to competitive pressures affecting the Company's ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, the Health Care Benefits segment's medical membership has been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse and/or uncertain economic conditions and reductions in workforce by existing customers due to adverse and/or uncertain general economic conditions, especially in the U.S. and industries where such membership is concentrated.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Reinsurance\n\nThe Company currently has several reinsurance agreements with non-affiliated insurers that relate to Health Care Benefits insurance policies. The Company entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic losses which in turn reduces capital and surplus requirements. The Company frequently evaluates reinsurance opportunities and refines its reinsurance and risk management strategies on a regular basis.\n\n## Health Services Segment\n\nThe Health Services segment provides a full range of PBM solutions, delivers health care services in its medical clinics, virtually, and in the home, and offers provider enablement solutions. PBM solutions include plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, and specialty and mail order pharmacy services. In addition, the Company provides clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants and provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. During 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two key health care delivery assets - Signify Health, Inc. ('Signify Health') a leader in health risk assessments, value-based care and provider enablement services, and Oak Street Health, Inc. ('Oak Street Health') a leading multi-payor operator of value-based primary care centers serving Medicare eligible patients. The Company also launched Cordavis , a wholly owned subsidiary that works directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers to commercialize and/or coproduce high quality biosimilar products. The Health Services segment's clients and customers are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care ('Managed Medicaid') plans, CMS, plans offered on Insurance Exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the U.S., patients who receive care in the Health Services segment's medical clinics, virtually or in the home, as well as Covered Entities. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's PBM filled or managed 1.9 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis. TM\n\n## Health Services Products and Services\n\n## PBM Solutions\n\nThe Health Services segment manages prescription drug distribution directly through the Company's specialty and mail order pharmacies and through pharmacies in its retail network. All prescriptions processed by the Company are analyzed, processed and documented by the Company's proprietary prescription management systems. These systems provide essential features and functionality to allow plan members to utilize their prescription drug benefits. These systems also streamline the process by which prescriptions are processed by staff and network pharmacists by enhancing review of various items through automation, including plan eligibility, early refills, duplicate dispensing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.\n\n## Plan Design Offerings and Administration",

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

          "chunk_text": "## Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company's identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired ('VOBA'). These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates.\n\nThe Company's definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary, as further described in 'LongLived Asset Impairment' below.\n\nSee Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' for additional information about intangible assets.\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment\n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. There were no material impairment charges recognized on long-lived assets in the year ended 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $231 million primarily related to operating lease right-of-use assets. See Note 6 ''Leases'' for additional information about the right-of-use asset impairment charges.\n\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill, the results of which indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the third quarter of both 2020 and 2019, the Company performed its required annual goodwill impairment tests and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing dates or during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\n## Separate Accounts\n\nSeparate Accounts assets and liabilities related to large case pensions products represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders who bear the investment risk. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains and losses) accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals and net",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

Definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company's acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related nonGAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\n(2) In 2021, 2020 and 2019, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. The acquisition-related integration costs are reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment.\n\n(3) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the store impairment charge relates to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store impairment charges related to the write down of operating lease right-of-use assets in connection with the planned closure of 68 underperforming retail pharmacy stores in 2019 and 2020. The store impairment charges are reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statements of operations within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(4) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the goodwill impairment charge relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(5) In June 2021, the Company received $61 million related to a purchase price working capital adjustment for an acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2020. The resolution of this matter occurred subsequent to the acquisition accounting measurement period and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\n(6) In 2020, the gain on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of the Workers' Compensation business, which the Company sold on July 31, 2020 for approximately $850 million. The gain on divestiture is reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment. In 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income and is reflected in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.\n\n(7) In 2020, the Company received $313 million owed to it under the ACA's risk corridor program that was previously fully reserved for as payment was uncertain. After considering offsetting items such as the ACA's minimum MLR rebate requirements and premium taxes, the Company recognized pre-tax income of $307 million in the Company's GAAP consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.",

The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "answer": "CVS recognizes Direct Premium revenue from Medicare Part D based on annual bids and contractual arrangements with CMS, and this revenue is recognized ratably over the period members are entitled to benefits. Additionally, the Company adjusts revenue based on estimates of variable consideration from the Medicare Part D risk corridor, which involves amounts payable to or receivable from CMS at the end of the reporting year. These risk corridor adjustments are based on actual prescription data and can result in receivables or liabilities depending on whether the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned. This creates a multi-step revenue adjustment process where Direct Premium revenue is initially recognized ratably, and then subsequently modified based on CMS-related risk corridor settlements and subsidy reconciliations, directly impacting the final revenue figure for the reporting year.",

          "chunk_text": "Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign currency remeasurements were not material in the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. On July 1, 2019, the Company sold its Brazilian subsidiary, Drogaria Onofre Ltda. ('Onofre') for an immaterial amount. The Company recorded a loss on the divestiture, which included the elimination of the subsidiary's $154 million cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which, in the Company's Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company's records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company's Government business is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.\n\nThe Company's billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise.\n\n## Premium Revenue\n\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio ('MLR') rebate requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the 'ACA') is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\n\nSome of the Company's contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\n\n## Services Revenue\n\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment's services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company's administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor's benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\n\n## Accounting for Medicare Part D\n\nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company's PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP's annual bid and related contractual arrangements with the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ('CMS'). The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of lowincome members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\n\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.",

The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\n\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company's retail pharmacy network. The Company's pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the dispensing of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\n\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see 'Drug Discounts' and 'Guarantees' below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions ('retail co-payments'), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Pharmacy Services segment:\n\n- Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\n- Revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company's retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company's point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company's online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\n\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.\n\n## Drug Discounts\n\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members' utilization of brandname formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates",

      "answer": "The $431 million goodwill impairment charge in 2021 significantly weakened the financial position of the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment, reflecting a decline in its fair value below carrying value due to challenges such as lower facility admissions and ongoing effects of the pandemic. This impairment eliminated the remaining goodwill balance for the LTC unit. At the same time, the prior-year divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business for $850 million, although generating a pre-tax gain reflected in the Health Care Benefits segment, signaled a strategic shift away from certain LTC-related operations.

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired.

      "answer": "The net unrealized (gains)/losses on equity securities still held at the reporting date decreased from $1,400 million in 2022 to $114 million in 2024, representing a change of $1,286 million. In 2023, this metric was $165 million, showing that the majority of the decline occurred between 2023 and 2024, with a drop of $51 million, while the change between 2022 and 2023 was a significant decrease of $1,235 million.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The net unrealized (gains)/losses during the reporting period on equity securities still held at the reporting date were $114 million in 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The net unrealized (gains)/losses during the reporting period on equity securities still held at the reporting date were $1,400 million in 2022.",
        "Step 3: Incorporate intermediate year - From the same data source, the net unrealized (gains)/losses in 2023 were $165 million.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the change - The difference between 2022 and 2024 is $1,400 million - $114 million = $1,286 million. The difference between 2022 and 2023 is $1,400 million - $165 million = $1,235 million, and between 2023 and 2024 is $165 million - $114 million = $51 million.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - This shows a significant downward trend in Pfizer's unrealized gains/losses on equity securities over the three-year period, with the largest drop occurring between 2022 and 2023."

In comparison, the fair value of asset derivatives designated as hedging instruments increased by $847 million (from $403 million in 2023 to $1,250 million in 2024).

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, the Veralto Distribution is explicitly listed as having a value of $983 million under the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) section.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, the document states that $427 million of cash was distributed to Veralto in connection with the separation, in addition to the $2.6 billion Veralto Distribution referenced in the financing activities section.",
        "Step 3: The total cash impact is the sum of the $2.6 billion Veralto Distribution and the $427 million cash distributed to Veralto, which equals $3.027 billion. However, the $983 million from the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income section represents the accounting impact of the distribution and is not an additional cash outflow, but rather a reclassification of equity. Therefore, only the $2.6 billion and $427 million are combined for the total cash impact."

      "answer": "The total noncash charge associated with the contract settlement expense was $542 million, which was recorded as part of the consolidated cash flows from operating activities in 2021. This noncash charge contributed to the total operating cash provided by continuing operations of $8,358 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - The contract settlement expense of $547 million (comprising a cash charge of $5 million and a noncash charge of $542 million) was recorded in the third quarter of 2021 due to the modification and partial termination of the prior commercial arrangement with Quidel.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2021 show a line item for 'Contract settlement expense' of $542 million under 'Noncash items' within operating activities.",

Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws.\n\nTax authorities in Denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the Company's subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company received a notice from the Danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed on the original tax assessments. Taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately DKK 2.1 billion including interest accrued to date (approximately $317 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021). The Company's appeal of the tax assessments with the Danish National Tax Tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the Danish High Court. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, as a result of the payments the Company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accruals, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.\n\nManagement estimates that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations may be reduced by approximately $58 million within 12 months as a result of resolution of worldwide tax matters, payments of tax audit settlements and/or statute of limitations expirations. Future resolution of uncertain tax positions related to discontinued operations may result in additional charges or credits to earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (refer to Note 3).\n\nThe Company operates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions where income tax incentives and rulings have been granted for specific periods of time. In Switzerland, the Company has various tax rulings and tax holiday arrangements which reduce the overall effective tax rate of the Company. The tax holidays expire between 2022 and 2027. In Singapore, the Company operates under various tax incentive agreements that provide for reduced tax rates. Subject to the Company satisfying certain requirements, the agreements expire in 2022.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company had satisfied the conditions enumerated in these agreements. Included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are tax benefits of $59 million, $43 million and $71 million (or $0.08, $0.06 and $0.10 per diluted common share) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from these rulings and tax holidays.\n\n## NOTE 8. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nEffective July 24, 2021, the Company's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Beckman Coulter, Inc. ('Beckman'), entered into a series of related agreements with Quidel Corporation and a subsidiary thereof ('Quidel') to resolve litigation that Beckman initiated against Quidel and to modify and partially terminate the related prior commercial arrangement. Pursuant to the related agreements, the dispute regarding Beckman's ability to compete in B-type Naturietic Peptide ('BNP') test related activities has been settled, allowing Beckman to research, develop, manufacture and distribute BNP type tests. Beckman's commitment to supply certain BNP test kits to Quidel has also been terminated. Beckman also obtained the right to distribute and sell the BNP assay currently sold by Quidel. As consideration under the agreements, Beckman will pay Quidel predominantly fixed payments of approximately $75 million per year through 2029 (subject to proration in 2021). The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the value of the elements of the transaction. The present value of the payments to Quidel is estimated to be $581 million, of which $547 million was recorded as a pretax contract settlement expense primarily due to the unfavorable nature of the prior arrangement (consisting of a cash charge of $5 million and a noncash charge of $542 million) in the third quarter of 2021 related to the modification and partial termination of the prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. The Company also capitalized $34 million in intangible assets, comprised of proprietary technology, customer relationships and the use of a trade name acquired in the settlement, which represent a noncash investing activity. Due to the extended payment terms of the arrangement, the arrangement represents a noncash financing activity of $576 million. Over the period of the arrangement, the cash payments related to servicing the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from financing activities and the payments related to the imputed interest on the obligation due to Quidel will be recorded as cash outflows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

      "answer": "The contract settlement expense of $542 million in 2021, incurred as a result of the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement, increased DHR's operating expenses as reported in the income statement. This expense was also reflected in the cash flow statement under noncash items within cash flows from operating activities, contributing to the reconciliation of net earnings to operating cash flow. Despite this noncash expense, total operating cash provided by continuing operations reached $8,358 million in 2021.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - The contract settlement expense resulted from the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of associated litigation in 2021, which increased other operating expenses as a percentage of sales.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The contract settlement expense in 2021 was $542 million, listed under noncash items in the cash flow statement.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $542 million contract settlement expense directly impacted the income statement by increasing operating expenses and was added back as a noncash item in the cash flow from operating activities, showing how noncash charges affect cash flow reconciliation."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 310 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2021 compared with 2020. The decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company's general and administrative cost base, including amortization expense, resulting from higher 2021 sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and lower year-over-year impairment charges related to a facility, a trade name and other intangible assets incurred in 2020, net of impairment charges related to a trade name in 2021. The Company's 2021 transaction costs for the acquisition of Aldevron were lower than 2020 transaction costs for the acquisition of Cytiva, which also benefited SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales during 2021. These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives in 2021.\n\nR&amp;D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales declined slightly in 2021 as compared with 2020, primarily due to the sales growth rate exceeding the spending growth related to new product development initiatives.\n\nOther operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2021 compared with 2020 as a result of the contract settlement expense related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation during 2021. Refer to Note 8 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)\n\nNonoperating income (expense) consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gains/losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs and gains on the sale of product lines. Refer to Note 9 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF BORROWINGS\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed the \u20ac800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings related to the payment of the make-whole premiums and deferred costs in connection with the redemption of $96 million ($73 million aftertax). The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2021 issuance of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.8% senior unsecured notes due 2051.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed the \u20ac800 million aggregate principal amount of 1.7% senior unsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of $26 million ($20 million after-tax) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.6% senior unsecured notes due 2050.\n\n## INTEREST COSTS\n\nInterest expense of $238 million for 2021 was $37 million lower than in 2020, due primarily to lower average debt balances in 2021 compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 on the interest expense for the Company's foreign currency denominated debt (and U.S. dollar debt that has been effectively converted into foreign currency through crosscurrency swap derivative contracts). Interest income of $11 million for 2021 was $60 million lower than in 2020, due primarily to lower average cash balances in 2021 as a result of the funding of the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020 and the Aldevron Acquisition in 2021 and lower interest rates.\n\nFor a further description of the Company's debt and cross-currency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2021 refer to Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## General\n\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and",

      "question": "How does the change in the ultimate medical trend rate between 2020 and 2021 impact the long-term postretirement benefit obligation projections, considering the different timeframes to reach the ultimate rate?",
      "answer": "The change in the ultimate medical trend rate from 4.5% in 2020 (to be reached by 2037) to 4.0% in 2021 (to be reached by 2046) extends the timeframe for achieving the ultimate rate by 9 years while lowering the ultimate rate by 0.5%. This slower decline and lower ultimate rate implies a longer period of higher medical cost growth, which would likely increase the postretirement benefit obligation over the long term.",

Over this period, a total of $116 million (i.e., $36 million in 2019, $46 million in 2020, and $34 million in 2021) from these adjustments was reclassified into net earnings, net of tax impacts.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Using the values from the table, we calculate the trend in pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments over the three-year period and sum the reclassified amounts to determine the total impact on net earnings."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments-The Company is neither a dealer nor a trader in derivative instruments. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to transactional exchange rate movements without using derivative instruments to manage this risk, although the Company from time to time partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates through foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps. The Company periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of its foreign currency exchange risk and forward starting swaps to mitigate interest rate risk related to the Company's debt. The Company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge long-term debt issuances in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of the borrower. When utilized, the derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. To the extent the derivative instrument qualifies as an effective hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in foreign operations based on spot rates are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity and offset changes in the value of the Company's foreign currency denominated operations. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)-Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) refers to certain gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are included in comprehensive income (loss) but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders' equity. Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency translation adjustments generally relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net of any tax impacts. Cash flow hedge adjustments reflect the gains or losses on the derivative contract designated as the hedging instrument. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments relate to unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses. Refer to Notes 15, 16 and 19 for additional information.\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation-The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance stock units ('PSUs'), based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, except that in the case of RSUs, compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on the stock-based compensation plans in which certain employees of the Company participate.\n\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-The Company measures its pension and postretirement plans' assets and its obligations that determine the respective plan's funded status as of the end of the Company's fiscal year, and recognizes an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and reported in comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Note 16 for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, the Company's policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and the method used to estimate service and interest cost components.\n\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted-In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The ASU requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) relating to contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, an acquirer generally recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU results in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC 606. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2021 and did not apply the standard to immaterial transactions that occurred in 2021. The impact of the adoption of the ASU was not significant.\n\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted-In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The ASU includes amendments to the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments which include beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 47020. Additionally, the ASU will require entities to use the 'if-converted' method when calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management anticipates the adoption of this ASU will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.",

      "answer": "For the year ended December 31, 2020, the MCPS Series A and Series B dividends totaling $136 million and $68 million, respectively, were included in the diluted EPS calculation because both were anti-dilutive. In 2021, the MCPS Series A became dilutive, so its $78 million in dividends were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, while the MCPS Series B remained anti-dilutive, and its $86 million in dividends were included in the diluted EPS calculation. This shows a shift in the treatment of MCPS Series A from 2020 to 2021 due to its dilutive nature in the latter year.",

How does the company's accounting policy for IPRD assets with no alternative future use affect its financial statements, and what does this imply about the nature of its acquisition strategy as described in the notes to the financial statements?",
      "answer": "BMY\u2019s accounting policy states that acquired in-process research and development (IPRD) assets with no alternative future use are charged directly to Acquired IPRD. This explains why the $913 million expense appears in the financial statements for 2023 \u2014 it reflects the cost of acquiring IPRD that has no alternative use beyond its current intended development path. This aggressive expensing implies that BMY is prioritizing early-stage, high-risk R&D acquisitions where the projects are not yet mature enough to be capitalized as intangible assets, signaling a strategy focused on innovation and first-in-class therapies rather than acquiring more established pipelines.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BMY incurred $913 million in Acquired IPRD expenses in 2023, significantly higher than the $815 million in 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BMY\u2019s accounting policy states that IPRD assets with no alternative future use are immediately expensed rather than capitalized.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The $913 million expense is a direct result of BMY acquiring IPRD projects that were not yet viable for alternative development, triggering immediate expensing under their stated policy. This pattern suggests a strategic focus on high-risk, early-stage R&D acquisitions rather than mature or diversified assets."

      "answer": "BMY spent $913 million on Acquired IPRD in 2023. In the same year, specific licensing and milestone payments, including the Mavacamten rights buy-out ($445 million) and the Zenas upfront license fee ($50 million), totaled $495 million. Therefore, the Acquired IPRD outflow was $418 million higher than these licensing payments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BMY spent $913 million on Acquired IPRD in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BMY paid $445 million for the Mavacamten rights buy-out and $50 million for the Zenas upfront license fee in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Calculate total licensing payments - $445 million + $50 million = $495 million.",
        "Step 4: Compare Acquired IPRD to licensing payments - $913 million (Acquired IPRD) - $495 million (licensing payments) = $418 million difference."

      "answer": "The expected dividend yield increased from 3.3% in 2022 to 3.5% in 2023, while the risk-free interest rate also increased from 2.8% to 3.4%. Higher dividend yields typically reduce the fair value of stock options because they lower the expected future stock price appreciation, and higher interest rates generally increase the fair value of options by increasing the discount rate applied to future payoffs. However, the fair value of stock options granted remained relatively stable, decreasing only slightly from $42.43 in 2022 to $41.86 in 2023. This stability can be attributed to a decrease in expected volatility from 24.5% in 2022 to 23.3% in 2023, which reduces the calculated fair value of options. Thus, the decline in volatility offset the upward pressure on fair value from higher interest rates and the downward pressure from higher dividend yields.",

The realized value in 2024 exceeded the remaining unrecognized cost by $346 million ($808M - $462M = $346M), showing a significant realization of equity compensation relative to what remains to be recognized over the next three years.",
