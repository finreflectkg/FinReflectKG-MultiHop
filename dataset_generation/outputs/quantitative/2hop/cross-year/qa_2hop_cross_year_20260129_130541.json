      "question": "How has the financial performance of Other Bets evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the segment's trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Other Bets segment reported revenues of $1.527 billion, reflecting an improvement from the prior year with a decrease in operating loss by $541 million, primarily due to revenue growth and reduced valuation-based compensation liabilities. By 2024, the segment's revenues further increased to $1.648 billion, indicating continued, albeit moderate, growth. This trajectory suggests that Other Bets has been gradually improving financially, though the pace of growth remains relatively modest.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Other Bets generated $1.527 billion in revenue and experienced a reduction in operating loss, signaling improvement.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Other Bets' revenues rose further to $1.648 billion, showing continued growth but at a moderate pace.",
        "Step 3: The change from 2023 to 2024 indicates a stable and slightly upward trajectory for the segment, with moderate growth in revenues and ongoing cost management."

      "question": "How has Disney's treatment and recognition of affiliate fees evolved between fiscal 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of revenue recognition methodology and contextual disclosures?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney provided a detailed explanation of its revenue recognition methodology for affiliate fees, stating that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber numbers. Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Disney explicitly described its revenue recognition policy for affiliate fees, including treatment of fixed and guaranteed fees.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the revenue recognition methodology was not repeated; instead, affiliate fees were referenced in relation to subscriber level fluctuations and segment-specific revenue sources.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in disclosure focus from accounting methodology to business context and performance drivers, reducing granular detail on recognition practices."

When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were fifty-two week years. Fiscal 2020 was a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:\n\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Operating labor\n- Facilities and infrastructure costs\n\nSignificant tangible product revenues include:\n\n- The sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our retail locations\n- The sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs\n- The sale of books, comic books and magazines\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:\n\n- Costs of goods sold\n- Operating labor\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Retail occupancy costs\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate's customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n- Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\n\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\n\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 (the date the Company adopted accounting guidance that was applied prospectively) was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content. Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.\n\nThe classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title's monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title's capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\n\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic television series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\n\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\n\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.\n\nAcquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition. Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs for produced and acquired content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services. Amortization of content assets is primarily included in 'Cost of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments. For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nFor U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period ex change rates, ex cept for non-monetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\n\nFor local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and ex penses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, food, materials and supplies. Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, food, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\n## Film and Television Content Costs\n\nThe Company classifies its capitalized produced and acquired/licensed content costs as long-term assets ('Produced and licensed content costs' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and classifies advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event as short-term assets ('Content advances' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet). For produced content, we capitalize all direct costs incurred in the physical production of a film, as well as allocations of production overhead and capitalized interest. For licensed and acquired content, we capitalize the license fee or acquisition cost, respectively. For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:\n\n- Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g. theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)\n- Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)\n\nThe determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content. Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.\n\nWe generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets. We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets. The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title's monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g. content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service). When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title's capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.\n\nProduction costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues). For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films. For episodic series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. Participations and residuals are ex pensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.\n\nProduction costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.\n\nLicensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",

When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were fifty-two week years. Fiscal 2020 was a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:\n\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Operating labor\n- Facilities and infrastructure costs\n\nSignificant tangible product revenues include:\n\n- The sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our retail locations\n- The sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs\n- The sale of books, comic books and magazines\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:\n\n- Costs of goods sold\n- Operating labor\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Retail occupancy costs\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate's customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, audience ratings were identified as a risk factor affecting advertising revenue, with declining viewership and measurement methodologies posing challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers,  and  shifting  business  models  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  businesses  and  results  of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company reported foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $9.6 billion related to its foreign operations, primarily at Sky and NBCUniversal, with the majority being indefinite carryforwards. By 2023, Sky's portion of debt subject to one-way guarantees decreased from $5.2 billion in 2022 to $3.6 billion in 2023, indicating a reduction in direct financial exposure. This suggests a strategic or structural shift in the company's relationship with Sky, as both the deferred tax implications and guaranteed debt associated with the segment evolved over the two years.",

The determination of the realization of the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our subsidiaries'  taxable  income  or  loss,  apportionment  percentages,  redetermination  from  taxing  authorities,  and state and foreign laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards. We recognize a valuation allowance if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our valuation allowance was primarily related to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\n## Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n\n",

By 2023, the company formalized its approach by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for certain advertisements and defers a portion of the revenue when there is a shortfall, typically resolving it by providing additional advertising units within one year.

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's variable-rate debt was $500 million maturing in 2024 and $3,148 million thereafter, with average interest rates of 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively. By 2023, the company's variable-rate debt had shifted significantly to $200 million maturing in 2024, with no debt scheduled for 2025 onward, and the average interest rate increased to 6.0% for 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in variable-rate debt exposure and a rise in borrowing costs in the later year.",

        "Step 1: Identify the distribution and average interest rate of variable-rate debt in 2022, which was $500 million in 2024 and $3,148 million thereafter with respective interest rates of 1.7% and 4.4%.",

These expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers, including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, and the impacts in 2020  of  adjustment  provisions  in  our  programming  distribution  agreements  with  regional  sports  networks  related  to  canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers.\n\nWe expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases, although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of contract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\n\n## Technical and Product Support Expenses\n\nExpenses  include  costs  to  complete  service  call  and  installation  activities;  costs  for  network  operations,  product  development, fulfillment and provisioning; the cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving service, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\n\n## Customer Service Expenses\n\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\n\n## Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\n\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\n\nExpenses  increased  in  2021  primarily  due  to  increased  spending  associated  with  attracting  new  customers  and  promoting  our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics, as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\n## Franchise and Other Regulatory Fees\n\nExpenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities, including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs.\n\n## Other Expenses\n\nExpenses  primarily  include  administrative  personnel  costs;  fees  paid  to  third-party  channels  for  which  Cable  represents  the advertising sales efforts; other business support costs, including building and office expenses, taxes and billing costs; and bad debt.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\n\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin was 43.7%, 42.1% and 40.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in 2020.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, Comcast used its three Cable Communications divisions as the unit of account for testing the impairment of cable franchise rights and performed either qualitative or quantitative assessments annually or more frequently if there were substantive changes in circumstances. By 2024, the company continued to perform annual impairment testing as of July 1 and maintained the use of qualitative assessments first, but placed more emphasis on periodic quantitative assessments to support qualitative conclusions.

Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or  substantive  changes  in  circumstances  occur.  The  purchase  of  spectrum  rights  is  presented  separately  in  our  consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever  events  or  substantive  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  assets  might  be  impaired.  Our  three  Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value  of  an  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount.  A  quantitative  assessment  is  performed  if  the qualitative  assessment  results  in  a  more-likely-than-not  determination  or  if  a  qualitative  assessment  is  not  performed.  When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets  primarily  based  on  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  that  involves  significant  judgment.  When  analyzing  the  fair  values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinitelived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated  fair  value  and  the  carrying  value  of  the  assets.  Unless  presented  separately,  the  impairment  charge  is  included  as  a component of amortization expense.

Comcast's obligations under  this  guarantee  are  subordinated  and  subject,  in  right  of  payment,  to  the  prior  payment  in  full  of  all  of  Comcast's  senior  indebtedness,  including  debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast's obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes  payable  to  non-guarantor  subsidiaries  of  $53  billion  and  $104  billion,  respectively,  and  noncurrent  notes  receivable  from  non-guarantor  subsidiaries  of $10 billion and $14 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe believe our estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are  critical  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  Management  has  discussed  the  development  and  selection  of  these  critical  accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. See also Notes 4 and 9.\n\n## Valuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\n\nWe assess the recoverability  of  our  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  including  cable  franchise  rights,  annually  as  of  July  1,  or  more  frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. In connection with our impairment assessment process, from time to time, we perform quantitative assessments of our reporting units and cable franchise rights in order to support our qualitative assessments.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.\n\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. When performing this analysis, we also consider multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Telev ision Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs.

Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows  or  platforms,  such  as  U.S.  and  international  syndication,  home  entertainment,  and  other  distribution  platforms,  are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\n\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and  are  not  subject  to  impairment.  When  performing  an  impairment  assessment,  we  estimate  fair  value  primarily  based  on  a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts.

We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.\n\nOur interest rate derivative financial instruments, which primarily include cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program.\n\nThe effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of $2 million in 2021, a decrease of $9 million in 2020, and a decrease of $49 million in 2019.

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nFilm and television productions may be eligible for tax incentives from certain state, local or foreign jurisdictions. These incentives generally provide for transferable or redeemable tax credits upon meeting established levels of qualified production spending within a participating jurisdiction. We record a receivable for a production tax incentive program when there is a reasonable assurance of collection with a corresponding reduction of capitalized film and television costs, and the related amortization.\n\nWe may enter into co-financing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors  and  the  terms  of  these  arrangements  can  vary,  although  investors  generally  assume  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  proportionate  to  their ownership in the film.  We  account  for  the  proceeds  received  from  the  investor  under  these  arrangements  as  a  reduction  of  our  capitalized  film  costs  and  the investor's interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are used over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in licensed content.\n\n75\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How has the treatment and recognition of Licensed Content Costs evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of amortization methodology and asset classification?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, CMCSA capitalized licensed content costs upon license commencement and content availability, with amortization tied to broadcast schedules and impairment testing primarily at the channel/platform level.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company continued capitalizing licensed content under similar conditions but introduced 'estimated viewing patterns' into amortization and explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets. It also added details on co-financing and tax incentives.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a more detailed and structured treatment of licensed content, with enhanced methodologies and asset classification, suggesting a strategic shift in financial reporting and content valuation."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023\u2014a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the average paying memberships were 69,518 thousand with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.63. By 2023, the average paying memberships dropped to 41,033 thousand, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased to $7.64. This represents a 41% decrease in average paying memberships and a 34% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The combined impact of these changes contributed to a slower revenue growth of only 5% in 2023 compared to the 15% growth in 2022, signaling a significant shift in Netflix's financial performance dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues grew by 7% compared to the prior year, with paid net membership additions totaling 8,903 thousand. By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand. This indicates a significant improvement in user acquisition in 2023 despite a similar revenue growth rate, suggesting more efficient scaling or successful new market penetration.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 41,033 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased to $7.64. This indicates a 17% increase in average paying memberships but a 10% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. Despite the drop in per-member revenue, the significant growth in membership numbers contributed to overall revenue growth, reflecting a strategic shift toward expanding user base rather than maintaining higher per-user revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon reported wireless service receivables at amortized cost of $5,352 million. By 2024, this figure increased significantly to $29.9 billion as part of the net wireless service receivables included in Other Assets and Accounts Receivable, net. This indicates a substantial growth in the company's exposure to wireless service receivables, suggesting a strategic shift toward emphasizing service agreements with extended payment terms, which could increase credit risk but also align with efforts to retain customers through lower upfront costs.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a significant increase in receivables, reflecting a shift in asset composition and an expanded credit exposure tied to wireless service agreements."

      "question": "How has Verizon's treatment of overage usage revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of how it recognizes revenue for postpaid wireless plans with usage that exceeds monthly allowances?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon recognized overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans on a month-to-month basis as the customer exercised their option for incremental services beyond their monthly allowance. In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Verizon explicitly stated that overage usage fees for postpaid plans were recognized when the customer exercised the option, typically on a month-to-month basis.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Verizon reiterated the same revenue recognition timing for overage usage but added more emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these fees, aligning it more closely with the actual usage pattern.",
        "Step 3: The treatment of overage usage revenue remained fundamentally unchanged between 2023 and 2024, but the 2024 disclosure reflects a more detailed articulation of the timing and conditions under which these fees are recognized, indicating a communication evolution rather than a policy shift."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under T opic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.\n\n## Nature of Products and Services\n\n## Telecommunications\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. M onthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability . See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability , and serv ice rev enue is recogniz ed ov er the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\n## Equipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the V erizon brand and other brands.  Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we  have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically  for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, ty pically  ov er a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fix ed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately . See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\n## Wireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The total",

In 2024, the balance increased from $656 million at the beginning of the year to $738 million at the end of the year.

In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment.

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n## 2. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2023, NFLX reported streaming revenues of $33.64 billion, reflecting a 7% increase from the previous year. In 2024, the company disclosed that it had implemented foreign exchange hedging strategies that directly impacted its streaming revenues. Specifically, hedging gains of $124 million were included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024. This indicates that while the core streaming revenue growth trajectory remained positive, the company actively managed foreign exchange risk in 2024, which contributed an incremental $124 million to its reported streaming revenues.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the evolution: while 2023 showed organic growth in streaming revenues, 2024 introduced a new financial risk management strategy (foreign exchange hedging) that directly influenced the revenue metric."

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n## 2. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

      "question": "How did the average paying memberships and their contribution to streaming revenue evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what was the impact on Netflix's overall revenue growth during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average of 222,924 thousand paying memberships, which contributed to a streaming revenue of $31.47 billion. By 2024, the average paying memberships increased to 277,730 thousand, contributing to a significantly higher streaming revenue of $39.00 billion. This represents a 15% increase in average paying memberships and a 16% increase in streaming revenues year-over-year from 2023 to 2024. The growth in paying memberships directly supported Netflix\u2019s ability to scale its revenue, despite only a marginal 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.70 in 2024 (with constant currency adjustments).",

          "chunk_text": "\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the 11% growth in average paying memberships and a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alphabet described Other Bets as earlier-stage technologies that were further afield from the core Google business, emphasizing a long-term view and disciplined portfolio management. By 2024, the focus had evolved to highlight Alphabet's investment in a portfolio of Other Bets at various stages of development, including those in R&D and those beginning to commercialize, with some generating revenue from healthcare services and internet services. This reflects a shift from a purely long-term, exploratory approach to a more structured investment strategy with an emphasis on commercialization and revenue generation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Other Bets were characterized as early-stage, exploratory ventures with a long-term horizon and a focus on moonshots like AI and quantum computing.",
        "In 2024, the description evolved to include a portfolio at various stages of development, explicitly mentioning R&D and early commercialization, with revenue generation already occurring in some areas.",
        "The evolution indicates a strategic shift from pure innovation investment to a more balanced approach that includes scaling and monetizing certain Other Bets."

We continue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai, who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since 2019.\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google.

Our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when  we  were  founded  in  1998.  Since  then,  we  have  evolved  from  a  company  that  helps  people  find  answers  to  a company that also helps people get things done.\n\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Every year, there are trillions of searches on Google, and 15% of the searches we see every day are new. We continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. And Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person's day, no matter where they are.\n\nWe are continually innovating and building new product features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities.

      "answer": "In 2022, Alphabet's Other Bets reported operating losses of $5.281 billion, reflecting a worsening from the $4.476 billion loss in the prior year, indicating continued financial drag. By 2024, while no specific operating loss figures were disclosed, the strategic positioning of Other Bets showed signs of maturation, with the segment generating revenue primarily from healthcare-related services and internet services, and being described as having businesses at various stages of development\u2014from R&D to early commercialization.

By 2024, the segment's revenue sources were described as primarily coming from 'healthcare-related services' and internet services, suggesting a shift from general health technology toward more direct healthcare services. While internet services remained a consistent revenue contributor in both years, the evolution from 'health technology' to 'healthcare-related services' implies a more specialized or clinical orientation in the later year. This change may reflect a strategic pivot toward monetizable healthcare solutions within the Other Bets portfolio.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about Forward-Looking Statements,' Part I, Item 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe have omitted discussion of 2019 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results\n\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services  and  Google  Cloud;  we  also  report  all  non-Google  businesses  collectively  as  Other  Bets.  Other  Bets  include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 'Business' and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\n\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\n\n- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\n\nThe continuing shift  from  an  offline  to  online  world  has  contributed  to  the  growth  of  our  business  since  inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n\n- Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.\n\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\nWe are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those  from  traditional  desktop  search. Additionally,  as  the  market  for  a  particular  device  type  or  modality  matures,  our revenues  may  be  affected.  For  example,  growth  in  the  global  smartphone  market  has  slowed  due  to  various  factors, including  increased  market  saturation  in  developed  countries,  which  can  affect  our  mobile  advertising  revenue  growth rates.\n\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\n\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins.\n\n- As  online  advertising  evolves,  we  continue  to  expand  our  product  offerings,  which  may  affect  our monetization.\n\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play, which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.\n\n- As  users  in  developing  economies  increasingly  come  online,  our  revenues  from  international  markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\n\nThe shift  to  online,  as  well  as  the  advent  of  the  multi-device  world,  has  brought  opportunities  outside  of  the  U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and  advertising  programs  relevant  to  our  users  in  these  markets.  This  has  led  to  a  trend  of  increased  revenues  from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements, which granted its subsidiaries the power to direct the parks' day-to-day operations and strategic development, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter. This indicates a shift from primarily qualitative consolidation justification in 2022 to more detailed quantitative disclosure of the financial obligations tied to the Asia Theme Parks in 2023.",

        "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks based on management agreements that provided operational control, despite less than 50% equity ownership.",
        "In 2023, Disney disclosed specific borrowing amounts tied to the Asia Theme Parks, including $128 million for 2025 and $1,164 million thereafter.",
        "The evolution shows a transition from explaining the rationale for consolidation in 2022 to providing concrete financial exposure figures in 2023, indicating increased transparency or changing financial dynamics in the relationship."

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.",

By 2023, the Entertainment segment generated $1,032 million in operating income, indicating a significant turnaround.

      "question": "How has Disney's financial relationship and risk exposure to the Asia Theme Parks evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of consolidation and debt covenant treatment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) due to its management agreements that gave it the power to direct key activities and receive significant management fees. By 2023, while still consolidating the parks, Disney specifically excluded the Asia Theme Parks from representations, covenants, and events of default in its bank facilities, indicating a strategic move to limit their impact on Disney\u2019s broader financial covenants and risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks due to its management agreements and significant management fees, despite owning less than 50% equity.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the Asia Theme Parks were explicitly excluded from the bank facility\u2019s representations, covenants, and default provisions, signaling a change in how Disney treats their financial exposure.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in Disney\u2019s financial risk management strategy, maintaining operational control and consolidation while reducing the parks' influence on corporate-level debt covenants."

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.",

This growth aligns with AT&T's wireless infrastructure investment activities, including the acquisition of 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110 in early 2022 for $9,079 million, which contributed to the Licenses - Net asset base. The steady increase in this line item suggests ongoing investment in spectrum resources to support network development.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS\n\nSpectrum Auction On February 24, 2021, the FCC announced that AT&amp;T was the winning bidder for 1,621 C-Band licenses, comprised of a total of 80 MHz nationwide, including 40 MHz in Phase I. We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406. We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as 'Licenses - Net' on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. In December 2021, we paid $955 of Incentive Payments for the clearing of Phase I spectrum and estimate that we will be responsible for an additional $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which $650 was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the FCC announced that we were the winning bidder for 1,624 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $123 in the third quarter of 2021 and will pay the remaining $8,956 in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $9,079. We intend to fund the purchase price using cash and short-term investments.\n\nVideo Business On July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV, which is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&amp;T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions. With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, we contributed our U.S. Video business unit to DIRECTV for $4,250 of junior preferred units, an additional distribution preference of $4,200 and a 70% economic interest in common units (collectively 'equity considerations'). Upon close, we received approximately $7,170 in cash from DIRECTV ($7,600, net of $430 cash on hand) and transferred $195 of DIRECTV debt. TPG contributed approximately $1,800 in cash to DIRECTV for $1,800 of senior preferred units and a 30% economic interest in common units. As part of this transaction, we agreed to cover net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract up to a cap of $2,100 over the remaining period of the contract, of which $1,800 was a note payable to DIRECTV.\n\nUnder separate transition services agreements, we will provide DIRECTV certain operational support for up to three years. We also have entered into commercial arrangements, for up to five years, to provide network transport for U-verse products and sales services.\n\nWarnerMedia On May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.",

This indicates a major shift in the company's asset management strategy, as 2022 saw substantial impairments tied to restructuring efforts, while 2023 reflects minimal impairment activity, suggesting stabilization or strategic realignment of core assets.",

        "Step 2: In 2023, the company reported significantly lower impairments at $1,193 million, also from the same financial table.",
        "Step 3: The dramatic decrease indicates a shift in asset management strategy, with 2022 reflecting major restructuring-related impairments and 2023 showing much lower impairment activity."

          "chunk_text": "## OVERVIEW\n\nOperating revenues decreased in 2021, with declines reflecting our July 31, 2021 separation of the U.S. video business, the completion of the sale of our Vrio business unit in November 2021 and the October 2020 sale of wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Also contributing to revenue declines was lower Business Wireline revenues due in part to higher demand for pandemic-related connectivity in the prior year. Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobility equipment and service revenues and gains in broadband service in our Communications segment; higher content and DTC subscription revenues in our WarnerMedia segment; and growth in Mexico wireless operations including favorable foreign exchange impacts.\n\nOperations and support expenses decreased in 2021, with declines reflecting our business divestitures, lower bad debt expense and lower personnel costs associated with our ongoing transformation initiatives. Declines were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher volumes, and higher WarnerMedia programming costs and marketing activities.\n\nAsset impairments and abandonments decreased in 2021, with higher impairments in 2020. Noncash impairment charges in 2020 included $15,508, resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the long-lived assets and goodwill associated with our U.S. video business (see Notes 7 and 9); $2,212 goodwill impairment at our Vrio business unit (see Note 9); and $780 from the impairment of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, with approximately $524 resulting from the continued shutdown of theaters during the pandemic and the hybrid distribution model for our 2021 film slate (see Note 11). In 2021, we took an additional Vrio impairment of $4,555, resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the net assets of Vrio (see Note 6).\n\n## Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2021.\n\nAmortization expense decreased $3,779, or 47.2%, in 2021, primarily due to ceasing amortization on Video and Vrio held-for-sale assets.\n\nDepreciation expense decreased $1,875, or 9.1%, in 2021, primarily due to the lower cost basis of property, plant and equipment resulting from Video impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 and ceasing depreciation on Video and Vrio held-for-sale assets in 2021.\n\nOperating income increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. Our operating margin was 13.8% in 2021, compared to 3.7% in 2020 and 15.4% in 2019.\n\nInterest expense decreased in 2021, primarily due to lower interest rates and capitalized interest associated with the spectrum acquisitions, partially offset by higher debt balances.\n\nEquity in net income (loss) of affiliates increased in 2021, primarily due to the close of our transaction with TPG related to the U.S. video business, which resulted in our accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting beginning August 1, 2021 (see Notes 6 and 20).\n\nOther income (expense) - net increased in 2021, primarily due to the recognition of $4,140 in actuarial gains, compared to losses of $4,169 in 2020, and recognition of $1,405 of debt redemption costs in 2020. Also contributing to increased income were higher net pension and postretirement benefit credits from higher prior service credit amortization (see Note 15) and net gains on the sale of assets (see Note 6).\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2021, primarily driven by increased income before income taxes, offset primarily by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) benefit of U.S. federal Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryback and benefits on divestitures in 2021.\n\nOur effective tax rate was 20.3% in 2021, (33.8)% in 2020, and 18.9% in 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by our impairment of Vrio and Video goodwill, which was not deductible for tax purposes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T was still in the process of separating the WarnerMedia business, with disclosures focusing on the uncertainty and expectations around the divestiture and its financial impact. By 2023, the WarnerMedia business had met the criteria for discontinued operations, and AT&T began formally reporting it as such, including detailed summaries of its operating results within discontinued operations. This reflects a clear strategic shift from planning to execution and full separation of the segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AT&T referenced the WarnerMedia separation as part of business transformation initiatives with uncertainty around achieving expectations for financial impact.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, WarnerMedia was classified as discontinued operations, indicating the separation was completed and now being reported as a distinct financial category.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a planned strategic move in 2022 to a realized and formally reported discontinued operation in 2023 shows a significant transformation in the relationship between AT&T and WarnerMedia."

PROPERTIES\n\nOur properties do not lend themselves to description by character and location of principal units. At December 31, 2021, of our total property, plant and equipment, central office equipment represented 30%; outside plant (including cable, wiring and other noncentral office network equipment) represented 24%; other equipment, comprised principally of wireless network equipment attached to towers, furniture and office equipment and vehicles and other work equipment, represented 26%; land, building and wireless communications towers represented 13%; and other miscellaneous property represented 7%.\n\nFor our Communications segment, substantially all of the installations of central office equipment are located in buildings and on land we own. Many garages, administrative and business offices, wireless towers, telephone centers and retail stores are leased. Property on which communication towers are located may be either owned or leased.\n\nFor our WarnerMedia segment, we own or lease offices; studios; technical, production and warehouse spaces; communications facilities and other properties in numerous locations globally.\n\n## ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nWe are a party to numerous lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this report, we do not believe any pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are subject are required to be disclosed as material legal proceedings pursuant to this item, but have included the below as a matter of general information.\n\nRecently, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois informed us that they are considering filing a charge against one of our subsidiaries, Illinois Bell Telephone Company, LLC (Illinois Bell), arising out of a single, nine-month consulting contract in 2017 worth twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars. Since 2019, Illinois Bell has been cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office concerning their widely reported investigation of certain elected Illinois politicians and related parties for corruption. Based on our own extensive investigation of the facts and our engagement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, we have concluded that the contract at issue was legal in all respects and that any charge against Illinois Bell or its personnel would be without merit. We cannot predict the outcome of the government's investigation, which could (i) result in criminal penalties, fines, or other remedial measures, (ii) adversely affect our reputation with customers, regulators, and other stakeholders, and (iii) impact our existing federal and state government contracts and our ability to win new contracts in the future.\n\n## ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot applicable.\n\n25",

      "question": "How did Disney's disclosure about the revenue significance of affiliate fees evolve between 2023 and 2024 across its Sports and Entertainment segments, particularly in relation to ESPN+ and Linear Networks?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney's Sports segment highlighted affiliate fees as a significant revenue source, specifically tied to ESPN and its various channels, including ESPN+ as a DTC service. The filing noted that affiliate fees varied with MVPD subscriber levels, indicating a strong link between distribution and revenue. By 2024, the focus shifted in the Entertainment segment, where affiliate fees were described more broadly as part of a diversified revenue model that included subscription fees, advertising, and content licensing. While ESPN+ was still relevant, the 2024 filing emphasized the broader role of affiliate fees across Linear Networks, including ABC-affiliated stations, rather than focusing on the Sports segment alone. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward integrating affiliate fee revenue within a more generalized media ecosystem, rather than isolating it to sports programming.",

        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift from segment-specific emphasis (Sports) to a more integrated view across the company, reflecting a broader strategic positioning of affiliate fees within Disney\u2019s overall distribution and revenue framework."

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney explicitly reported a decrease in theatrical distribution revenue, indicating it was a factor contributing to the decline in Entertainment segment revenues. By 2024, while the company no longer mentioned a decline, it continued to list theatrical distribution as a component of Content Sales/Licensing, suggesting the business line remained operationally relevant but potentially stabilized or less emphasized. This shift implies a possible recalibration in how Disney views theatrical releases within its broader monetization strategy, potentially signaling stabilization or a strategic pivot toward other content distribution channels.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Disney explicitly states that theatrical distribution revenues decreased and contributed to a decline in overall Entertainment segment revenues.",

        "Step 3: The change from a stated decline in 2023 to a neutral but continued presence in 2024 indicates a shift in the role theatrical distribution plays within Disney\u2019s broader content monetization approach."

      "answer": "In 2023, affiliate fees were identified as a major revenue source for the Linear Networks business, which included domestic channels such as ABC Network, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX Channels, and National Geographic Channels. These fees were described as being largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming provided and the competitive market for programming services. By 2024, affiliate fees were more broadly categorized under the significant revenues of the Entertainment segment and explicitly defined as fees charged to multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) and affiliated television stations. Additionally, in 2024, the structure of the Entertainment segment was clarified to include international Disney, FX, National Geographic, and Star-branded channels, suggesting a broader geographic scope for affiliate fee generation. This evolution indicates a more structured and globally integrated approach to affiliate fee generation by 2024.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, affiliate fees were a core revenue component of the Linear Networks business, which included domestic channels like ABC Network and Disney Channels, with fees dependent on programming quality and market competition.",

      "answer": "Domestic Distribution Revenue increased steadily from $10,525 million in 2022 to $10,663 million in 2023, and further to $11,826 million in 2024. In 2023, this growth was specifically noted as a partial counterbalance to declines in domestic advertising and other revenue within the Media Segment. By 2024, Domestic Distribution Revenue had become a more pronounced contributor, helping to support the Media Segment's total revenue growth from $25,355 million in 2023 to $28,148 million in 2024. This indicates that Domestic Distribution Revenue not only maintained its importance but also increasingly supported the segment's financial performance over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Domestic Distribution Revenue was $10,525 million, and by 2023 it increased to $10,663 million, showing early growth.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Domestic Distribution Revenue rose further to $11,826 million, becoming a stronger contributor to the overall Media Segment revenue, which reached $28,148 million from $25,355 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: The year-over-year increases in Domestic Distribution Revenue indicate a growing and stabilizing role within the Media Segment, particularly as other revenue categories like advertising declined."

      "answer": "In 2023, International Networks Revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from the distribution of sports networks. By 2024, this revenue stream grew further, reaching $4,282 million from $4,109 million in 2023. The 2024 financial table reflects this upward trend but does not explicitly state the causal drivers for the increase. However, the sustained growth from 2023 to 2024 indicates continued strength in international distribution, particularly in sports content, as no new negative factors (such as foreign currency impacts or rights reductions) are mentioned for 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, International Networks Revenue increased due to higher revenue from sports network distribution, reaching $4,109 million.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, International Networks Revenue further increased to $4,282 million, as shown in the financial table, though no specific drivers are detailed in the evidence.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The revenue from International Networks increased moderately between 2023 and 2024, indicating sustained performance, especially considering the absence of any negative impacts in 2024, unlike 2022 which had currency and rights-related challenges."

      "answer": "In 2023, Domestic Distribution Revenue increased primarily due to growth in Peacock paid subscribers, which offset a decline in revenue from traditional networks caused by a drop in subscribers. Excluding the impact of the Beijing Olympics in 2022, the trend remained consistent with Peacock driving growth. In 2024, Domestic Distribution Revenue reached $11,826 million, up from $10,663 million in 2023. This reflects continued growth in Peacock's influence, as Peacock's paid subscribers increased to 31 million in 2023 from 21 million in 2022, suggesting sustained momentum into 2024. Meanwhile, traditional networks continued to face subscriber declines, though contractual rate increases helped mitigate some revenue loss. Thus, the evolution shows a transformation in Domestic Distribution Revenue composition, with Peacock becoming a more dominant contributor.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Domestic Distribution Revenue increased due to Peacock subscriber growth, despite declines in traditional network revenue driven by subscriber losses.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Domestic Distribution Revenue rose to $11,826 million from $10,663 million in 2023, indicating continued growth likely driven by Peacock's expanding subscriber base.",
        "Step 3: The shift in composition reflects a transformation where Peacock's role expanded, while traditional networks saw ongoing subscriber declines, though partially offset by rate increases."

This represents a significant increase in the reported expense magnitude and a transformation in the level of transparency and segmentation of these costs. The change indicates a strategic shift toward more detailed financial disclosure, particularly for operational expenses.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Operations and Support Expenses were reported at $49,604 million without segment-level detail.",

        "Step 3: The transformation from a single company-wide figure in 2023 to detailed segment-level reporting in 2024 indicates a significant increase in expense magnitude and a notable evolution in financial transparency."

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T added 1.1 million fiber customers, bringing its total fiber consumer wireline broadband customers to 8.3 million by year-end. This growth underscored the success of its fiber expansion strategy and reinforced the importance of fiber in its network infrastructure. In 2024, AT&T explicitly linked this fiber growth to its strategic focus on integrating wireless and fiber services, emphasizing its multi-gig rollout launched in January 2022, which offers symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers to Fiber customers. The company stated its intention to continue developing unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions, showing that the prior year's fiber customer gains directly informed its decision to deepen convergence between wireless and fiber offerings. This indicates that the 2023 fiber customer growth validated the investment in fiber and justified the 2024 strategic pivot toward integrated services.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Dollars in millions ex cept per share amounts\n\nWireless We expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video and data usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nex t-generation integrated services that combine technologies and services. As of December 31, 2024, we served 141 million wireless subscribers in North America, with 118 million in the United States.\n\nOur LTE technology covers over 440 million people in North America, and in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 336 million people. When combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. In December 2018, we introduced the nation's first commercial mobile 5G service and expanded that deployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31, 2024, our network covers more than 314 million people with 5G technology in the United States and North America.\n\nOur networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies' networks. We believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31, 2024, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million people in Mexico.\n\nIntegration of Wireless and Fiber Services The communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of converging the offering of wireline and wireless services. As the owner and operator of scaled wireless and fiber networks, we plan to continue to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and providing broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service. In January 2022, we launched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to AT&amp;T Fiber customers in select locations with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers. We intend to continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions.\n\n## REGULATORY LANDSCAPE\n\nAT&amp;T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. While these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words 'we,' 'AT&amp;T' and 'our' are used to simplify the discussion. The following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues.\n\n## International Regulation\n\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) services globally and wireless services in Mexico.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in May of 2018. This regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance. AT&amp;T processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees.\n\n## U.S. Regulation\n\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC's regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further ex tended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition. We have organized the following discussion by service impacted.\n\nInternet Until 2015, the FCC classified fix ed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as information services subject to minimal regulation. In 2015, the FCC reclassified such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC and imposed 'net neutrality rules.' Since then, the FCC has twice reversed course, most recently again reclassifying such services as telecommunications services subject to broader regulation by the FCC in an order adopted on April 25, 2024. Multiple trade associations and other parties challenged the FCC's reclassification decision in appeals consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The trade associations petitioned the Six th Circuit to stay the FCC's order. On August 1, 2024, the Six th Circuit issued a stay of the FCC order pending review of the appeals, holding that broadband providers are likely to succeed on the merits. On January 2, 2025, the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting the petition for review and setting aside the FCC net neutrality order, holding that broadband internet access service is an information service.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Services emphasized heavy investment in hardware such as smartphones, home devices, and wearables, acknowledging the intense competition and rapid product life cycles in this market. The focus was also on expanding Google Cloud and Other Bets, with concerns about potential lower margins and risks associated with these ventures. By 2023, the strategic focus had evolved significantly, with a stronger emphasis on AI integration across core services and products. Google introduced AI-powered tools like Performance Max and Product Studio to enhance advertising capabilities, while also embedding AI into Pixel devices (e.g., Best Take, Magic Editor) and planning AI-forward versions of Android and Chrome. This shift indicates a transformation from hardware-centric investment to AI-driven innovation across both services and devices.",

The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have  adequate  patent  or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.",

In the 2023 10-K filing, the company again disclosed changes in cost-per-click, but this time for the period from 2022 to 2023, and placed it within a broader monetization metrics framework that included paid clicks and impressions.

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T reported that Operations and Support Expenses increased due to foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by lower expenses, with approximately 7% of Mexico expenses being U.S. dollar-based. By 2024, the Operations and Support Expenses for the Mobility segment were $48,724 million on $85,255 million in revenue, for Business Wireline they were $13,352 million on $18,819 million in revenue, and for Latin America - Mexico they were $3,535 million on $4,232 million in revenue. This indicates that while expenses were still influenced by foreign exchange in 2022, by 2024, expense ratios relative to revenue had decreased in Mobility and Latin America - Mexico, suggesting improved cost efficiency, but increased in Business Wireline, showing divergent trends across segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Operations and Support Expenses increased primarily due to foreign exchange impacts, particularly in Mexico, where 93% of expenses were in local currency.",

        "Step 3: The change shows a shift from a general explanation of expense increases in 2022 to a more granular view in 2024, with varying efficiency trends across business segments, indicating strategic or operational adjustments."

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T's Operations and Support Expenses decreased, primarily due to business divestitures (such as the U.S. video and Vrio businesses), lower bad debt expense, and reduced personnel costs from transformation initiatives. By 2024, these expenses had increased, with the total amount reaching $80,190 million, as disclosed in the 2024 segment reporting. This indicates a shift in operational cost strategy: while divestitures initially led to cost reductions, the subsequent rise in expenses suggests a reinvestment phase, potentially in core operations such as wireless equipment and WarnerMedia programming. This evolution reflects a strategic realignment following earlier restructuring efforts.",

          "chunk_text": "## OVERVIEW\n\nOperating revenues decreased in 2021, with declines reflecting our July 31, 2021 separation of the U.S. video business, the completion of the sale of our Vrio business unit in November 2021 and the October 2020 sale of wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Also contributing to revenue declines was lower Business Wireline revenues due in part to higher demand for pandemic-related connectivity in the prior year. Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobility equipment and service revenues and gains in broadband service in our Communications segment; higher content and DTC subscription revenues in our WarnerMedia segment; and growth in Mexico wireless operations including favorable foreign exchange impacts.\n\nOperations and support expenses decreased in 2021, with declines reflecting our business divestitures, lower bad debt expense and lower personnel costs associated with our ongoing transformation initiatives. Declines were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher volumes, and higher WarnerMedia programming costs and marketing activities.\n\nAsset impairments and abandonments decreased in 2021, with higher impairments in 2020. Noncash impairment charges in 2020 included $15,508, resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the long-lived assets and goodwill associated with our U.S. video business (see Notes 7 and 9); $2,212 goodwill impairment at our Vrio business unit (see Note 9); and $780 from the impairment of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, with approximately $524 resulting from the continued shutdown of theaters during the pandemic and the hybrid distribution model for our 2021 film slate (see Note 11). In 2021, we took an additional Vrio impairment of $4,555, resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the net assets of Vrio (see Note 6).\n\n## Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2021.\n\nAmortization expense decreased $3,779, or 47.2%, in 2021, primarily due to ceasing amortization on Video and Vrio held-for-sale assets.\n\nDepreciation expense decreased $1,875, or 9.1%, in 2021, primarily due to the lower cost basis of property, plant and equipment resulting from Video impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 and ceasing depreciation on Video and Vrio held-for-sale assets in 2021.\n\nOperating income increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. Our operating margin was 13.8% in 2021, compared to 3.7% in 2020 and 15.4% in 2019.\n\nInterest expense decreased in 2021, primarily due to lower interest rates and capitalized interest associated with the spectrum acquisitions, partially offset by higher debt balances.\n\nEquity in net income (loss) of affiliates increased in 2021, primarily due to the close of our transaction with TPG related to the U.S. video business, which resulted in our accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting beginning August 1, 2021 (see Notes 6 and 20).\n\nOther income (expense) - net increased in 2021, primarily due to the recognition of $4,140 in actuarial gains, compared to losses of $4,169 in 2020, and recognition of $1,405 of debt redemption costs in 2020. Also contributing to increased income were higher net pension and postretirement benefit credits from higher prior service credit amortization (see Note 15) and net gains on the sale of assets (see Note 6).\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2021, primarily driven by increased income before income taxes, offset primarily by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) benefit of U.S. federal Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryback and benefits on divestitures in 2021.\n\nOur effective tax rate was 20.3% in 2021, (33.8)% in 2020, and 18.9% in 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by our impairment of Vrio and Video goodwill, which was not deductible for tax purposes.",
