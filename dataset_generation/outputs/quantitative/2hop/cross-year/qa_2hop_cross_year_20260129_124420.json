By 2023, average daily package volume had decreased by 8.2%, from 24,291 thousand in 2022 to 22,290 thousand in 2023.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

      "question": "How did the composition and magnitude of 'Other Deductions, Net' evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what specific components contributed to the change?",
      "answer": "In 2023, 'Other Deductions, Net' were $506 million, primarily driven by higher intangibles amortization of $146 million related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 million. By 2024, this figure increased significantly to $1,434 million, reflecting a rise in intangibles amortization to $560 million due to the Test & Measurement acquisition, a $156 million increase in restructuring costs, and a $48 million divestiture loss. This indicates a transformation in the nature and scale of deductions, shifting from foreign exchange and amortization effects to acquisition/divestiture-related charges and restructuring.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - Other Deductions, Net were $506 million, driven by intangibles amortization and foreign currency losses.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - Other Deductions, Net increased to $1,434 million, with significant contributions from acquisition-related amortization, restructuring, and divestiture losses.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change type is 'transformed' as the primary contributors shifted from foreign exchange and amortization from a past acquisition to new acquisition/divestiture impacts and restructuring, with a 'significant' magnitude due to the large increase in total deductions."

      "question": "How did the impact of profit booking rate adjustments on segment operating profit evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's contract performance and risk management during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion, reflecting favorable changes in estimated total costs or variable consideration on contracts. In 2024, while the company continued to disclose the importance of profit booking rates, it emphasized a more cautious approach, noting that profit booking rates may increase during contract performance if risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects are successfully retired. This indicates a shift from realized gains in 2023 to a more risk-adjusted and forward-looking approach in 2024, suggesting increased focus on managing uncertainties in contract execution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company explicitly reported that profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by $1.6 billion, indicating a favorable impact from revisions in cost or revenue estimates.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company described how profit booking rates are influenced by the successful retirement of risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects, signaling a more forward-looking and risk-sensitive approach.",
        "Step 3: The change from a realized financial benefit in 2023 to a more strategic, risk-adjusted explanation in 2024 reflects an evolution in how profit booking rates are being managed and communicated, suggesting increased emphasis on risk mitigation in contract performance."

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  in  which  control  does  not  continuously  transfer  to  the  customer,  we  recognize  revenue  at  the  point  in  time  in  which  each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fix ed-pricedincentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2024, our ending backlog was $176.0 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 35% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. G overnment and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the U.S. G overnment provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. Typical payment terms under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S G overnment provide for billing of allowable costs incurred plus applicable fee on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to  adequately  complete  some  or  all  of  the  obligations  under  the  contract.  Payments  received  from  customers  in  advance  of  revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fix ed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial  profit  booking  rate  of  each  contract  considers  risks  surrounding  the  ability  to  achieve  the  technical  requirements,  schedule  and  costs  in  the  initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the",

      "answer": "In 2023, profit booking rates were described as being significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions, particularly in relation to the risks surrounding technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts. The document emphasized that changes in these estimates could affect the profit booking rate and that comparability of segment sales and operating profit could be influenced by favorable or unfavorable items, including changes in estimates. By 2024, the discussion evolved to focus on how profit booking rates were more directly tied to the initial risk assessment of contracts, with an emphasis on how successfully retiring risks (technical, schedule, and cost-related) could lead to an increase in profit booking rates during contract execution. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more structured view of backlog conversion, noting that $176.0 billion in backlog was expected to convert into revenue over 12\u201324 months, with profit booking rates being influenced by the successful mitigation of risks over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the profit booking rate was described as being sensitive to changes in estimates and assumptions, with a focus on how these changes could affect revenue recognition and segment profitability.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the discussion shifted to a more structured view of how profit booking rates were initially set based on risk and how they could increase if risks were retired during contract execution, with specific mention of backlog conversion and risk-based adjustments.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a shift from a general sensitivity to estimates (2023) to a more dynamic model where profit booking rates are actively adjusted based on risk mitigation (2024)."

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  in  which  control  does  not  continuously  transfer  to  the  customer,  we  recognize  revenue  at  the  point  in  time  in  which  each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fix ed-pricedincentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2024, our ending backlog was $176.0 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 35% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. G overnment and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the U.S. G overnment provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. Typical payment terms under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S G overnment provide for billing of allowable costs incurred plus applicable fee on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to  adequately  complete  some  or  all  of  the  obligations  under  the  contract.  Payments  received  from  customers  in  advance  of  revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fix ed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial  profit  booking  rate  of  each  contract  considers  risks  surrounding  the  ability  to  achieve  the  technical  requirements,  schedule  and  costs  in  the  initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the",

By 2023, the healthcare business had already been separated into GE HealthCare through a spin-off, and the company was actively preparing for the separation of GE Vernova, which includes Renewable Energy and Power businesses. The 2023 disclosures indicate that the separation plan was progressing with specific expectations around tax treatment, regulatory approvals, and capital structure, showing a shift from a conceptual plan in 2022 to an actionable and partially executed strategy in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.\n\nUnder the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 11.5% to 20.5%.\n\nEstimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\nINSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 11 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 12 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of U.S. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. At December 31, 2021, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but we reassess this on an ongoing basis. In December 2021, the Company announced plans to form three public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy. Planning for and execution of this separation will result in tax including potentially tax on changes in indefinite reinvestment outside the U.S. The impact of a change in reinvestment will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. Amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of this, $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 14 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.

      "answer": "In 2022, Level 3 securities included $745 million of Mortgage and asset-backed debt securities, and valuation relied primarily on non-binding broker quotes or third-party sources with unobservable inputs. By 2023, the amount of Mortgage and asset-backed debt securities had decreased to $177 million, while U.S. corporate debt securities increased to $379 million. The valuation methodology remained consistent in citing non-binding broker quotes, but the composition of the securities portfolio shifted significantly, indicating a strategic reduction in mortgage and asset-backed exposure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE's Corporate operating profit was negatively impacted by a $12.5 billion decrease in gains on purchases and sales of business interests, primarily due to the absence of a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment.

Corporate operating profit decreased by $6.3 billion due to $12.5 billion of lower gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our BioPharma business in 2020. This decrease was partially offset by a $3.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to $2.9 billion and $0.7 billion of mark-to-market activity on our Baker Hughes and AerCap shares respectively. In addition, Corporate operating profit increased due to lower restructuring and other charges primarily at Aviation and Corporate, partially offset by Power, and nonrecurrence of non-cash impairment charges and settlement of the SEC investigation in 2020, and higher income in our run-off Insurance business primarily driven by strong investment results and lower claims.\n\nAdjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.4 billion primarily as the result of $0.5 billion of cost reductions in our Corporate functions. In addition, corporate cost decreased by $0.2 billion as the result of lower intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our Renewable Energy segment, lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by higher spare engine sales from our Aviation segment to our GECAS business before its combination with AerCap in November 2021. These decreases were partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher costs associated with EHS and other items.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 , revenues decreased by $0.9 billion, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion decrease in revenues due to the sale of our Current and Lighting businesses in April 2019 and June 2020, respectively, $0.5 billion of higher intersegment eliminations, partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher revenue in our run-off Insurance business. Corporate operating profit increased by $11.2 billion due to $12.6 billion of higher gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our BioPharma business in 2020, partially offset by a $2.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to mark-to-market activity on our Baker Hughes shares. Corporate operating profit also increased due to lower restructuring and other charges, primarily at Corporate and Power, partially offset by higher charges at Aviation, lower non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by $0.2 billion for the settlement of the SEC investigation in 2020. In addition, Corporate profit increased by $1.0 billion due to the nonrecurrence of $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through our annual insurance premium deficiency review in our run-off Insurance business in 2019.\n\nAdjusted total corporate operating costs* remained relatively flat in 2020 due to $0.2 billion of lower EHS and other items, $0.3 billion of cost reductions in our Digital business and Corporate functions, offset by $0.4 billion of higher costs in our GE Capital businesses primarily due to lower gains from the sale of equity method investments at EFS, higher marks and volume decline. Overall, eliminations were relatively flat due to higher intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our Renewable Energy segment, higher intersegment eliminations, offset by lower spare engine sales from our Aviation segment to our previously owned GECAS business.\n\n## OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION\n\nRESTRUCTURING. This table is inclusive of all restructuring charges in our segments and at Corporate, and the charges are shown below for the business where they originated. Separately, in our reported segment results, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate (see the Corporate section).\n\n",

By 2023, GE had completed the spin-off of GE Healthcare in January 2023 and planned to spin off GE Vernova, subject to regulatory approvals and tax rulings. The 2023 disclosures also highlighted potential non-U.S. cash taxes and non-cash tax expenses, including possible impairments of deferred tax assets, which were not explicitly detailed in 2022.

          "chunk_text": "Cash held in non-U.S. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to U.S. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. Any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. With regards to our announcement to form three public companies, we expect that planning for and execution of this separation will impact indefinite reinvestment. The impact of that change will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2021 included $2.0 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions and $0.3 billion of restricted use cash. Cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the U.S. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial costs. Restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. Excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.4 billion of cash in our run-off Insurance business, which was classified as All other assets in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nIn connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our Baker Hughes position over approximately three years, we received total proceeds of $4.1 billion in 2021, including $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, we received $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time.\n\nWe provided capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarters of 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024, including approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. These contributions are subject to ongoing monitoring by the Kansas Insurance Department (KID), and the total amount to be contributed could increase or decrease, or the timing could be accelerated, based upon the results of reserve adequacy testing or a decision by KID to modify the schedule of contributions set forth in January 2018. We are required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements.\n\nBORROWINGS. Consolidated total borrowings were $35.2 billion and $74.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, a decrease of $39.7 billion. The reduction in borrowings was driven by debt repurchases of $32.6 billion, net repayments and maturities of debt of $4.6 billion, $1.7 billion of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships, and $0.8 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates and other amortization.\n\nWe have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $14.4 billion at December 31, 2021, comprised of a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of $4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.\n\nLiability Management Actions . During 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 10 for further information.\n\nCREDIT RATINGS AND CONDITIONS. We have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&amp;P), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. As a result of our transition to one-column financial statement reporting in the fourth quarter of 2021, we are now presenting our credit ratings on a consolidated basis for the Company. Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",

        "Step 3: The reduced focus on defined benefit plans implies a strategic move away from long-term salary-linked liabilities, indicating a shift in compensation philosophy toward defined contributions, which do not depend on future salary increases."

          "chunk_text": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FedEx Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in common stockholders' investment for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated July 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Pension Projected Benefit Obligation\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt May 31, 2022, the Company's aggregated projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $28.7 billion and exceeded the $26.0 billion fair value of U.S. pension plan assets, resulting in an unfunded U.S. pension obligation of $2.7 billion. The net periodic benefit cost for the year ended May 31, 2022 for the U.S. pension plans was $1.6 billion. As explained in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain U.S. employees. The Company's projected benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans is measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for discount rate, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages.\n\nAuditing the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was complex due to the highly judgmental nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit the concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to exclude bonds with a call feature unless they have a low probability of being called.",

Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account ('PPA'). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.\n\nWe also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.\n\nThe U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit is a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health reimbursement account ('HRA') for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at retirement. Retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nPENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.\n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our plans are as follows:\n\n",

We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, and other fixed-income securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.\n- Alternative Investments . The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner.

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx had already closed its U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020, and introduced an enhanced 401(k) plan with a company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies. By 2024, this transition was further solidified, with the company continuing to emphasize the 401(k) structure and offering existing employees under the Portable Pension Account (PPA) formula a one-time option to either remain in the pension plan or move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated July 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Pension Projected Benefit Obligation\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt May 31, 2022, the Company's aggregated projected benefit obligation for U.S. pension plans was $28.7 billion and exceeded the $26.0 billion fair value of U.S. pension plan assets, resulting in an unfunded U.S. pension obligation of $2.7 billion. The net periodic benefit cost for the year ended May 31, 2022 for the U.S. pension plans was $1.6 billion. As explained in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain U.S. employees. The Company's projected benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans is measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for discount rate, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages.\n\nAuditing the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans was complex due to the highly judgmental nature and significant effect of the discount rate used in the measurement process. The discount rate is developed by utilizing the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds that match cash flows to benefit payments, limit the concentration by industry and issuer, and apply screening criteria to exclude bonds with a call feature unless they have a low probability of being called.",

Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account ('PPA'). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.\n\nWe also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.\n\nThe U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit is a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health reimbursement account ('HRA') for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at retirement. Retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nPENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.\n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our plans are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did FedEx's business realignment costs evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic workforce adjustments in Europe?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs related to the European workforce reduction plan tied to the TNT Express integration. By 2024, the company no longer incurred such costs, as the earlier plan was completed by 2023. However, in June 2024, FedEx announced a new workforce reduction plan in Europe with an expected pre-tax cost ranging from $250 million to $375 million in cash expenditures through fiscal 2026. This indicates a continuation of strategic workforce adjustments in Europe, shifting from integration-related restructuring to cost containment measures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs associated with a European workforce reduction plan linked to the TNT Express integration.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the company had completed the prior realignment program and did not incur any business realignment costs in that year, but announced a new workforce reduction plan with expected costs between $250 million and $375 million.",
        "Step 3: The shift from incurring costs in 2022 to planning new expenditures in 2024 indicates a transformation in the company's strategic approach to workforce adjustments in Europe, moving from integration to structural cost reduction."

          "chunk_text": "Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our selfinsured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In 2015, a jury awarded compensatory damages of approximately $160 million to plaintiffs in connection with a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit filed against FedEx Ground in New Mexico state court. The award was subsequently affirmed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals and ultimately by the New Mexico Supreme Court in May 2022. While our insurance carriers have funded the approximately $160 million base judgment in excess of FedEx Ground's $7.5 million self-insured retention and insurance deductible, we are currently pursuing insurance coverage for reimbursement of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. See Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report for more information. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities. Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. Additionally, the ICAO's standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. We are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as investments in fleet and facility modernization and strategic investments to increase collaboration and automation and improve productivity, network efficiencies, and safety. Additionally, we are executing initiatives to use data to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members, as well as to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. See 'Item 1. Business' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nSuch initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions. For example, in 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. If we are not able to successfully implement this plan, our future financial results may suffer.\n\nChanges in our business strategy may also expose us to new and heightened risks. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2020, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach. Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data within and among FedEx Dataworks, ShopRunner, and the other FedEx operating companies.",

One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Honeywell recognized repositioning charges totaling $860 million, whereas in 2024, the charges decreased significantly to $244 million. This indicates a substantial reduction in restructuring activity year-over-year, suggesting that the company's transformation initiatives may have stabilized or entered a new phase with fewer associated costs.",

        "Step 1: Identify the repositioning charges in 2023, which totaled $860 million as disclosed in the cash flow statement.",

      "question": "How did Honeywell's disclosure regarding asbestos-related liabilities evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of the methodology used for estimating future claims and the uncertainties surrounding insurance recoveries?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Honeywell used a defined look-back period and epidemiological projections through 2059 to estimate future asbestos-related liabilities and considered insurer solvency in calculating probable recoveries.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company provided a more generalized disclosure, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation and contingent liabilities without referencing the same detailed actuarial methodology or insurance recovery projections.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a quantitatively descriptive and methodologically transparent approach in 2023 to a more qualitative and uncertainty-focused disclosure in 2024, indicating a transformation in how the company communicates risk around asbestos liabilities."

Within our International package segment, challenging macroeconomic conditions led to a slight volume decline.\n\n- Revenue was relatively flat for the year. Within our U.S. Domestic Package segment, revenue growth was attributable to air cargo and overall volume growth, but was largely offset by unfavorable shifts in product mix and declines in fuel surcharge revenue. In our International Package segment, revenue benefited from growth in our export products and increases in revenue per piece for our domestic products. Revenue in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses declined primarily as a result of the September 2024 divestiture of Coyote, with the decline partially offset by growth in Logistics and our other businesses.\n- Operating expenses increased for the year, primarily due to increased compensation expense in our U.S. Domestic Package segment as a result of higher wage rates paid to our Teamster employees. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the costs of operating our integrated air and ground network, benefits from our Fit to Serve initiative, as well as a gain related to the divestiture of Coyote.\n- Operating profit and operating margin decreased for the year as revenue increases only partly offset the operating expense increases.\n- Net income was $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $6.75 for the year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.72 for the year after adjusting for the after-tax  impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of Coyote of $152 million or $0.18 per diluted share;\n- a payment, including interest, to settle a one-time international regulatory matter of $94 million, or $0.11 per diluted share;\n- non-cash asset impairment charges of $81 million, or $0.09 per diluted share;\n- total transformation strategy costs of $245 million, or $0.29 per diluted share;\n- a charge related to a regulatory matter unrelated to our ongoing operations of $45 million, or $0.05 per diluted share;\n- an expense to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan of $14 million, or $0.02 per diluted share; and\n- defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plan mark-to-market loss outside of a 10% corridor of $506 million, or $0.59 per diluted share.\n\nFor additional operational results for the quarter and year-to-date periods specific to our segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain Solutions refer to the respective segment discussions below.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS reported Total Transformation Strategy Costs of $118 million, primarily driven by increases in Forwarding ($68 million) and Logistics ($48 million). By 2024, these costs decreased to $77 million, with Transformation 2.0 initiatives such as 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Financial Systems' accounting for $47 million in 2023 and $20 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic shift from broader transformation efforts to more targeted efficiency and network optimization initiatives like 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined' in 2024.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - UPS incurred $118 million in Total Transformation Strategy Costs, with Forwarding and Logistics being the main contributors.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - There was a significant decrease in transformation costs, indicating a shift from broad transformation efforts to more focused efficiency and network optimization strategies."

In 2024, these costs decreased to $245 million, with no specific Compensation costs reported and a significantly lower amount for Benefits.

Within our International package segment, challenging macroeconomic conditions led to a slight volume decline.\n\n- Revenue was relatively flat for the year. Within our U.S. Domestic Package segment, revenue growth was attributable to air cargo and overall volume growth, but was largely offset by unfavorable shifts in product mix and declines in fuel surcharge revenue. In our International Package segment, revenue benefited from growth in our export products and increases in revenue per piece for our domestic products. Revenue in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses declined primarily as a result of the September 2024 divestiture of Coyote, with the decline partially offset by growth in Logistics and our other businesses.\n- Operating expenses increased for the year, primarily due to increased compensation expense in our U.S. Domestic Package segment as a result of higher wage rates paid to our Teamster employees. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the costs of operating our integrated air and ground network, benefits from our Fit to Serve initiative, as well as a gain related to the divestiture of Coyote.\n- Operating profit and operating margin decreased for the year as revenue increases only partly offset the operating expense increases.\n- Net income was $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $6.75 for the year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.72 for the year after adjusting for the after-tax  impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of Coyote of $152 million or $0.18 per diluted share;\n- a payment, including interest, to settle a one-time international regulatory matter of $94 million, or $0.11 per diluted share;\n- non-cash asset impairment charges of $81 million, or $0.09 per diluted share;\n- total transformation strategy costs of $245 million, or $0.29 per diluted share;\n- a charge related to a regulatory matter unrelated to our ongoing operations of $45 million, or $0.05 per diluted share;\n- an expense to withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan of $14 million, or $0.02 per diluted share; and\n- defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plan mark-to-market loss outside of a 10% corridor of $506 million, or $0.59 per diluted share.\n\nFor additional operational results for the quarter and year-to-date periods specific to our segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain Solutions refer to the respective segment discussions below.",

However, in 2024, the segment experienced a 9% decrease in revenue, dropping to $12,389 million from $13,583 million in the prior year. This shift from growth to decline indicates a negative trend in the segment's performance over the two-year period.",

      "question": "How has Boeing's financial exposure and liquidity position related to its Commercial Airplanes segment evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of operating cash flow challenges and backlog value?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment was under significant financial strain, with $3.4 billion in net cash used by operating activities in 2021, $58.1 billion in debt, and expectations of continued negative cash flows until deliveries increased.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment showed signs of recovery with a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating improved order stability and potential for increased future cash flows.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a moderate transformation in Boeing\u2019s liquidity and exposure to the Commercial Airplanes segment, with financial pressures easing but not yet returning to pre-2020 levels."

These statements include the accounts of all  majority-owned  subsidiaries  and  variable  interest  entities  that  are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 22, we operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing Capital (BCC).\n\n## Liquidity Matters\n\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX  grounding  continue  to  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on  our  business  and  are  expected  to  continue  to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for our customers, our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. We continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to longterm trend growth. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\nDuring 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. Our operating cash flows continue to be impacted by lower commercial airplane deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers. We expect negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramp up. In 2021, we issued $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2026. We used the net proceeds of these note issuances to repay the $13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement. In 2021, we also repaid $1.5 billion of term notes. As a result,  our  cash  and  short-term  investment  balance  was  $16.2  billion  and  our  debt  balance  was  $58.1  billion  at December 31, 2021. In addition, we have term notes of $1.2 billion maturing in 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements is $14.7 billion. We anticipate that  these  revolving  credit  lines  will  remain  undrawn  and  primarily  serve  as  backup  liquidity  to  support  our  general corporate borrowing needs. Our borrowing capacity includes a $3.1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2022. See Note 15.\n\nIn  2021,  our  short-term  and  long-term  credit  ratings  by  the  major  credit  rating  agencies  remained  unchanged  from 2020. There is risk for further downgrades.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade payables included $2.3 billion and $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. While access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do not believe that these or future changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nIn addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During 2020, our Board of Directors  terminated  its  prior  authorization  to  repurchase  shares  of  the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock  and suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further",

There is risk for further downgrades.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade payables included $2.3 billion and $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. While access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do not believe that these or future changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nIn addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During 2020, our Board of Directors  terminated  its  prior  authorization  to  repurchase  shares  of  the  Company's  outstanding  common  stock  and suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until further",

We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. G ains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax  adjustments, which we ex pect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital's product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\n\n## U.S. Budget E nvironment\n\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. G overnment, U.S. G overnment spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\n\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Y ear (FY ) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\n\nThe  President's  FY   2025  budget  request  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  March  11,  2024,  initiating  the  FY   2025  defense  authorization  and  appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY  2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\n\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY  2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y ear 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY  2025 President's Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\n\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President's FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY  2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY  2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. G overnment operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding.

We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate  the  approximate  average  yields  on  corporate  bonds  rated AA  or  better  selected  to  match  our  projected  postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe  utilized  an  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  of  6.50%  at  December  31,  2021  compared  to  7.00%  at December 31, 2020. We lowered our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets due to changes in our asset allocation targets. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2021 of $3.9 billion, based on an actual rate of approximately  10.5%,  improved  plan  assets  more  than  the  $2.1  billion  expected  return  based  on  our  long-term  rate  of  return assumption.\n\nIn October 2021, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised  assumptions  in  our  December  31,  2021  re-measurement  of  benefit  obligation  resulting  in  an  approximate  $109  million increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\nOur stockholders' equity has been reduced cumulatively by $11.0 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized  to  the  extent  they  exceed  10%  of  the  greater  of  plan  assets  or  benefit  obligations,  over  an  average  period  of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2021. During 2021, $1.8 billion of these amounts were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 2.875% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2021, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2021 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 2.875% discount rate at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $10 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis  points  higher  or  lower,  with  all  other  assumptions  held  constant,  the  amount  of  FAS  pension  expense  projected  for  2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $75 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year's FAS expense. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2021 between our actual rate of return of approximately 10.5% and our expected long-term rate of return decreased (increased) 2022 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $15 million.\n\n## Funding Considerations\n\nWe made no contributions in 2021, compared to $1.0 billion in 2020, to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with ERISA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 92% and 82% as of",

Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. The funded status under ERISA is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. Our goal has been to fund each of our qualified defined benefit pension plans to a level of at least 80% as determined in accordance with ERISA; which may require the use of different assumptions, such as the discount rate and longevity, than used under GAAP. All of our qualified defined benefit pension plans had an ERISA funded status of at least 80% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. G overnment contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS rules govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. G overnment, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.\n\nWe recovered $1.7 billion  in  both  2024  and  2023  as  CAS  pension  costs. Amounts  contributed  in  excess  of  the  CAS  pension  costs  recovered  under  U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the ex tent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more  judgmental  due  to,  for  ex ample,  changing  remediation  technologies.  To  determine  the  costs  related  to  clean  up  sites,  we  have  to  assess  the  ex tent  of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standards.\n\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been  incurred  and  the  amounts  can  be  reasonably  estimated  (see  the  discussion  under  'Environmental  Matters'  in  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  and  'Note  14  -  Legal  Proceedings,  Commitments  and  Contingencies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements).  We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. G iven the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g. , a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the ex tent of contamination).\n\nUnder agreements reached with the U.S. G overnment, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. G overnment regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. G overnment business, after deducting  any  recoveries  received  from  insurance  or  other  PRPs,  are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  of  our  products  and  services. As  a  result,  most  of  the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. G overnment agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. G overnment regulations, our U.S. G overnment business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\n\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that profit booking rates could either increase or decrease based on changes in estimated total costs to complete contracts or changes in estimates of variable consideration, with such changes recognized in the period they were determined, reflecting inception-to-date effects. The document emphasized that increases (referred to as 'risk retirements') were typically linked to improved contract conditions, while deteriorations led to reductions in profit booking rates. By 2024, the company expanded on this by detailing how profit estimates are initially set considering risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts, and how successful risk mitigation could lead to lower estimated costs and thus higher profit booking rates. The 2024 disclosure also introduced a more structured view of backlog conversion, noting that $176.0 billion in ending backlog was expected to convert into revenue over 12\u201324 months, with profit booking rates still sensitive to risk evolution over time.

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  in  which  control  does  not  continuously  transfer  to  the  customer,  we  recognize  revenue  at  the  point  in  time  in  which  each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fix ed-pricedincentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2024, our ending backlog was $176.0 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 35% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. G overnment and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the U.S. G overnment provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. Typical payment terms under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S G overnment provide for billing of allowable costs incurred plus applicable fee on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to  adequately  complete  some  or  all  of  the  obligations  under  the  contract.  Payments  received  from  customers  in  advance  of  revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fix ed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial  profit  booking  rate  of  each  contract  considers  risks  surrounding  the  ability  to  achieve  the  technical  requirements,  schedule  and  costs  in  the  initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  Item  8  -  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nThe MD&amp;A generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019  items  and  year-to-year  comparisons  between  2020  and  2019  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations' in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on January 28, 2021.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nWe  are  a  global  security  and  aerospace  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering,  technical,  scientific,  logistics,  system  integration  and  cybersecurity  services.  We  serve  both  U.S.  and  international customers with products and services that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal  customers  being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.\n\nWe operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S.  and  international  customers  at  affordable  prices.  Recognizing  that  our  customers  are  resource  constrained,  we  place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner,  with  a  focus  on  adjacent  markets  close  to  our  core  capabilities  as  well  as  growing  our  international  sales.  We  invest substantially  in  our  people  to  ensure  we  have  the  technical  skills  necessary  to  succeed,  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest  in  acquisitions,  as  appropriate,  while  deepening  our  connection  to  commercial  industry  through  cooperative  partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to present business challenges in 2021. We experienced impacts in each of our business areas  related  to  COVID-19,  primarily  in  continued  increased  coronavirus-related  costs,  delays  in  supplier  deliveries,  travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, employee absences, remote work and adjusted work schedules. During the first half  of  2021,  we  had  initiated  a  plan  to  reintroduce  employees  that  had  been  working  remotely  to  the  workplace,  however,  we paused the reintroduction as COVID-19 cases rose in the second half of 2021. Attendance for employees required to be onsite has fluctuated based on pandemic developments. We continued to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including  encouraging  employees  to  be  vaccinated.  We  also  continued  to  work  with  our  customers  and  suppliers  to  minimize disruptions, including using accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and cash on hand to accelerate $2.2 billion of payments to our suppliers as of December 31, 2021 that are due by their terms in future periods. We will continue to monitor risk driven by the pandemic and, based on our current assessment, we expect to continue to accelerate payments to our suppliers based on risk  assessed  need  through  the  end  of  2022.  Consistent  with  our  current  acceleration  approach,  we  will  prioritize  small  and COVID-19 impacted businesses.\n\nWe  are  closely  tracking  developments  regarding  vaccine  mandates.  Currently,  all  personnel  working  at  DoD  facilities, including  Lockheed  Martin  employees,  must  comply  with  DoD's  process  to  attest  to  vaccination  status.  Pursuant  to  the  DoD mandate,  this  is  required  for  physical  access  to  DoD  buildings  and  leased  spaces  in  non-DoD  buildings  where  official  agency business is performed. Additionally, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021, pursuant to Executive Order 14042, referred  to  as  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate,  all  U.S.  based  employees  of  Lockheed  Martin  and  most  of  its  suppliers, industry partners and contractors working directly or indirectly on covered government contracts, or working at a facility where those contracts are performed, administered, or otherwise supported, were to be fully vaccinated, or have an",

We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. G ains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax  adjustments, which we ex pect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital's product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\n\n## U.S. Budget E nvironment\n\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. G overnment, U.S. G overnment spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\n\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Y ear (FY ) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\n\nThe  President's  FY   2025  budget  request  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  March  11,  2024,  initiating  the  FY   2025  defense  authorization  and  appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY  2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\n\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY  2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y ear 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY  2025 President's Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\n\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President's FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY  2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY  2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. G overnment operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding.

Excludes casual workers, interns/co-ops and employees of certain subsidiaries and joint ventures. (a)\n\n(b) Executive is defined as director-level (one level below vice president) or higher.\n\n## Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development\n\nWe strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. During 2021, we hired more than 10,000 employees, despite the  continuing  challenges  presented  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic. An  integral  part  of  our  people  strategy  is  early  career  hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields. In addition to efforts focused on recruitment, we also monitor employee attrition across a broad array of categories and segments of the population, including with respect to diversity and top talent.  Critical  to  attracting  and  retaining  top  talent  is  employee  satisfaction,  and  we  regularly  conduct  employee  engagement surveys  to  gauge  employee  satisfaction  and  to  understand  the  effectiveness  of  our  people  strategy.  We  attract  and  reward  our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to nonrepresented employees of all levels in our organization and encourage excellence through our pay-for-performance philosophy. We also have continued a teleworking policy that encourages flexible working arrangements for employees who can meet  our  customer  commitments  remotely,  which  we  believe  helps  recruit  and  retain  talent.  In  addition,  we  invest  in  the development  of  our  employees  through  training,  apprenticeship  programs,  leadership  development  plans  and  offering  tuition assistance  programs  for  continuing  education  or  industry  certifications.  This  employee  development  helps  to  make  us  more competitive and also assists with leadership succession planning throughout the corporation.\n\n## Employee Safety and Health\n\nOur safety  and  health  program  seeks  to  optimize  our  operations  through  targeted  safety,  health  and  wellness  opportunities designed to ensure safe work conditions, a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. As part of this program, we track employee health and safety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of  injury  and  illness  incidents  that  occur  at  work,  those  incidents  that  result  in  days  lost,  and  the  number  of  days  lost  due  to workplace injuries  and  illness.  During  2021,  these  metrics  continued  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  the  absence  from  work  and delays  in  the  return  to  work  related  to  COVID-19. We  continue  to  take  steps  to  protect  our  employees  from  COVID-19  while sustaining production and related services, including by establishing minimum staffing and social distancing and mask wearing policies  consistent  with  current  governmental  guidance,  cleaning  common  areas  more  frequently,  implementing  a  flexible teleworking  policy  for  employees  who  can  work  from  home,  encouraging  employee  vaccinations  while  monitoring  potential vaccine mandates, and instituting other measures designed to mitigate and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nFor information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur broad portfolio of products and services competes both domestically and internationally against products and services of other  large  aerospace  and  defense  companies,  numerous  smaller  competitors  and,  increasingly,  emerging  competitors,  including startups  and  non-traditional  defense  contractors.  Changes  within  the  industry  we  operate  in,  such  as  vertical  integration  by  our peers, could negatively impact us without appropriate remedies to protect our interests. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded competition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products  and  services  to  the  customer;  technical  and  management  capability;  the  ability  to  develop  and  implement  complex, integrated  system  architectures;  total  cost  of  ownership;  our  demonstrated  ability  to  execute  and  perform  against  contract requirements;  and  our  ability  to  provide  timely  and  cost  effective  solutions.  Technological  advances  in  such  areas  as  additive manufacturing,  data  analytics,  digital  engineering,  artificial  intelligence,  advanced  materials,  autonomy  and  robotics,  and  new business models such as commercial access to space are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.\n\nThe competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Raw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality\n\nSome of our products require relatively scarce raw materials, such as rare earth minerals. Other important materials and components, on which certain of our products rely, include aluminum, titanium, specialty steel, carbon fiber and advanced microelectronics, such as semiconductors. We rely on other companies to provide materials, components and products and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Although  long-term  agreements  have  historically  helped  enable  a  continued  supply  of  these  materials,  supply  chain  challenges,  supplier  disputes,  regulatory restrictions, and inflationary pressures have caused certain parts' shortages, extended lead times and pricing escalations affecting certain sources of supply. We are working with  U.S.  G overnment, customers and suppliers on phase-in of regulatory requirements for transitioning the supply chains for rare earth minerals and magnets to secure and compliant sources. The current availability of sources of supply meeting regulatory requirements and the ability to ensure compliance down to the mining level within the timeframes required by the regulations are challenges we continue to work with our multi-tier supplier base. At the same time, we are focused on minimizing the impact of these supply chain challenges on our programs. However, many of the challenges are industry wide or caused by geopolitical events and general economic conditions that are outside of our control. These supplier disruptions have resulted in delays and increased costs and have adversely affected our program performance and operating results. These dynamics are expected to continue in 2025. For more information on the risks related to our suppliers and raw materials, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. V arious factors, however, can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods, including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nDue  to  the  specialized  nature  of  our  business,  our  performance  depends  on  identifying,  attracting,  developing,  motivating  and  retaining  a  highly  skilled workforce with the requisite skills and, in many cases, security clearances, in multiple areas, including engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy, which we refer to as our people strategy, tightly aligns to our business needs and technology strategy and focused in 2024 on continuing to accelerate the transformation of our technology for workforce management through investments in upgraded systems and processes, increasing our ability to meet the quickly changing needs of our business, and maintaining a working environment and culture that is supportive of all employees and reflects our core value of 'Respect Others.' We structure our people strategy and its implementation to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject as a federal government contractor.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a highly skilled workforce made up of approximately 121,000 employees, including approximately 70,000 engineers, scientists and information technology professionals. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our workforce was located in the U.S. and approximately 19% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. Historically, we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee and union relations to be good. This has continued to be the case in 2024.\n\nWe strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. During 2024, we hired nearly 9,200 employees and we hired 3,900 college hires and interns during the 2023-24 academic year. An integral part of our people strategy is early career hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields and critical skills areas. We seek to access the broadest possible pool of talent to enable us to meet our hiring needs, and we work to expand Lockheed Martin's brand awareness and positioning as a best place to work.\n\nEmployee satisfaction is essential to attracting and retaining top talent, and we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and to  understand  the  effectiveness  of  our  people  strategy  and  assess  employees'  intent  to  stay.  We  attract  and  reward  our  employees  by  providing  market competitive compensation and benefits, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to non-represented employees of all levels in our organization and encourage excellence through our pay-for-performance philosophy. We have a hybrid workforce model that enables flexible working arrangements for employees and teams who can meet our customer commitments remotely, which has helped recruit and retain talent. In addition, we invest in the development of our employees through training, apprenticeship programs, security clearance sponsorship, leadership development plans and offering tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certifications. We believe this employee development makes us more competitive and assists with leadership succession planning throughout the company. In addition to efforts focused on recruitment and retention, we also monitor employee attrition across our employee population and take action based on the insights we gain from that monitoring process.",

      "question": "How did FedEx's capital allocation strategy regarding vehicles and trailers evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their investment priorities across different business units?",
      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx reported a decrease in capital expenditures on vehicles and trailers specifically at FedEx Freight, contributing to an overall $1.0 billion decline in capital spending. However, by 2024, the total value of vehicles and trailers in the company's property and equipment increased from $10,191 million to $10,568 million. This suggests that despite the initial pullback at FedEx Freight, the company increased investments in vehicles and trailers elsewhere, particularly at FedEx Express. This evolution indicates a reallocation of resources rather than an overall reduction in strategic importance of vehicle assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify capital expenditure trend in 2023, noting the decrease specifically in vehicles and trailers at FedEx Freight.",
        "Step 2: Examine the 2024 asset valuation for vehicles and trailers, showing an increase in total asset value company-wide.",
        "Step 3: Contrast the two years to determine that the reduction in spending in 2023 was unit-specific, while the 2024 figures indicate renewed investment, suggesting a strategic reallocation across business units."

      "answer": "In 2023, fuel surcharge revenues were $3.0 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion from $3.7 billion in 2022, primarily due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower shipment volumes, although fluctuating fuel prices had a delayed impact on recoveries. By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, fuel surcharge revenues were $3.0 billion, down from $3.7 billion in 2022, driven by a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower volume.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Union Pacific reported a $0.5 billion decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower locomotive diesel fuel prices, despite a 1% decrease in gross ton-miles and a slight deterioration in the fuel consumption rate. By 2024, gross ton-miles increased by 1%, reaching 847.4 billion, and locomotive productivity improved significantly, rising to 135 GTMs per horsepower day from 129 in 2023. This indicates that while 2023\u2019s fuel cost savings were driven mainly by lower fuel prices despite operational inefficiencies, 2024 saw improvements in locomotive productivity and volume, suggesting better fuel efficiency and operational performance.",

      "answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",

        "Step 3: The continued presence of these deductions in both years shows they remained a stable part of the company's tax planning, but the slight increase in the effective rate indicates a reduced relative benefit over time."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic investments in early stage companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating income, net in 2021 was $288 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $37 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for both 2021 and 2020. The rates for both 2021 and 2020 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the company's  defined  contribution  plans  with  an  employee  stock  ownership  plan  feature  and  tax  deductions  for  employee  equity awards.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with  retroactive  effect,  including  the  amortization  for  research  or  experimental  expenditures,  could  significantly  impact  our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. Recent  proposals  to  increase  the  U.S.  corporate  income  tax  rate  would  require  us  to  increase  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate  to  our  postretirement  benefit  plans.  In  addition  to  future  changes  in  tax  laws,  the  amount  of  net  deferred  tax  assets  will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress  may  defer,  modify,  or  repeal  this  provision,  potentially  with  retroactive  effect,  and  we  continue  to  have  ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this  provision  will  be  deferred,  modified,  or  repealed.  Furthermore,  in  anticipation  of  the  new  provision  taking  effect,  we  have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to evaluate its application to our business. If this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, we estimate it will decrease our expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. While the largest impact will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.\n\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  and  the  United  Kingdom).  The  final  determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\n\n## Net Earnings from Continuing Operations\n\nWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share)  in  2020.  Both  net  earnings  and  earnings  per  share  in  2021  were  affected  by  the  factors  mentioned  above,  including  the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company. Additionally,  both  net  earnings  and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment.  Earnings  per  share  also  benefited  from  a  net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  share  issuance  under  our  stock-based  awards  and  certain  defined contribution plans.\n\n## Net Loss from Discontinued Operations\n\nIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business divested in 2016.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

This $200 million decline indicates that the financial benefits from restructuring activities, such as severance and cost containment efforts, were lower in 2023 compared to the prior year.

We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for  awards  with  terms  that  specify  cliff  or  graded  vesting  and  contain  only  service  conditions.  Stock-based  compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis.\n\nBefore tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $200 million, $202 million and $205 million, respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $23 million, $34 million and $35 million, respectively.\n\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  there  was  $143  million  of  total  unrecognized  compensation  cost  from  stock-based  compensation arrangements  granted  under  the  plans,  which  is  related  to  non-vested  stock-based  awards.    We  expect  to  recognize  the compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\n\nWe currently use shares in Treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.\n\nThe cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $102 million, $108 million and $89 million, respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation.\n\n## 4.     Derivative financial instruments and risk management\n\nOur earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.  Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures.  Our policy specifies that derivatives are not  to  be  used  for  speculative  purposes.    Derivatives  that  we  use  are  primarily  foreign  currency  forward,  option  and  cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts.

Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:\n\n- The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $825 million is available to ME&amp;T) expires on September 1, 2022.\n- The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2021, of $2.73 billion (of which $715 million is available to ME&amp;T) expires in September 2024.\n- The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2021, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&amp;T) expires in September 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $16.58 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility.  The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.51 to 1.  This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility.\n\nIn addition, at December 31, 2021, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.25 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.91 to 1.  This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility.\n\nIn the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party  that  does  not  meet  its  covenants.  Additionally,  in  such  event,  certain  of  Cat  Financial's  other  lenders  under  other  loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.  At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\nOur total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2021 were:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When we make a sale to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment within  the  established  invoice  terms  to  avoid  potential  interest  costs.  Interest  at  or  above  prevailing  market  rates  may  be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In addition, Cat Financial provides wholesale inventory financing for a dealer's purchase of inventory. Wholesale inventory receivables have varying payment terms. We include wholesale inventory receivables in Receivables - trade and other and Long-term receivables - trade and other  in  Statement  3.  See  Note  7  for  further  information.  We  recognize  trade  receivables  from  dealers  and  end  users  in Receivables - trade and other and Long-term receivables trade and other in Statement 3. Trade receivables from dealers and end users  were  $7,267  million,  $6,310  million  and  $7,648  million  as  of  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $624 million, $657 million and $693 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nWe establish  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  ME&amp;T  receivables  when  it  becomes  probable  that  we  will  not  collect  the receivable. Our allowance for credit losses is not significant.\n\nWe invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products. We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3. Contract liabilities were $1,557 million, $1,526 million and $1,654 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We reduce the contract liability when we recognize revenue. During 2021, we recognized $903 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2021. During 2020, we recognized $1,012 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2020.\n\nWe have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $6.4 billion, with about one-third of the amount  expected  to  be  completed  and  revenue  recognized  in  the  twelve  months  following  December  31,  2021.  We  have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.\n\nWe exclude sales and other related taxes from the transaction price. We account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred as a fulfillment cost which is included in Cost of goods sold.\n\nWe provide a standard manufacturer's warranty of our products at no additional cost. At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities.\n\nSee Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.\n\n## B. Revenues of Financial Products\n\nRevenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. We record finance revenue over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the  accretion  of  certain  direct  origination  costs  that  are  deferred.  We  recognize  revenue  from  rental  payments  received  on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nWe suspend recognition of finance revenue and operating lease revenue and place the account on non-accrual status when management  determines  that  collection  of  future  income  is  not  probable  (generally  after  120  days  past  due).  We  resume recognition of revenue, and recognize previously suspended income, when we consider collection of remaining amounts to be probable.  We  write  off  interest  earned  but  uncollected  prior  to  the  receivable  being  placed  on  non-accrual  status  through Provision for credit  losses  when,  in  the  judgment  of  management,  we  consider  it  to  be  uncollectible.  See  Note  7  for  more information.",

          "chunk_text": "## G.    Income taxes\n\nWe determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions.  Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial  statements.  We  recognize  a  current  liability  for  the  estimated  taxes  payable  for  the  current  year.    Deferred  taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.    We  adjust  deferred  taxes  for  enacted  changes  in  tax  rates  and  tax  laws.    We  record  valuation  allowances  to  reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\n\n## H.    Goodwill\n\nFor acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.  A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from  the acquisition.  Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units.  When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, we reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.    We  review  goodwill  for  impairment  utilizing  either  a  qualitative  assessment  or  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment test.  If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.  For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired.  If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we would recognize the difference as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details.\n\n## I.    Estimates in financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill impairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.\n\n## J.    New accounting guidance\n\n## A. Adoption of new accounting standards\n\nReference  rate  reform (Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2020-04)  -  In  March  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur between March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, we elected  to  adopt  optional  expedients  impacting  our  derivative  instruments.  In  addition,  in  October  2021,  we  elected  to adopt  optional  expedients  for  contract  modifications.  Our  adoption  of  the  optional  expedients  did  not  have  a  material impact on our financial statements.\n\nWe  adopted  the  following  ASUs  effective  January  1,  2021,  none  of  which  had  a  material  impact  on  our  financial statements:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. G oodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets.  The  fair  value  for  acquired  customer  relationship  intangibles  is  determined  as  of  the  acquisition  date  based  on  estimates  and  judgments  regarding expectations for the future after-tax  cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that ex isted on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of ex pected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\n\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinitelived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method.  These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge.\n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of  October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\n\nContingent Liabilities. As described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  employee  benefit  plans,  legal,  and  environmental,  health,  and  safety  matters.  In  particular,  the  design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates.

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX was actively pursuing the divestiture of a portion of the Collins segment, specifically the actuation and flight control business, with a proposed sale to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, although the transaction was denied regulatory approval by the Italian government. This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",

While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023. This suggests a one-time event or accounting adjustment specific to 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M initiated divestiture-related restructuring actions following the split-off of its Food Safety business through a combination with Neogen Corporation. These actions focused on reducing corporate functional costs across the company, reflecting the need to realign resources after divesting a significant portion of its Safety and Industrial segment. By 2023, the scope of divestiture-related restructuring had evolved to include a gain from the sale of its dental local anesthetic business, which was partially offset by a loss tied to a contingent indemnification obligation from a prior 2020 divestiture. This indicates a shift from structural cost adjustments in 2022 to financial recalibration and management of legacy divestiture liabilities in 2023. While 2022's restructuring was primarily corporate-wide, 2023's actions were more segmented in nature, involving specific business units and legacy obligations.",

The Company's actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the distribution of performance shares were $4 million, $7 million, and $9 million per year for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Company's GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $27.80, $23.47 and $27.14, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESSP options of $32 million in 2021, $31 million in 2020, and $30 million in 2019.\n\n## NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in 'Elimination of Dual Credit'). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated'). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see Note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring actions (see Note 5).",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination and, thus, there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. We believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. We record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.\n\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the related provision.\n\nWe classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense, and if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities. The noncurrent portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are recorded in the caption 'Other liabilities' in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS. We are self-insured for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Accruals are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, which includes incurred-but-not-reported claims. Current workers' compensation claims, vehicle and general liability, and long-term disability are included in accrued expenses. We self-insure up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk. Claims costs are recognized on a gross basis and a receivable is recorded for amounts covered by third-party insurance. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance and premium expense.\n\nWe are also self-insured for certain short-term employee healthcare claims which are included within other accrued expenses.\n\nLEASES. We lease certain facilities, aircraft, equipment, and vehicles under operating and finance leases. A determination of whether a contract contains a lease is made at the inception of the arrangement. Our leased facilities include national, regional, and metropolitan sorting facilities; retail facilities; and administrative buildings.\n\nOur leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.\n\nFor real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume and index-based rate increases, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability. See Note 8 for additional information.",

      "question": "How has FedEx's approach to facility modernization evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of strategic emphasis and capital allocation, including specific investments in the Memphis World Hub and Indianapolis Hub?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx emphasized facility modernization as part of its broader strategic investments aimed at improving productivity, network efficiencies, and safety, though no specific figures or facilities were named. By 2023, the company had shifted toward concrete execution, disclosing a $5.2 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025 that includes modernization of the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub and expansion and modernization of the Indianapolis Hub. This evolution reflects a move from general strategic intent to specific, high-value facility investments that are central to FedEx\u2019s operational transformation.",

          "chunk_text": "Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our selfinsured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In 2015, a jury awarded compensatory damages of approximately $160 million to plaintiffs in connection with a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit filed against FedEx Ground in New Mexico state court. The award was subsequently affirmed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals and ultimately by the New Mexico Supreme Court in May 2022. While our insurance carriers have funded the approximately $160 million base judgment in excess of FedEx Ground's $7.5 million self-insured retention and insurance deductible, we are currently pursuing insurance coverage for reimbursement of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. See Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report for more information. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities. Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. Additionally, the ICAO's standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. We are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as investments in fleet and facility modernization and strategic investments to increase collaboration and automation and improve productivity, network efficiencies, and safety. Additionally, we are executing initiatives to use data to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members, as well as to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. See 'Item 1. Business' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nSuch initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions. For example, in 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. If we are not able to successfully implement this plan, our future financial results may suffer.\n\nChanges in our business strategy may also expose us to new and heightened risks. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2020, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other confidential information. The foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach. Developing privacy legislation within the U.S. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data within and among FedEx Dataworks, ShopRunner, and the other FedEx operating companies.",

Components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. These estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.\n\nWe believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations.

      "question": "What can be inferred about FedEx's approach to managing disability benefit liabilities based on the changes in disclosure between their 2022 and 2023 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that higher self-insurance accruals negatively impacted their results of operations, including those related to employee disability programs, but did not provide specific figures or structured detail on these liabilities. In contrast, the 2023 filing included a more detailed explanation of how self-insurance reserves are calculated, explicitly naming benefits paid under employee disability programs as a component of these reserves and noting that these estimates are based on actuarial methods that consider factors like claim severity, frequency, and healthcare inflation. While no explicit dollar figures for disability benefits were disclosed in either year, the increased transparency in 2023 suggests a more structured and detailed approach to managing and communicating these liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, FedEx acknowledged that self-insurance accruals, which include disability benefits, had a negative impact on results of operations, but provided limited detail on how these accruals were calculated or managed.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, FedEx expanded its disclosure to include a more comprehensive explanation of how self-insurance reserves are estimated, specifically naming disability benefits and detailing the actuarial methodology and assumptions used.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a general acknowledgment of impact in 2022 to a more structured and transparent disclosure in 2023 indicates a change in how FedEx communicates its approach to managing disability benefit liabilities, even though specific dollar amounts were not disclosed."

          "chunk_text": "We have also incurred increased operating expenses related to personal protective equipment and medical/safety supplies, as well as additional security and cleaning services, in order to protect our team members and customers. Due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our operations, the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employees may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries.\n\nAdditionally, a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business operations may be disrupted, and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects on our business, if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.\n\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition as well as the global economy, will be dictated by future developments that remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as its duration and spread, the success of efforts to contain it and treat its impact, the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the impact of actions taken in response, resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate, the future rate of e-commerce growth, and the timeline for recovery of passenger airline cargo capacity.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations; our ability to implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; our ability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses; changes in the business and financial soundness of the USPS; our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the impact of litigation or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic or our actions in response to the pandemic.\n\nFor more information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, see 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Operations and Outlook-Consolidated Results' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us. We are self-insured up to certain limits that vary by type of risk for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. Our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. Estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years. Material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. As a result, our insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. During 2022, higher self-insurance accruals negatively impacted our results of operations. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nAs a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we self-insure. Periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called 'nuclear' verdicts, including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families (such as the recently affirmed award by a New Mexico state court jury in a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit against FedEx Ground discussed below). Given this recent trend, it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any other claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess in addition to our other self-insured amounts.",

The difference between our CAS expense and the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) service cost attributable to these segments under  U.S.  GAAP  is  the  FAS/CAS  operating  adjustment.  The  FAS/CAS  operating  adjustment  results  in  consolidated  pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost, as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nIn  2021, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $331 million, including severance costs of $80 million related to workforce reductions of 6,432 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the re-alignment of a product line in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment, site transitions, mainly in Aerospace, to more cost-effective locations, and the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $117 million primarily related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $134  million  primarily  for  current  period  exit  costs  incurred  for  previously  approved  repositioning  projects,  closure  obligations associated with site transitions, and lease obligations for equipment. Also, $13 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions.\n\nIn 2021, Other charges include $105 million of incremental long-term contract labor cost inefficiencies due to severe supply chain disruptions  (attributable  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic)  relating  to  the  warehouse  automation  business  within  the  Safety  and Productivity Solutions segment. Certain of these costs incurred include amounts and provisions for anticipated losses recognized during the fourth quarter when total estimated costs at completion for certain of the business' long-term contracts exceeded total estimated revenue. These costs represent unproductive labor costs due to unexpected supply delays and the resulting downstream installation issues, demobilization and remobilization of contract workers, and resolution of contractor disputes. These costs do not include normal operational inefficiencies experienced during a challenging operating environment in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $565 million, including severance costs of $475 million related to workforce reductions of 14,159 manufacturing and administrative positions across the Company's segments, with a majority of the workforce reductions in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies. The workforce reductions primarily related to the Company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, the  Company's  productivity  and  ongoing  functional  transformation  initiatives,  and  to  site  consolidations  and  hub  strategies.  The repositioning charge included exit costs of $69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. Also, $47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments.\n\nIn 2019, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $438 million, including severance costs of $260 million related to workforce  reductions  of  5,336  manufacturing  and  administrative  positions  across  the  Company's  segments.  The  workforce reductions related to the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site transitions, mainly in Honeywell  Building  Technologies,  as  the  Company  transitions  manufacturing  to  more  cost-effective  locations.  The  repositioning charge  included  asset  impairments  of  $95  million  largely  related  to  a  write  down  in  connection  with  assets  held  for  sale.  The repositioning charge included exit costs of $83 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning  projects,  termination  fees  associated  with  the  early  cancellation  of  supply  agreements  for  certain  raw  materials  in Performance  Materials  and  Technologies  and  Honeywell  Building  Technologies  and  for  closure  obligations  associated  with  site transitions.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\n69",

By 2024, this figure had decreased to $0.5 billion, with only an insignificant amount tied to GE Vernova. This reduction reflects the tax implications of the spin-off, as GE no longer retained the associated tax benefits from the spun-off entity.

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

This shift contributed to a $4.3 billion decrease in Corporate & Other operating profit in 2024, despite the improvement in gains on business interests, due to larger declines in other areas such as retained ownership interests. In 2023, the small loss of $9 million did not significantly affect the overall $5.8 billion increase in Corporate & Other operating profit driven mainly by gains on retained and sold ownership interests.",

We believe that adjusting Corporate &amp; Other costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 , rev enue decreased by $0.2 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher intercompany eliminations, partially offset by an increase in our run-off insurance operations revenue.

Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, primarily related to the separations, are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes.

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits.

      "question": "How did GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of indemnification responsibilities and deferred tax asset implications?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that upon spin-off, GE Vernova would be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support-related payments, with an expectation that the fair value of this obligation would not be significant due to the low probability of loss. GE's exposure under these credit support arrangements could not be reasonably estimated, but contractual maturities of $15 billion each for Power and Renewable Energy segments within five years were highlighted. By 2024, the deferred tax assets associated with losses in discontinued operations, which include GE Vernova, decreased from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount, suggesting a reduction in the tax basis liability linked to these indemnifications. This indicates that the spin-off led to a material shift in how these obligations were accounted for, with GE no longer carrying the same level of tax-related exposure tied to GE Vernova's past credit support arrangements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1: In 2023, GE detailed indemnification obligations from GE Vernova related to $65 billion in credit support, with $30 billion maturing within five years, though the fair value of indemnification was expected to be insignificant.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2: In 2024, deferred tax assets tied to GE Vernova's discontinued operations dropped from $0.6 billion to an insignificant amount, implying reduced tax liability exposure post-spin-off.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: The shift from a $0.6 billion tax-related liability in 2023 to an insignificant amount in 2024 indicates that the indemnification responsibilities moved off GE's balance sheet, reflecting the completion or near-completion of the spin-off transition."

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Resource Industries segment reported a 27% increase in sales, amounting to $582 million growth from $2,180 million to $2,762 million. However, by 2024, the segment experienced a 9% decrease in sales, with a $1,194 million decline from $13,583 million in 2023 to $12,389 million in 2024. This shift from significant growth to a notable decline indicates a reversal in the segment's performance, contrasting with the overall trend of modest decline in consolidated sales. This evolution suggests that the Resource Industries segment weakened relative to other segments over this period.",

Sales increased across all applications and inter-segment sales.\n\n- Oil and Gas - Sales increased for reciprocating engines aftermarket parts across all regions, turbines and turbine-related services and reciprocating engines used in gas compression.\n- Power  Generation  -  Sales  rose  due  to  higher  sales  volume  in  reciprocating  engines  aftermarket  parts  and  small reciprocating engine applications.\n- Industrial - Sales were up due to higher demand across all regions.\n- Transportation  -Sales  increased  due  to  higher  deliveries  of  locomotives,  which  were  primarily  international,  and  rail services.\n\nEnergy &amp; Transportation's profit was $675 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $12 million, or 2 percent, compared with $687 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was due to unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses, mostly offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, higher period manufacturing and material costs.\n\nBoth SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses and period manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense and investments aligned with growth initiatives, including acquisition-related expenses.\n\nEnergy &amp; Transportation's profit as a percent of total sales was 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Financial Products Segment\n\nFinancial Products' segment revenues were $776 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $33 million, or 4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2020.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues  vary  with  volume  (carloads)  and  ARC.  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  drive  ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes,  are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer  incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  volumes,  and  recognized  as  the  related  performance  obligation  is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue  between  reporting  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Accessorial  revenues  are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge  revenue,  core  pricing  gains,  and  positive  mix  of  traffic  (for  example,  a  relative  increase  in  industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery  from  the  depressed  economy  brought  on  by  the  COVID  pandemic  in  2020.  While  the  markets  have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  revenues  of  $1.7  billion  and  $1.0  billion  in  2021  and  2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in  carloadings,  partially  offset  by  the  lag  impact  on  fuel  surcharge  (it  can  generally  take  up  to  two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\n\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive  production  offset  the  recovery  from  other  COVID  related  declines  in  2020.  Accessorial  revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Safety - The health and wellbeing of our employees was a focal point in 2021 as we navigated the continuously changing  environment  due  to  COVID.  We  have  and  are  continuing  to  adapt  to  protect  the  safety  of  our employees,  our  customers,  and  the  communities  we  serve.  Safety  procedures  and  policies  continue  to  be refined based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\n- In this ever-changing environment, we remain intently focused on reducing risk and eliminating incidents for our employees,  our  customers,  and  the  public.  We  continued  to  use  Total  Safety  Culture,  Courage  to  Care, COMMIT  (Coaching, Observing, Mentoring, and Motivating with Integrity and Trust), and Peer to Peer throughout our operations to enhance employee safety and engagement. Throughout the year, we worked to  implement a physics engine and proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention to prevent derailments. Despite these efforts, our safety results deteriorated year-overyear. Our reportable personal injury incidents rate per 200,000 employee-hours of 0.98 increased 9% from 2020 and our reportable equipment incident rate per million train miles increased 7%. In the second half of 2021, we engaged a third-party expert to evaluate the effectiveness of our safety programs and received recommendations for improvement, which we will implement in 2022.\n- Network Operations -  We  faced  many operational challenges throughout 2021, including Winter Storm Uri, global supply chain disruptions, wildfires, bridge outages, mudslides, and hurricanes. These challenges required adjustments to our transportation plans and impacted overall fluidity of the network. As a result, many of our operating metrics deteriorated year-over-year. Freight car velocity decreased due to increased terminal dwell and  higher  operating  car  inventory  levels,  which  drove  lower  trip  plan  compliance.  To  assist  with  improving network fluidity we are maintaining higher crew and locomotive resources in the short-term. Once the network is balanced and service is restored, we will adjust our resources to the current volume levels. Additional details on these metrics are discussed in Other Operating/Performance and Financial Statistics of this Item 7.\n- Freight  Revenues -  Our  freight  revenues  increased  11%  year-over-year  to  $20.2  billion  driven  by  a  4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic (for example, a relative  increase  in  industrial  shipments,  which  have  a  higher  average  revenue  per  car  (ARC)).  Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery from the depressed economy brought on by the COVID pandemic in 2020. While the markets rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels were 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\n- Financial Results -In 2021, we generated operating income of $9.3 billion, 19% above 2020, as we recovered from the impacts of COVID. In addition, 2020 included a non-cash impairment charge of $278 million related to our Brazos yard investment. Higher fuel prices, increased volume-related costs, inflation, and costs associated with Winter Storm Uri and the wildfires in California drove operating expenses up 7% from 2020. Revenue from the additional volume and traffic mix, higher fuel surcharge revenue, improved pricing, productivity initiatives, and  intermodal  accessorial  charges  more  than  offset  the  increased  expenses,  producing  an  all-time  record 57.2% operating ratio, improving 2.7 points from 2020. Net income of $6.5 billion translated into earnings of $9.95 per diluted share, up 26% from 2020.\n- Fuel Prices - Our average price of diesel fuel in 2021 was $2.23 per gallon, an increase of 49% from 2020. The higher price resulted in higher operating expenses of $668 million (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume increases). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n- Liquidity - We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents. Despite the challenging year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating  activities,  yielding  free  cash  flow  of  $3.5  billion  after  reductions  of  $2.7  billion  for  cash  used  in investing activities and $2.8 billion in dividends. We repurchased $7.3 billion of our shares. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants. We have $2.0 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility and up to $500 million undrawn on our Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn. Additional details are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 7.\n\nFree  cash  flow  is  defined  as  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  cash  used  in  investing  activities  and dividends paid. Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  investors  in  evaluating  our  financial  performance  and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):\n\n",

By 2023, freight revenues decreased 3% to $22.6 billion, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and a negative mix of traffic, such as decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments, despite core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume. These changes indicate a shift from growth driven by broad-based volume and pricing in 2022 to a contraction influenced by fuel and mix effects in 2023.",

Freight  revenues  from  bulk  shipments  increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a 5% volume increase, core pricing  gains,  higher  fuel  surcharge  revenue,  and  positive business mix. Despite weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021,  volume  increased  with  strong  demand  for  grain  in  the first half of the year and coal in the second half, due to higher natural  gas  prices.  In  addition,  strength  in  the  export  potash market and recovery from the COVID pandemic that negatively impacted production of imported beer, food products, and the demand for ethanol and related products in 2020 contributed to additional increases in volume.\n\nIndustrial -Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals  and  plastics,  metals  and  minerals,  forest  products, and  energy  and  specialized  markets.  Freight  revenues  from industrial shipments increased in 2021 versus 2020 due a 6% increase in volume, core pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge, and positive mix of traffic. Strength from the pandemic recovery overcame the first quarter 2021 losses caused by Winter Storm Uri disruptions in the Gulf Coast, which impacted the industrial chemicals  and  plastics  and  metals  and  minerals  industries. Additionally, forest product shipments increased due to higher demand for cardboard boxes and lumber.\n\n## 2021 Bulk Carloads\n\n2021 Industrial Carloads\n\nPremium -Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers,  both  domestic  and  international.  Freight  revenues from  premium  shipments  increased  11%  in  2021  compared to 2020, despite the weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021, driven by higher fuel surcharges, core pricing gains, and a 2% volume increase. Automotive shipments of 173 thousand carloads in the second quarter of 2021 were more than double the 79 thousand carloads in the same period in 2020 as North American  manufacturing  plants  suspended  production  due  to the pandemic in that year. This recovery masked the impact to automotive shipments in 2021 due to the on-going shortage of semiconductors.  Excluding  the  second  quarter,  automotive shipments are  down  14%  year-over-year. The  pandemic  also upended the intermodal supply chain as demand for consumer goods remained high. This high demand strained port capacity, chassis availability, truck driver supply, and warehouse receiving capacity. Despite the global supply chain disruptions, intermodal shipments increased 2% in 2021 due to improving economic conditions,  inventory  restocking,  contract  wins,  and continued strength of e-commerce and parcel shipments.\n\n2021 Premium Carloads\n\nMexico Business - Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business was $2.4 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to 2020, driven by a 3% increase in volume and higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic. The volume increase was driven by the recovery from the 2020 pandemic and an increase in petroleum and grain shipments, partially offset by the impact of the global supply chain disruptions on intermodal shipments and the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\n",

In 2024, the growth was attributed specifically to 'additional maintenance work.' This indicates a continuation of the prior year\u2019s trend but with a narrower focus, suggesting that while the segment is still leveraging existing aircraft for service demand, it may be relying more heavily on incremental maintenance opportunities to sustain growth. This shift helped offset the decline in aircraft manufacturing revenue, which fell due to supply chain constraints in 2023 and likely remained under pressure in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the revenue from aircraft manufacturing evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what factors contributed to the change in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, aircraft manufacturing revenue was $7 million, as disclosed in the financial breakdown. In 2024, this revenue stream increased, driven by additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, this growth came with added costs due to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted operational efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company reported aircraft manufacturing revenue as $7 million, indicating a relatively small contribution to overall revenue.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, aircraft manufacturing revenue increased due to new deliveries, specifically the G700 aircraft, although operational costs rose due to supply chain issues.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects growth in aircraft manufacturing revenue, but with notable operational challenges that accompanied the increase in production and delivery volume."

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that it was actively investing in transformation strategy costs, indicating a forward-looking commitment to modernizing its operations. By 2024, the transformation strategy costs had decreased from $213 million in 2023 to $109 million in 2024, representing a 48.8% reduction. This significant decline suggests that UPS may have completed or scaled back major elements of its transformation initiatives, shifting focus from strategic investment to cost optimization or operational stabilization.",

By 2024, the company's total Transformation Strategy Costs had significantly increased to $322 million for 2024 from $435 million in 2023. This indicates a substantial shift in strategic investment focus, with UPS accelerating its transformation initiatives under Transformation 2.0, including efforts like 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined.'

      "answer": "In 2022, the collaboration partners' share of financing guarantees was $142 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing the 2022 filing). By 2023, the collaboration partners' share had decreased to $135 million at December 31, 2023. This indicates a reduction in the partners' exposure to these guarantees over the period, suggesting a potential de-risking or renegotiation of financing arrangements.",

Collaboration  partners'  share  of  these  financing  guarantees  is  $141  million  and  $142  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nWe also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $120 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. For additional information regarding the environmental indemnifications, see 'Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\nWe  accrue  for  costs  associated  with  guarantees  when  it  is  probable  that  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  can  be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.\n\nWe also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal  service  and  warranty  policies  on  some  of  our  products,  particularly  commercial  aircraft  engines.  In  addition,  we  incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant. The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n",

By 2023, the risk profile shifted significantly to production and technological challenges, particularly concerning Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine family. A rare condition in powder metal used for certain engine parts required accelerated inspections of the PW1100G-JM GTF fleet, leading to increased engine removals, inspections, shop visits, and aircraft on ground levels. These issues resulted in material additional costs to the company, including potential liquidated damages or other liabilities, marking a clear shift from supply chain disruptions to internal production and technological execution risks with direct financial consequences.",

By 2023, RTX shifted focus to new legal exposures stemming from the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and an SEC investigation, again noting that any related loss contingency accruals were not material. The evolution reflects a transition from antitrust-related employment issues to securities disclosure and manufacturing-related litigation, while maintaining a consistent stance on materiality.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ninformation available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n## DOJ Grand Jury Investigation and Related Civil Litigation\n\nThe Company received a grand jury subpoena in late 2019, as part of a DOJ criminal investigation into purported agreements not to solicit or hire employees in violation of the federal antitrust laws. While the investigation has focused on alleged hiring restrictions between and among Pratt &amp; Whitney and certain of its suppliers of outsourced engineering services, the subpoena also included requests  regarding  Collins  Aerospace.  Since  receipt  of  the  subpoena,  the  Company  has  been  cooperating  with  the  DOJ investigation.  On  December  15,  2021,  a  criminal  indictment  was  filed  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Connecticut, against a former Pratt &amp; Whitney employee and other employees of certain outsourced engineering suppliers charging each of them with one count of violating the federal antitrust laws. No current or former Collins Aerospace employees were named in the indictment. We were recently advised that the Company is a target of the DOJ investigation, and we continue to cooperate with the investigation. No criminal charge has been filed against the Company or its affiliates.\n\nAfter the criminal charges against the individuals were filed, numerous civil class action antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Pratt &amp; Whitney and other corporate and individual defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The allegations in each of the civil lawsuits track the factual assertions in the criminal indictment and generally allege that Pratt &amp; Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs in each of the civil lawsuits seek to represent different purported classes of engineers and skilled laborers employed by Pratt &amp; Whitney and other supplier-defendants since 2011. Collins Aerospace was also named as a  defendant  in  some  of  the  lawsuits.  Plaintiffs  in  each  of  the  lawsuits  seek  treble  damages  in  an  undetermined  amount,  plus attorneys' fees and costs of suit. We expect that all the lawsuits ultimately will be consolidated into a single joint complaint. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWhere appropriate, we have recorded loss contingency accruals for the above-referenced matters, and the amounts individually, or in the aggregate, are not material.\n\nOther. As described in 'Note 18: Guarantees,' we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nWe also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of  contract,  product  liability,  warranty,  regulatory,  environmental,  health  and  safety,  employment,  intellectual  property,  tax  and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.",

In contrast, 2024 margins were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes, inflation, investments in the business, restructuring costs, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, and China-related challenges.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2024 completed as of October 1, 2024, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2024, 3M had 16 primary reporting units, with five reporting units accounting for approximately 85 percent of the goodwill. These five reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Commercial Branding and Transportation, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, and Personal Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2025 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions: The extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final tax es paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with tax ing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax  liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the ex tent to which, additional tax es will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income tax es, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 11 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax  liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 11 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 3M owned 19.9% of Solventum Corporation common stock which ownership interest's fair value was $2.3 billion. As previously disclosed, 3M intends to divest its ownership in Solventum within five years from its April 2024 spin-off.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nTotal debt: The strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio , including scheduled maturities in the next 12 months as referenced in Note 14. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S&amp;P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch.\n\nThe Company's total debt associated with continuing operations at December 31, 2024 decreased when compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of $2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of $1.1 billion of medium-term notes and $1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Amounts borrowed by Solventum during the first quarter of 2024 were a liability associated with discontinued operations and, as transferred obligations, became the sole responsibility of Solventum after the April 1, 2024 Separation, as discussed in Note 14.

General Electric Company (General Electric, GE or the Company) is a high-tech industrial company that operates worldwide through its four segments, Aviation, Healthcare, Renewable Energy, and Power. Our products include commercial and military aircraft engines and systems; healthcare systems and pharmaceutical diagnostics; wind and other renewable energy generation equipment and grid solutions; and gas, steam, nuclear and other power generation equipment. We have significant global installed bases of equipment across these sectors, and services to support these products are also an important part of our business alongside new equipment sales. As described further below, in November 2021 we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses. This section provides an overview of GE's business at a consolidated level. See the Segment Operations section within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) for more details about segment-level business descriptions, product and service offerings and competitive, regulatory and other trends, dynamics and developments. See also the Consolidated Results section within MD&amp;A and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our announced and recent business portfolio actions.\n\nWe serve customers in over 175 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 71 manufacturing plants located in 26 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 130 manufacturing plants located in 33 other countries.\n\nOver our 130-year history, GE's innovation and technology have improved quality of life around the world. GE's businesses today are working to adapt and innovate solutions to three of the world's most pressing challenges: the future of smarter and more efficient flight, precision healthcare that personalizes diagnoses and treatments and the energy transition to drive decarbonization.\n\n- Future of flight - The future of flight will be defined by how the aviation industry emerges from the current market cycle and innovates to lower emissions and improves fuel efficiency. The focus on long-term sustainability has accelerated notwithstanding the significant challenges that the industry has faced, and continues to face, with the significant disruptions and decreases in commercial air travel globally in connection with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our Aviation business over many decades has contributed to advances in engine architectures, aerodynamics and materials and the use of sustainable aviation fuels that have resulted in today's aircraft engines consuming significantly less fuel with lower emissions. The Aviation business continues to invest in and work toward development of the next suite of engine technologies, including open fan architectures, hybrid electric and electrical propulsion concepts and advanced thermal management concepts, that offer the potential for future efficiency improvements and emission reductions to meet our customers' needs and global standards governing commercial aviation.\n- Precision health - The healthcare industry faces the need to address productivity challenges by improving access, enabling more precise patient diagnosis and treatment, shortening hospital stays and wait times and lowering overall costs. Amidst the limited resources and burdens on healthcare systems, both from the COVID-19 pandemic recently and from aging populations more generally, these challenges are even more pronounced. Our Healthcare business is working to help support the future of healthcare that will merge clinical medicine and data science by applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence across the patient journey. With its products, services and digital capabilities, the Healthcare business is focused on building an intelligencebased healthcare system and a healthier world and greater access to the half of the world's population that is underserved.\n- Energy transition - Addressing climate change is an urgent global priority, and at the same time energy demand is increasing and roughly one billion people around the world are without access to reliable power. Our Renewable Energy and Power businesses play a central role in helping our customers meet this demand for electricity generation while lowering carbon intensity and making power generation more reliable, affordable and sustainable. These businesses' technology and expertise include onshore and offshore wind turbines, gas turbines and digital controls and hardware solutions that bring more renewables onto power grids while making the grid more resilient. Increasingly there is a focus on the potential for breakthrough technologies that can help drive deeper decarbonization of the power sector in the future, such as small modular or other advanced nuclear power, hydrogen and carbon capture. Progress in significantly reducing power sector emissions in the near term, while significantly accelerating technological innovation for higher renewable penetration and lower carbon-power generation, will also enable further emission reductions of other sectors through the electrification of transportation, heat and industry.\n\nWe believe our businesses' strategies and focus on these significant global challenges are well aligned with broader goals of sustainable development, and we approach sustainability with GE's commitment to innovation as a central element. Sustainability priorities are embedded in our policies, leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments, and, ultimately, our products. In addition to working to develop technologies that will help build a more sustainable world, we advance GE's sustainability priorities through our own commitments to our people, communities and planet. More information that may be of interest to a variety of stakeholders about GE's sustainability approach, priorities and performance, including about safety, greenhouse gas emission reductions for our own operations and for our products, environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion (as also discussed further below), supply chain and human rights and other matters, can be found in our Sustainability Report.\n\nIn all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive environment is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we continue to make improvements through deployment of lean initiatives and we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's approach to determining the obsolescence rate for intangible assets evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's valuation methodology?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson used internal judgment and historical information from Aspen Technology, Inc. to determine the obsolescence rate for developed technology intangible assets. By 2024, the company had evolved its approach by involving valuation professionals to evaluate obsolescence rates through comparisons with industry peers and historical transactions. This indicates a shift toward more externally validated and benchmarked methodologies for asset valuation.",

The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 9 through 11.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.\n\nIn some circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, including intangible assets, are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. In fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Aspen Technology, Inc. and engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of intangible assets. This included the use of certain assumptions and estimates, including the projected revenue for the customer relationship and developed technology intangible asset and the obsolescence rate for the developed technology intangible asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate, they require judgement and are based on experience and historical information obtained from Aspen Technology, Inc.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition resulted in intangibles amortization of $148, with $51 reported in Cost of sales. By 2024, AspenTech's amortization of intangibles was $486, consistent with the prior year. This indicates that the amortization costs from the acquisition remained a persistent financial burden over the two-year period, without any reduction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Heritage AspenTech acquisition led to $148 in intangibles amortization, with $51 included in Cost of sales.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, AspenTech's amortization of intangibles remained at $486, showing no decrease from the prior year.",
        "Step 3: The amortization costs related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition did not decrease, indicating a sustained financial impact over time."

      "answer": "In 2022, the Adjusted EBITA margin reached 38.0%, driven by strong growth in earnings despite rising amortization costs. By 2024, the Adjusted EBITA margin had decreased to 24.6%, even though total Adjusted EBITA increased to $2,854 million from $249 million in 2022. This margin contraction reflects a shift in the company's cost structure, including $68 million in restructuring costs in 2024 compared to none in 2022, and uneven segment performance\u2014such as Discrete Automation experiencing a 6% decline in earnings while Measurement & Analytical saw 19% growth. The earlier margin expansion was fueled by rapid earnings growth across all segments, whereas the 2024 margin trend shows a more moderate 2.2-point increase driven primarily by Final Control and Measurement & Analytical divisions.",

By 2024, UNP continued to highlight the importance of the cash flow conversion rate to management and investors, reaffirming its role in assessing financial performance, but maintained that it should be considered alongside GAAP measures like cash provided by operating activities. However, the 2024 disclosure appears to reduce the explanatory emphasis compared to 2022, suggesting a more established understanding of the metric by stakeholders.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Freight Revenues were driven by a 5% volume increase in Bulk shipments and a 6% increase in Industrial shipments, along with core pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge revenue, and positive business mix. Fuel surcharge revenue was a strong contributor due to elevated fuel prices. By 2024, Freight Revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $22.8 billion, driven by a 3% increase in volumes, primarily from international intermodal and grain shipments, but this was offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues due to a 15% decrease in fuel prices. The mix of traffic also shifted negatively in 2024, with a relative increase in lower-revenue international intermodal shipments. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.0 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024, reflecting reduced fuel prices and a lag effect in surcharge adjustments. The 2021 growth was heavily influenced by pandemic recovery and supply chain dynamics, while 2024 showed a more normalized but mixed demand environment.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the composition and drivers of Freight Revenues, shifting from strong pandemic recovery growth and fuel surcharge tailwinds in 2021 to a more subdued environment in 2024 with volume gains offset by lower pricing and mix effects."

          "chunk_text": "Bulk -  Bulk  includes  shipments  of  grain  and  grain  products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated goods, and coal and renewables. Freight  revenues  from  bulk  shipments  increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a 5% volume increase, core pricing  gains,  higher  fuel  surcharge  revenue,  and  positive business mix. Despite weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021,  volume  increased  with  strong  demand  for  grain  in  the first half of the year and coal in the second half, due to higher natural  gas  prices.  In  addition,  strength  in  the  export  potash market and recovery from the COVID pandemic that negatively impacted production of imported beer, food products, and the demand for ethanol and related products in 2020 contributed to additional increases in volume.\n\nIndustrial -Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals  and  plastics,  metals  and  minerals,  forest  products, and  energy  and  specialized  markets.  Freight  revenues  from industrial shipments increased in 2021 versus 2020 due a 6% increase in volume, core pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge, and positive mix of traffic. Strength from the pandemic recovery overcame the first quarter 2021 losses caused by Winter Storm Uri disruptions in the Gulf Coast, which impacted the industrial chemicals  and  plastics  and  metals  and  minerals  industries. Additionally, forest product shipments increased due to higher demand for cardboard boxes and lumber.\n\n## 2021 Bulk Carloads\n\n2021 Industrial Carloads\n\nPremium -Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers,  both  domestic  and  international.  Freight  revenues from  premium  shipments  increased  11%  in  2021  compared to 2020, despite the weather disruptions in the first quarter of 2021, driven by higher fuel surcharges, core pricing gains, and a 2% volume increase. Automotive shipments of 173 thousand carloads in the second quarter of 2021 were more than double the 79 thousand carloads in the same period in 2020 as North American  manufacturing  plants  suspended  production  due  to the pandemic in that year. This recovery masked the impact to automotive shipments in 2021 due to the on-going shortage of semiconductors.  Excluding  the  second  quarter,  automotive shipments are  down  14%  year-over-year. The  pandemic  also upended the intermodal supply chain as demand for consumer goods remained high. This high demand strained port capacity, chassis availability, truck driver supply, and warehouse receiving capacity. Despite the global supply chain disruptions, intermodal shipments increased 2% in 2021 due to improving economic conditions,  inventory  restocking,  contract  wins,  and continued strength of e-commerce and parcel shipments.\n\n2021 Premium Carloads\n\nMexico Business - Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business was $2.4 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to 2020, driven by a 3% increase in volume and higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic. The volume increase was driven by the recovery from the 2020 pandemic and an increase in petroleum and grain shipments, partially offset by the impact of the global supply chain disruptions on intermodal shipments and the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\n",

Freight rev enues v ary with v olumes (carloads) and av erage rev enue  per  car  (ARC).  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  driv e ARC.  Customer  incentiv es,  which  are  primarily  prov ided  for  shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulativ e v olumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating rev enues. Customer incentiv es that include v ariable consideration  based  on  cumulativ e  v olumes  are  estimated  using  the  expected  v alue  method,  which  is  based  on  av ailable  historical,  current,  and forecasted v olumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight rev enues ov er time as shipments mov e from origin to destination. T he allocation of rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther  subsidiary  rev enues  (primarily  logistics  and  commuter  rail  operations)  are  generally  recognized  ov er  time  as  shipments  mov e  from  origin  to destination. T he allocation of rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial rev enues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nFreight rev enues increased 1% year-ov er-year to $22.8 billion driv en by a 3% increase in v olumes and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge rev enues and negativ e mix of traffic (for example, a relativ e increase in international intermodal shipments, which hav e a lower ARC). Volume increaseswere primarily driv en by international intermodal and grain and grain product shipments, partially offset by weaker demand for coal and rock shipments.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  rev enues  of  $2.6  billion  and  $3.0billion  in  2024and  2023,  respectiv ely.  Fuel  surcharge  rev enues  in 2024decreased $0.4billion due toa 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lag impact of fluctuating fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recov eries), partially offset by higher v olumes.\n\nIn 2024, other subsidiary rev enues decreased compared to 2023primarily driv en by a weaker demand for intermodal shipments at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and transload logistics serv ices and the partial transfer of our commuter operations to  Metra. Accessorial rev enues decreased in 2024compared to 2023driven by lower intermodal accessorial rev enues because of our intermodal equipment sale, partially offset by a one-time contract settlement.",

By 2024, the segment composition had changed due to the separation of Solventum, which introduced new acquisition and divestiture impacts, including commercial agreements affecting sales change calculations.

To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated.\n\nCertain additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2023 and 2022, not otherwise impacted by reflection of the above for applicable prior periods presented, can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in 3M's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n3M manages its continuing operations in three operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction and, beginning April 2024, include the impact of commercial agreements associated with the separation of Solventum. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\n3M is impacted by certain special items such as costs for significant litigation and the sales and income associated with manufactured PFAS products. See Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items, including references therein to where further information is provided.\n\nAdditional information regarding certain items impacting pre-2024 periods that may also be relevant in 2024 can be found in the Overview section of Part II, Item 7 as well as in further sections of 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted: The following table provides the increases (decreases) in diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share.\n\n",

By 2024, the segment remained a core part of 3M's business following the Health Care separation, as indicated by its inclusion among the three main businesses listed: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. However, the 2024 filing does not provide direct sales data, so while the prior year's performance suggests the segment faced challenges, the specific post-separation performance and strategic positioning of the segment cannot be definitively assessed from the available 2024 evidence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Transportation and Electronics segment had a total sales decline of 4.5%, with organic sales down 3.5% and translation negatively impacting by 1.0%.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the segment was explicitly listed as one of the three core businesses following the Health Care business separation, indicating continued strategic importance, though no updated sales figures were provided in the evidence chunk.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic evolution where the segment remains a key business area post-separation, but its performance post-2023 cannot be quantitatively assessed due to lack of updated data in the provided evidence."

      "answer": "In 2023, 3M reported a deferred federal tax liability of $(3,074) million, which dramatically shifted to a positive deferred federal tax liability of $328 million in 2024. This represents a significant transformation in the company's deferred federal tax position, moving from a large net credit to a net debit. This change was a key driver in the overall shift in Total Tax Payable, which went from $(2,691) million in 2023 to $804 million in 2024, indicating a fundamental change in the company's tax obligations and timing of tax payments.",
