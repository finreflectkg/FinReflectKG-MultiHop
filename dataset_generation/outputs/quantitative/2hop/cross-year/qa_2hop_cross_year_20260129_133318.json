      "answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's asset retirement obligations (AROs) included dismantlement liabilities for certain wind and solar facilities, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER\u2019s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's AROs included dismantlement obligations for wind and solar facilities, with costs capitalized and later expensed systematically.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, NEE clarified that NEER explicitly includes a provision for dismantlement and asset removal costs within depreciation expense, signaling a more defined approach.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more structured and transparent integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER\u2019s financial reporting, evolving from a general capitalization and amortization approach to a more explicit inclusion in depreciation policy."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nAsset  Retirement  Obligations -  NEE  and  FPL  each  account  for  asset  retirement  obligations  and  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived  assets.  NEE's AROs  relate  primarily  to  decommissioning  obligations  of  FPL's  and  NEER's  nuclear  units  and  to  obligations  for  the dismantlement  of  certain  of  NEER's  wind  and  solar  facilities.  See  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\n\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using  a  systematic  and  rational  method  over  the  asset's  estimated  useful  life.  Changes  in  the ARO  resulting  from  the  passage  of  time  are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs - For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear and other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear  decommissioning  and  other  generation  dismantlement  studies  periodically  filed  with  the  FPSC.  In  addition,  FPL  accrues  for  interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\n\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively, and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $10.2 billion, or $2.4 billion expressed in 2021 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the application submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds,  which  are  included  in  special  use  funds  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Marketable  securities  held  in  the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2021, 2020 and 2019 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $173 million, $132 million and $125 million, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nOther  generation  plant  dismantlement  studies  are  performed  periodically  and  are  submitted  to  the  FPSC  for  approval.  Previously  approved studies were effective from January 1, 2017 through December 2021 and resulted in an annual expense of $26 million which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved a new annual expense of $48 million based on FPL's updated dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. At December  31,  2021,  FPL's  portion  of  the  ultimate  cost  to  dismantle  its  other  generation  units  is  approximately  $2.5  billion,  or  $1.2  billion expressed in 2021 dollars.\n\nNEER's AROs  primarily  include  nuclear  decommissioning  liabilities  for  Seabrook  Station  (Seabrook),  Duane  Arnold  Energy  Center  (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEER's capital expenditures for wind energy were $3,777 million and for solar energy (including solar plus battery storage projects) were $2,011 million. In 2023, NEER's wind-related expenditures decreased to $2,820 million, while solar expenditures increased significantly to $3,270 million. This indicates a strategic shift from wind to solar energy investments over the year.",

By 2023, this amount had increased to $1.5 billion, indicating a significant increase in NEER's investment in new project development. Additionally, in 2023, NEER clarified its policy that these costs include land rights and third-party expenses directly tied to project development and may either be transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets depending on the nature of the cost. This evolution suggests a more aggressive or expanded project development strategy by NEER in 2023 compared to 2022.",

By 2024, NEECH became more deeply involved in NEE's capital structure through the issuance of equity units that included NEECH debentures, with NEE guaranteeing these debentures. In June and October 2024, NEE sold $3.5 billion in equity units, each including a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in NEECH debentures. Additionally, in early 2025, NEECH issued over $7 billion in various debentures, further deepening its financial entanglement with NEE. This represents a transformation in the financial relationship, with NEECH becoming a more integral part of NEE\u2019s capital-raising activities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NEE's interest expense was allocated from NEECH based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt. By 2024, NEE had issued multiple tranches of equity units that included NEECH debentures, such as $2.0 billion in June 2024 and $1.5 billion in October 2024, with each unit containing a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in NEECH debentures. These equity units carried total annual distribution rates of 7.299% and 7.234% respectively, combining interest on debentures and payments under stock purchase contracts. This indicates a shift from a passive interest allocation to a more structured and active capital-raising relationship involving NEECH's debt instruments.",

Additionally, NEE's equity unit offerings in 2024, which included NEECH debentures as components, indicate a strategic financial dependency on NEECH to support NEE's capital structure.

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn June 2024, NEE sold $2.0 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially , a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series N Debenture due June 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than June 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.6915 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $72.31 (the reference price) to 0.5532 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $90.38 (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending on M ay 26, 2027. T otal annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 7.299%, consisting of interest on the debentures (5.15% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (2.149% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December 1, 2026. A  holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn October 2024, NEE sold $1.5 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially , a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series O Debenture due November 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than November 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence.

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nPrior to the issuance of NEE's common stock, the stock purchase contracts, if dilutive, will be reflected in NEE's diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of NEE common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any , of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by NEE in the market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, NEECH sold a total of $4.5 billion principal amount of its fixed-rate debentures, with interest rates ranging from 4.85% to 5.90% and maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2055, and $500 million of its floating-rate debentures due in 2028.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, NEECH sold $1.5 billion principal amount of its Series S Junior Subordinated Debentures due A ugust 15, 2055 and $1.0 billion principal amount of its Series T Junior Subordinated Debentures due A ugust 15, 2055, bearing interest at a rate of 6.375% to A ugust 15, 2030 and 6.50% to A ugust 15, 2035, respectively , and thereafter will bear interest based on an underlying index plus a specified margin, reset every five years, provided that the interest rate will not be lower than the respective initial interest rate.",

The  charges  associated  with  these  agreements  are  recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $419 million, $386 million and $316 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $105 million, $108 million and $108 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.\n\n(b) Excludes commitments related to equity contributions and a 20-year natural gas transportation agreement (approximately $70 million per year) with a joint venture, in which NEER has a 31.9% equity investment, that is constructing a natural gas pipeline. These commitments are subject to the completion of construction of the pipeline which has a very low probability of completion. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(c) Includes approximately $370 million of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 9 - Other.\n\n(d) Includes approximately $610 million, $20 million, $5 million, $5 million, $0 million and $5 million for 2022 through 2026 and thereafter, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.\n\nInsurance -  Liability  for  accidents  at  nuclear  power  plants  is  governed  by  the  Price-Anderson Act,  which  limits  the  liability  of  nuclear  reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $450 million of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $100 million private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $13.1 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $963 million ($550 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $143 million ($82 million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $16 million and $20 million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\n\nNEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $2.75 billion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of $1.5 billion for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a limit of $50 million for property damage, decontamination risks and non-nuclear perils. NEE participates in co-insurance of 10% of the first $400 million of losses per site per occurrence, except at Duane Arnold. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $163 million ($104 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $2 million, $2 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\n\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's future storm restoration costs exceed the storm and property insurance reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  loss,  the  amount  of  insurance  available  might  not  be  adequate  to  cover  property  damage  and  other  expenses  incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\n## 16. Segment Information\n\nThe  tables  below  present  information  for  NEE's  and  FPL's  reportable  segments.  NEE's  segments  include  its  reportable  segments,  the  FPL segment, a rate-regulated utility business, and NEER, which is comprised of competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses, as well as an operating segment of NEE, Gulf Power, a rate-regulated utility business.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER had ownership interests in generation, pipeline, and transmission assets, many of which were encumbered by liens, indicating a significant but leveraged investment in these assets. By 2024, NEE's capital expenditure projections show a major decline in planned spending on NEER, from $3,945 million in 2025 to only $370 million thereafter. This indicates a strategic shift away from major capital investment in the NEER segment over time.",

        "Step 3: The significant reduction in planned capital spending indicates a strategic shift or de-emphasis on the NEER segment despite its existing asset base."

Business - NEER for a description of principal properties.\n\n## Character of Ownership\n\nSubstantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. The majority of FPL's real property is held in fee and is free from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions which are not of a nature as to substantially impair the usefulness to FPL of such properties. Some of FPL's electric lines are located on parcels of land which are not owned in fee by FPL but are covered by necessary consents of governmental authorities or rights obtained from owners of private property. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment have ownership interests in entities that own generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission assets and a number of those facilities and assets are encumbered by liens securing various financings. Additionally, the majority of NEER's generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission lines are located on land under easement or leased from owners of private property. See Note 7 - FPL and - NEER.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nWith  regard  to  environmental  proceedings  to  which  a  governmental  authority  is  a  party,  NEE's  and  FPL's  policy  is  to  disclose  any  such proceeding if it is reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to $1 million.\n\nThe Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated to NEER during the fourth quarter of 2021 that its final position is that the act of an eagle flying into a wind turbine that results in the death of the eagle is a crime under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA). The DOJ is investigating eagle fatalities that have occurred in proximity to a number of wind facilities operated by NEER, primarily in the Altamont region of California and in Wyoming, and alleges that the facilities caused eagle fatalities without having a permit in violation of the BGEPA and/or the MBTA. NEER undertakes adaptive management practices designed to avoid and minimize eagle impacts and is working with both the DOJ and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service toward a constructive resolution that would resolve all prior fatalities at wind facilities operated by NEER nationwide, even though federal courts covering large portions of  the  U.S.  have  concluded  that  these  statutes  are  intended  to  cover  only  hunting,  poaching  and  other  intentional  acts  and  do  not  apply  to accidental collisions with wind turbines or other structures, such as airplanes and buildings. NEE anticipates that any such resolution would not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\n\n## Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nNot applicable",

By 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that its total remaining performance obligations for Piedmont amounted to $405 million, with $64 million due in 2025 and decreasing annually until $151 million in 'Thereafter'.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Duke Energy had a direct unsecured debt issuance of $400 million linked to Piedmont, indicating a financial stake or funding relationship.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the relationship is characterized by performance obligations totaling $405 million, showing a transition from debt financing to contractual financial commitments.",
        "Step 3: The change from a debt-based relationship to one based on performance obligations indicates a strategic or structural evolution in how Duke Energy engages financially with Piedmont."

      "answer": "In 2023, Piedmont was allocated 3% of the Duke Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust, indicating a relatively minor stake in the company's broader financial structure. By 2024, Piedmont had $405 million in total remaining performance obligations, with specific annual obligations ranging from $44 million to $64 million. This shift from a stake-based allocation to a more defined and substantial contractual obligation framework suggests a significant evolution in the financial relationship, moving from a proportional share in retirement assets to concrete multi-year performance commitments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported an increase in AFUDC equity income, which contributed to a rise in Other Income and Expenses, net. This helped offset some of the operating revenue declines during the year. However, by 2024, AFUDC equity income had declined to a negative $41 million across all business segments, with Duke Energy Carolinas at $20 million, Progress Energy at $14 million, and Duke Energy Progress at $11 million. This shift from a positive contributor in 2023 to a net expense in 2024 indicates a reversal in the company's equity income from construction-related financing activities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power's derivative liabilities related to options were described as immaterial. By 2024, the company reported $23 million in current and $100 million in total net derivative liabilities. Additionally, the total derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes increased from $42 million in current and $110 million in total liabilities in 2024.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Alabama Power's derivative liabilities were considered immaterial based on the financial statements.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Alabama Power reported specific figures for derivative liabilities, including $23 million in current liabilities and $100 million in total net derivative liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change indicates a significant increase in derivative liabilities and a more detailed disclosure of hedging instruments, showing a transformation in financial exposure and reporting practices."

      "question": "What does the change in Alabama Power's net exposure to energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes from $26M in 2022 to $42M in 2024 suggest about its evolving approach to managing price volatility in compliance with regulatory requirements?",
      "answer": "The increase in Alabama Power's net exposure to energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes indicates a more pronounced reliance on hedging mechanisms to manage price volatility. In 2022, the total exposure was $26 million, with $15 million classified as non-current, suggesting a balanced but relatively conservative hedging strategy. By 2024, the total net exposure rose to $42 million, with a larger proportion ($15 million) still allocated to non-current liabilities, signaling a strategic shift toward stronger protection against long-term price fluctuations. This likely reflects an evolving regulatory environment or internal risk management priorities that emphasize greater financial stability amidst volatile energy markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Alabama Power reported a total net exposure of $26 million in energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes, with $15 million classified as non-current.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, this net exposure increased to $42 million, maintaining a significant portion ($15 million) in non-current liabilities.",
        "Step 3: The increase and continued emphasis on non-current derivatives indicates a strategic evolution toward managing long-term price volatility through enhanced regulatory hedging."

In 2024, the company instead stated that unamortized ITCs 'impact' regulatory liabilities, suggesting a broader, potentially more indirect influence rather than a primary attribution.

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power's derivative liabilities were listed in a table format without specific liability amounts provided, indicating a less detailed disclosure. By 2024, Alabama Power reported $23 million in current liabilities and $100 million in total net derivative liabilities, showing a significant increase in both exposure and transparency. This suggests a more structured and strategic approach to managing regulatory risks through hedging instruments, as evidenced by the increased use of derivatives and more granular reporting. The change in both the magnitude of liabilities and the level of disclosure implies a more active and formalized risk management strategy over time.",

The variance was driven primarily by:\n\n- a $162 million increase in fuel and capacity revenues primarily due to higher retail sales volumes and accelerated recovery of the retired coal units Crystal River 1 and 2;\n- an $83 million increase in retail pricing due to base rate adjustments related to annual increases from the 2017 Settlement Agreement and the solar base rate adjustment;\n- a $25 million increase in other revenues primarily due to lower revenues in the prior year due to the moratorium on customer late payments and service charges in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower outdoor lighting equipment rentals in the prior year, and higher transmission revenues due to prior year customer settlement and the increased network billing rates;\n- a $20 million increase in rider revenues primarily due to increased volumes; and\n- a $12 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes.\n\n## Partially offset by:\n\n- a $140 million decrease in storm revenues due to full recovery of Hurricane Dorian costs in the prior year;\n- a $63 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to unfavorable weather in the current year; and\n- a $22 million decrease in wholesale power revenues, net of fuel, primarily due to a restructured capacity contract.\n\n## Operating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n\n- a $129 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to accelerated depreciation of retired coal units Crystal River 1 and 2 and an increase in plant base;\n- a $69 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices, and outside fuel purchases during a major plant outage at the Hines facility; and\n- a $23 million increase in impairment of assets and other charges to optimize the company's real estate portfolio and reduce office space as parts of the business move to a hybrid and remote workforce strategy.\n\n## Partially offset by:\n\n- an $83 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to decreased storm amortization costs, partially offset by outage maintenance costs at Hines and the timing of Customer Connect costs including training and labor.\n\nOther Income and Expense, net. The increase is primarily due to lower non-service pension costs and gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund.\n\nIncome Tax Expense.

      "answer": "In 2022, Piedmont was explicitly allocated 4% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust as of December 31, 2021, indicating a direct proportional share of retirement obligations. In 2023, Piedmont was no longer mentioned in terms of proportional allocation but instead appeared in the context of the average remaining service period, with a stated six years for Piedmont compared to seven years for other subsidiaries like Duke Energy Carolinas. This represents a shift from a direct financial allocation to an actuarial assumption-based treatment in consolidated reporting.",

The variance was driven primarily by:\n\n- a $129 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to accelerated depreciation of retired coal units Crystal River 1 and 2 and an increase in plant base;\n- a $69 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices, and outside fuel purchases during a major plant outage at the Hines facility; and\n- a $23 million increase in impairment of assets and other charges to optimize the company's real estate portfolio and reduce office space as parts of the business move to a hybrid and remote workforce strategy.\n\n## Partially offset by:\n\n- an $83 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily due to decreased storm amortization costs, partially offset by outage maintenance costs at Hines and the timing of Customer Connect costs including training and labor.\n\nOther Income and Expense, net.

This reflects a shift from a primarily investment-based relationship to one involving direct financial risk exposure tied to operational risks at Georgia Power's nuclear facilities.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's financial stake in Georgia Power evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about its long-term investment strategy in the segment?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's financial stake in Georgia Power decreased significantly from $8 million in 2022 to $2 million in 2023, as reported in the respective 10-K filings. This represents a 75% reduction in just one year. Furthermore, the 2023 filing notes that Georgia Power is subject to a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies, indicating that while the direct financial stake has been reduced, the company remains exposed to potential liabilities tied to Georgia Power's operations. This suggests a strategic shift toward limiting direct capital exposure while maintaining operational involvement in the segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Southern Company reported a $8 million financial stake in Georgia Power as of December 31, 2021, showing its direct capital investment in the segment.",
        "Step 2: By 2023, this stake had dropped to $2 million as of December 31, 2022, reflecting a substantial reduction in direct financial exposure.",
        "Step 3: The significant decrease in the financial stake, combined with the continued exposure to potential NEIL assessments, indicates a strategic evolution where Southern Company is reducing direct capital investment in Georgia Power while still maintaining operational ties."

      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power had $26 million in derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes, split between $11 million current and $15 million non-current. By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current. This indicates a substantial increase in Alabama Power's risk exposure tied to regulatory hedging instruments over the year.",

      "question": "How has Alabama Power's approach to managing financial risk through derivative liabilities evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to its regulatory obligations and long-term asset retirement strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power's disclosures focused heavily on asset retirement obligations (AROs), particularly related to nuclear decommissioning, ash ponds, and asbestos removal, with regulatory liabilities and assets recognized based on state PSC guidance. By 2024, Alabama Power reported a net derivative liability of $23 million (current) and $41 million (non-current) under hedging instruments for regulatory purposes, indicating a new or expanded financial risk management strategy. This evolution suggests a shift toward using derivatives to hedge against regulatory and financial risks tied to long-term obligations like AROs, which were previously managed primarily through regulatory asset and liability mechanisms. The introduction of significant derivative liabilities in 2024 reflects a more active financial hedging approach, likely aimed at stabilizing costs related to future asset retirements and regulatory recovery mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Alabama Power's primary financial obligations were asset retirement liabilities, particularly for nuclear decommissioning and environmental remediation, managed through regulatory assets and liabilities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Alabama Power disclosed new derivative liabilities totaling $64 million (current and non-current combined) under regulatory hedging instruments, indicating a financial strategy shift.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from purely regulatory-based liability management to incorporating financial derivatives as a tool for managing long-term obligations and regulatory cost recovery."

        "In 2023, Alabama Power was reported as a segment of Southern Company with a capital investment of $2,746 million, but there were no specific disclosures regarding derivatives or hedging instruments.",
        "In 2024, Alabama Power had detailed disclosures showing $26 million in total energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes, with $42 million in total liabilities (current and non-current) and $23 million net liabilities recognized on the balance sheet.",
        "The evolution from a general segment reporting in 2023 to detailed derivative liability reporting in 2024 indicates a structural change in how Alabama Power disclosed its hedging instruments, likely reflecting increased regulatory scrutiny or internal transparency requirements."
