These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis.

      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix reported paid net membership additions of 29,529 thousand, a significant 232% increase compared to 2022, indicating rapid subscriber growth. In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Netflix reported a significant increase in paid net membership additions (29,529 thousand), showing a 232% growth compared to the previous year.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Netflix shifted focus in disclosures to foreign exchange hedging strategies, indicating proactive financial risk management for forecasted revenue and content production.",
        "Step 3: The change in disclosure focus from membership growth metrics to hedging strategies suggests a strategic evolution where Netflix is managing the financial risks associated with sustained international membership growth."

These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') and reclassified into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into 'Cost of Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in 'Interest and other income (expense)' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\n## Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency ex change movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company's derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n## 2. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix emphasized the importance of proprietary content and the risks associated with intellectual property, including how unauthorized use could affect the value of its content and amortization strategies. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed financial framework around content amortization, describing it as a complex and subjective process based on historical and estimated viewing patterns. The 2024 filing also noted that if actual viewing patterns differ from estimates, the amortization period or pattern could change, directly affecting financial results. This marks a shift from a risk-focused narrative to a more quantitatively and process-driven discussion of content amortization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, the focus was on the risk of intellectual property infringement affecting the value of content and indirectly influencing amortization assumptions.",
        "In 2024, the company explicitly described the amortization methodology, including the use of estimated viewing patterns and the sensitivity of amortization to changes in those estimates.",
        "The change reflects a shift from qualitative risk disclosure to a more detailed, quantitative explanation of how content amortization is calculated and how it could be impacted by evolving viewing behavior."

For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "In 2023, content amortization was mentioned as part of a list of forward-looking statements, indicating that it was considered in financial projections but without detailed discussion of the estimation methods or auditing challenges. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed explanation of how content amortization is audited, emphasizing the complexity and subjectivity involved due to the reliance on estimated viewing patterns based on both historical and forecasted viewing hours. The 2024 filing also described specific audit procedures, such as sensitivity analyses and comparisons of previous estimates to actual results, to evaluate the impact of assumption changes on amortization timing. This evolution shows a shift from general acknowledgment to a more rigorous and transparent treatment of content amortization assumptions.",

For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "In 2023, content amortization was directly reduced by tax incentives tied to production spend, with these incentives accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets, thereby lowering amortization expenses over the life of the title. By 2024, the focus shifted to the complexity and subjectivity of amortization estimates, emphasizing the reliance on historical and forecasted viewing patterns. The 2024 disclosures highlight increased auditor scrutiny around the assumptions used in amortization modeling, indicating a shift from a tax incentive-driven impact to a more estimation-driven and audit-sensitive process.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, tax incentives were directly reducing the cost basis of content assets, which in turn reduced content amortization over time.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the emphasis shifted to the complexity of amortization estimates based on viewing patterns, with detailed audit procedures addressing the subjectivity and sensitivity of these assumptions.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a tax-driven impact on amortization in 2023 to a more complex, estimation- and audit-driven approach in 2024, indicating an evolution in how content amortization affects financial reporting."

Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "In 2023, the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges was a loss of $120,023 thousand. By 2024, this figure transformed into a significant unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand. This indicates a major shift in Netflix's hedging strategy or exposure, likely involving increased or restructured hedging activity that led to a reversal from a net loss to a substantial net gain over the two years.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the unrealized loss on cash flow hedges was $120,023 thousand, indicating unfavorable movements in hedging instruments.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the position reversed dramatically, showing an unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand, suggesting either a change in market conditions or a strategic increase or restructuring of hedging activities.",
        "Step 3: The change type is 'transformed' with a 'significant' magnitude, reflecting a major evolution in Netflix's exposure or management of cash flow hedges."

      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix reported an Interest and Other Income (Expense) of $(48.772) million, reflecting a net expense primarily due to foreign exchange losses. In contrast, 2024 showed a significant turnaround with Interest and Other Income (Expense) amounting to $266.776 million, indicating a net income. This shift from a net expense to a net income suggests a strong improvement in Netflix's financial positioning, likely due to better foreign exchange management or increased interest income.",

      "answer": "In 2023, content amortization was $14,197,437 thousand, and in 2024, it increased to $15,301,517 thousand. This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How did the treatment and impact of certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of their recognition and influence on Netflix's income tax provision?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix explicitly stated that it did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes, adhering to the 'more likely than not' threshold for recognition based on technical merits. By 2024, while the Company still maintained a policy of not recognizing such benefits unless the criteria were met, the relationship shifted to a 'Negatively Impacts' stance, suggesting that the existence or unresolved status of these uncertain tax positions had a demonstrable negative effect on the tax provision or financial position during the year. This evolution indicates that although Netflix maintained its conservative recognition policy, the financial impact of unresolved uncertain tax positions became more pronounced in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company explicitly stated it did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions and provided a detailed explanation of its accounting policy regarding tax benefits and uncertain positions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company maintained the same recognition policy but the relationship with the tax benefits shifted to 'Negatively Impacts', indicating a material effect on financials due to unresolved uncertain tax positions.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a neutral stance of non-recognition in 2023 to a recognition of a negative financial impact in 2024, suggesting increased exposure or scrutiny related to these uncertain tax positions."

The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix  service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company's advertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising ex penses were $1,779 million, $1,732 million and $1,586 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax  rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax  assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\n\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using ex change rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders' equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were $(18) million, $(293) million, and $282 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2024 were net of hedging impacts. No hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in 'Other current assets' and 'Other non-current assets') or liabilities (presented in 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' and 'Other non-current liabilities') on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Cash flow hedges",

      "answer": "In 2023, content amortization contributed a $171 million increase in cost of revenues compared to 2022, reflecting higher amortization costs related to both existing and new content. By 2024, the focus shifted to the complexity and subjectivity of amortization methodology, which is based on estimated viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 disclosure highlights the auditing challenges and sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate potential changes in amortization due to variations in assumptions, indicating a more detailed and risk-focused approach compared to the prior year's emphasis on cost increases.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

However, in 2023, this metric decreased to $7.64, a drop of $0.86 or 10% compared to 2022. This reversal indicates a notable shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or market dynamics, potentially due to competitive pressures, content changes, or adjustments in regional pricing models.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from an upward trend in 2022 to a decline in 2023 indicates a reversal in revenue per membership, suggesting changes in pricing strategy or external market factors."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues grew by 7% compared to the prior year, and the operating margin stood at 18%. In 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained consistent at 7%, while the operating margin improved to 21%. This indicates that despite a similar pace of revenue growth, Netflix enhanced its profitability through better cost management or operational efficiencies.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 41,033 thousand, representing a 44% growth, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership dropped to $7.64, a decrease of 20%. Despite the decline in per-user revenue, the significant increase in average paying memberships contributed to a $193,506 thousand rise in total revenue from $3,266,601 thousand in 2022 to $3,763,727 thousand in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the 11% growth in average paying memberships and a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported paid net membership additions of 1,279 thousand, reflecting a significant decrease compared to the previous year. However, in 2023, the company experienced a strong rebound with paid net membership additions rising to 4,298 thousand, representing a 147% increase from 2022. This turnaround indicates a substantial improvement in Netflix's subscriber growth trajectory over the two-year period.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a transformation from a steep decline to robust growth, signaling a significant positive shift in the company's subscriber acquisition performance."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a decrease in paid net membership additions of 1,738 thousand compared to the prior year, continuing a downward trend from 7,140 thousand in 2021. However, in 2023, the company saw a significant turnaround with a 147% increase in paid net membership additions, adding 4,298 thousand new memberships compared to 2022. This indicates a strong recovery and positive shift in the company's growth trajectory after a period of membership stagnation and decline.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Netflix experienced a decrease in paid net membership additions, reporting only 1,738 thousand compared to 2021, showing continued weakening from 7,140 thousand in 2021 vs 2020.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Netflix reversed this trend, achieving 4,298 thousand paid net membership additions, representing a 147% increase compared to 2022.",
        "Step 3: The change from a declining trend in 2022 to a significant increase in 2023 represents a transformation in membership growth, indicating a strategic or market shift that benefited the company."

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion.

Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equitylinked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\n## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2021, we had the equivalent of $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding ('Notes'), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n- make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n- limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- increase our cost of borrowing;\n- limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n- limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n- increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $9.56, while in 2023 it decreased to $8.66. This represents a decline in the average revenue generated per membership, suggesting a potential shift in the company's pricing strategy or a change in the mix of membership plans offered. The decrease could also indicate efforts to attract more subscribers by offering lower-cost plans, as evidenced by the increase in paid memberships at the end of the period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $14.56, showing a 9% increase compared to the previous year. By 2023, this metric had significantly declined to $8.66, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year. This sharp drop indicates a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or market dynamics, such as a move toward more affordable plans, increased competition, or changes in regional pricing structures.",

        "Step 3: The significant decrease in average monthly revenue per membership from $14.56 in 2022 to $8.66 in 2023 indicates a transformation in Netflix's pricing or market approach."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average of 40,000 thousand paying memberships with an average monthly revenue per membership of $8.48. By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66. This indicates that Netflix experienced both subscriber growth and a modest increase in pricing, likely reflecting a combination of successful market expansion and strategic price adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Average paying memberships were 40,000 thousand with an average monthly revenue of $8.48.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) - Average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, and average monthly revenue per membership rose to $8.66.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The increase in both average paying memberships and revenue per membership suggests a dual success in subscriber growth and pricing strategy."

A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. V oluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ('Open Connect') to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix indicated that content amortization was influenced by both historical and estimated viewing patterns, with an emphasis on forward-looking projections tied to content performance. By 2023, the company had placed a more structured emphasis on auditing and validating these amortization estimates, incorporating sensitivity analyses and comparing prior estimates with actual viewing results to refine the accuracy of amortization modeling. This reflects a shift from a primarily projection-based approach to a more data-driven and auditable process.",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How did the amortization of content assets and related cash payments evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about Netflix's content investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported that amortization of content assets increased from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, a 13% increase, while payments for content assets rose significantly by $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million. This large increase in content payments compared to amortization was attributed to production delays from the pandemic shifting payments into 2022 and higher operating expenses due to international expansion. In 2023, although amortization remained a dominant component of cost of revenues, the focus shifted to operational efficiency and global content delivery optimization, with no mention of significant increases in content payments. This suggests a strategic shift from aggressive content spending to a more balanced approach emphasizing delivery infrastructure and cost control.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Netflix experienced a 13% increase in amortization of content assets and a much larger 39% increase in payments for content assets, indicating aggressive investment and pandemic-related delays.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, amortization remained a major cost, but there was no mention of a similar surge in content payments; instead, emphasis was placed on cost efficiency, Open Connect delivery network, and global operations.",
        "Step 3: The shift from rapid content spending growth in 2022 to a more measured and operationally efficient approach in 2023 indicates a strategic evolution in how Netflix is managing its content asset investments and related costs."

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

      "answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million, primarily due to more exclusive and original programming, and it had a direct impact on cost of revenues, which decreased as a percentage of revenue (from 61% to 58%) due to delayed content releases from the pandemic. In 2023, the complexity and subjectivity of content amortization were emphasized, particularly due to the reliance on estimated viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more detailed audit controls to evaluate the amortization method, assumptions, and data accuracy, indicating a shift toward more rigorous oversight and recognition of the financial significance of amortization estimates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, content amortization increased significantly ($1,423 million), directly affecting cost of revenues and showing a relative slowdown compared to revenue growth due to pandemic-related delays.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the focus shifted to the complexity and subjectivity of amortization estimates, with detailed audit procedures implemented to validate assumptions and data used in forecasting viewing patterns.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a primarily quantitative increase in amortization in 2022 to a more qualitative and control-intensive approach in 2023, indicating increased financial and operational scrutiny of content amortization."

A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. V oluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ('Open Connect') to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n",

These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix\u2019s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments.

Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equitylinked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\n## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2021, we had the equivalent of $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding ('Notes'), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n- make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n- limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- increase our cost of borrowing;\n- limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n- limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n- increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 11% growth in average paying memberships compared to the prior year, contributing to a 19% increase in consolidated revenues. By 2024, the growth rate of average paying memberships had slowed to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 in 2023 to 277,730 in 2024), yet streaming revenues still grew by 16% year-over-year. This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Netflix experienced an 11% growth in average paying memberships, which was a key driver of the 19% revenue increase.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the growth rate in average paying memberships had increased to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 to 277,730), yet the revenue growth was slightly lower at 16%.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift where revenue growth remains robust despite a moderation in membership growth, suggesting improved monetization efficiency or pricing power."

          "chunk_text": "\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the 11% growth in average paying memberships and a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported Paid Net Membership Additions of 2,693 thousand, a significant decrease from 12,084 thousand in 2023, representing a sharp decline in growth. However, by 2024, Paid Net Membership Additions rebounded slightly to 12,320 thousand, indicating a recovery in membership growth. This pattern shows a transformation from a period of contraction in 2022 to stabilization and modest growth in 2024, reflecting shifts in the company's market dynamics and competitive positioning.",

This represents a decrease of over 54%, indicating a major shift in Netflix's subscriber base and suggesting a contraction in its global streaming membership that requires deeper analysis into churn, market saturation, or strategic changes in content or pricing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported average paying memberships of 73,904 thousand and an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $10.99, contributing to a streaming revenue of $9,745,015 thousand. By 2024, average paying memberships had increased to 94,200 thousand, a growth of 16%, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership slightly declined to $10.96. Despite the minor decrease in per-member revenue, streaming revenues grew significantly to $12,387,035 thousand in 2024, representing a 17% increase compared to 2023. This indicates that the growth in paying memberships was the primary driver of revenue expansion, offsetting the small drop in average monthly revenue per member.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change over time, noting that membership growth was significant (16%) while per-member revenue slightly declined, yet overall streaming revenue increased due to the larger membership base."

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31,",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix emphasized the complexity and subjectivity involved in estimating content amortization, which is based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns, and noted that changes in these patterns could affect amortization timing. By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company highlighted the complexity and subjectivity of amortization estimates based on viewing patterns, without specific quantification of external factors like tax incentives.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Netflix explicitly disclosed the financial impact of tax incentives on content amortization, showing a consistent and increasing reduction over the three-year period (including 2022, 2023, and 2024).",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from qualitative risk disclosure to a more quantitative and strategic financial disclosure regarding how external incentives influence amortization costs."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix highlighted the forward-looking nature of content amortization as part of a broader set of financial and strategic uncertainties, noting its dependence on estimated viewing patterns which could impact financial performance. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results\u2014indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, content amortization was mentioned as a forward-looking financial metric subject to risks based on estimated viewing patterns.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, content amortization was described in detail, including audit procedures, controls, and sensitivity analyses performed by the auditor to validate the assumptions and data used.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how Netflix manages and discloses content amortization\u2014from a general risk factor to a more transparent and audited financial process."

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "In 2022, the amortization of content assets was $14,026,132, and by 2024, it increased to $15,301,517. This indicates that Netflix has been consistently amortizing a growing amount of content assets over this period, suggesting a sustained or even accelerating investment in content. The steady rise in amortization expense reflects the company's ongoing strategy to expand its content library, which supports its global subscriber growth and competitive positioning in the streaming market.",

A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. V oluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ('Open Connect') to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment.

We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, with an additional note that off-balance sheet streaming content commitments were significant but not quantified. The company expressed concern about the long-term and fixed cost nature of these obligations, which could limit flexibility and increase liquidity risk if revenue growth underperforms. By 2024, Netflix continued to highlight content obligations as a key risk, but the focus shifted toward the complexity of future commitments, including obligations for unknown future titles under agreements like traditional film output deals. While the 2024 report did not provide a specific dollar figure for off-balance sheet obligations, it acknowledged that these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant,' indicating a continued but more nuanced liquidity risk tied to forward-looking content commitments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported 221,844 thousand paid memberships at the end of the period, reflecting steady growth compared to previous years. By 2024, this figure had declined significantly to 89,625 thousand paid memberships at end of period. This indicates a major shift in the company's subscriber acquisition trend, moving from a pattern of consistent growth to a period of contraction or stabilization, potentially due to market saturation or strategic changes in content or pricing.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the number of paid memberships at end of period was 221,844 thousand, showing strong growth.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the number of paid memberships at end of period had dropped to 89,625 thousand, indicating a significant decrease.",
        "Step 3: The change from growth in 2022 to a decline by 2024 shows a transformation in the trend of paid memberships, suggesting a strategic or market-driven shift."

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 19% increase in streaming revenues, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67. By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues increased by 19%, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had decreased to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had fallen to $10.96.",
        "Step 3: The slight decline in average monthly revenue per membership, despite continued revenue growth, suggests a strategic shift, possibly due to pricing adjustments or changes in consumer behavior."

      "answer": "In 2022, payments for content assets increased by $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, primarily driven by delays in production due to the pandemic and increased operating expenses. In 2024, payments for content assets also increased, though at a slower rate, rising $3,862 million from $13,140 million to $17,003 million, and this increase was noted as a partial offset to otherwise favorable operating cash flow trends. This indicates that while Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, the growth rate of these payments slowed, suggesting a more measured or stabilizing investment approach by 2024.",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

      "answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "In 2022, Interest and Other Income (Expense) was positively impacted by a $403 million foreign exchange gain, primarily driven by the remeasurement of Senior Notes denominated in euros. By 2024, this metric had shifted significantly, showing a much smaller net income of $266,776 thousand from interest and other income (expense), indicating a reduction in the positive impact of foreign exchange movements. This evolution suggests that foreign exchange gains, which were a key driver in 2022, played a diminished role in 2024, with the overall financial contribution from this line item becoming more neutral or potentially volatile.",

        "Step 1: Identify the state of Interest and Other Income (Expense) in 2022, which was significantly increased due to a $403 million foreign exchange gain.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a transformation from a strong positive influence in 2022 to a more neutral or minor contribution in 2024, indicating a shift in the financial dynamics related to currency remeasurement."

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

      "answer": "In 2022, NFLX's audit disclosure emphasized testing the controls over management's review of the content amortization method and significant assumptions, including historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, with a focus on comparing previous estimates to actual results and performing sensitivity analyses. By 2024, the disclosure maintained similar core procedures but placed a more pronounced emphasis on the evaluation of forecasted viewing hour consumption by explicitly linking it to current viewing trends and operating information, suggesting a heightened focus on forward-looking assumptions in response to potential volatility in viewing behavior. This evolution indicates a strategic refinement in the way assumptions underlying content amortization are scrutinized over time.",

        "In 2022, the audit procedures included testing the assumptions behind estimated viewing patterns, comparing previous estimates to actual results, and performing sensitivity analyses.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

The rate of increase, however, slowed between 2022 and 2023 (from $14,026,132 to $14,197,437, an increase of $171,305 thousand) compared to the increase between 2023 and 2024 (from $14,197,437 to $15,301,517, an increase of $1,104,080 thousand).

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV  series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n## Non-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400 million, which is expected to increase over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NFLX reported total content obligations of $23,161,360, with $10,019,306 due in the next 12 months and $13,142,054 beyond that period. By 2024, while no direct numerical update was provided, the company disclosed qualitative changes in how it accounts for content obligations, including more nuanced treatment of non-cancelable commitments, licensing of future titles, and obligations tied to creative talent agreements. This indicates a shift from purely quantitative disclosure to a more strategic and forward-looking explanation of content liabilities, suggesting increased complexity in content acquisition and production planning.",

By 2024, the company continued to disclose its streaming revenues in detail, noting that foreign exchange hedging activities had a direct impact on revenue figures, with hedging gains of $124 million specifically included in 'Streaming revenues' for that year.

      "question": "How did Disney's postretirement medical cost expectations evolve from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, particularly in terms of projected net benefit and amortization factors?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a $81 million net benefit for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, reflecting a $428 million decrease driven by lower amortization of deferred losses.",
        "Step 2: In fiscal 2023, the company attributed changes in postretirement medical costs to the amortization of prior-year service credits related to benefit option modifications and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how Disney manages and projects postretirement medical costs, shifting from a near-term net benefit to an expectation of negligible costs in the medium term, indicating a strategic and financial evolution in handling these obligations."

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney fully consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements that gave it control over day-to-day operations and strategic decisions, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks based on management agreements that provided operational control, despite less than 50% equity ownership.",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks.
