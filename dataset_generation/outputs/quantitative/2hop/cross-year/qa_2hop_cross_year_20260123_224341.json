      "question": "How has the valuation methodology and disclosure around Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of measurement basis and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, measured at cost with no changes mentioned during the year. The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, nonmarketable investments were listed at $5 million and categorized under 'other measurement basis' without further explanation of valuation methods or risk.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company provided a detailed explanation that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes or impairments and are composed of venture capital funds and nonmarketable securities, along with a broader discussion of counterparty risk.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a minimal disclosure approach in 2023 to a more detailed and risk-focused disclosure in 2024, indicating increased transparency and a more structured valuation methodology."

Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equiv alents, short-term inv estments and accounts receiv able. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash inv estments in inv estment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial deriv ativ e contracts to financial institutions with inv estment-grade ratings.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receiv able are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentiv es and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receiv able on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounts receiv able allowances changed to reflect amounts charged to operating results by $5 million, $3 million and $5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## 6. Valuation of debt and equity inv estments and certain liabilities\n\n## Investments measured at fair value\n\nMoney market funds, debt inv estments and mutual funds are stated at fair v alue, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. We classify all debt inv estments as av ailable-for-sale. See Fair-value considerations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&amp;E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nOur mutual funds hold a v ariety of debt and equity inv estments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair v alue of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Other investments\n\nOur other inv estments include equity-method inv estments and nonmarketable inv estments, which are not measured at fair v alue. These inv estments consist of interests in v enture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Gains and losses from equity-method inv estments are recognized in OI&amp;E based on our ownership share of the inv estee's financial results. Nonmarketable securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observ able changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on nonmarketable inv estments are recognized in OI&amp;E.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of activ ely traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curv e constructed with an appropriate univ erse of high-quality corporate bonds av ailable in each country.

      "answer": "In 2023, the Embedded Processing segment had a goodwill value of $172 million, indicating its relatively smaller asset base compared to other segments. By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions. The rise from a segment with modest goodwill to one generating a significant portion of revenue reflects a meaningful evolution in its importance to TXN's overall business model.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the U.S. Defined Benefit plan had a target asset allocation of 65% - 80% in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, indicating a conservative investment approach aimed at stabilizing the plan's funded status. By 2024, the projected benefit payments for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan decreased from $80 million in 2025 to $54 million in 2029, showing a consistent downward trend in expected near-term obligations. This suggests that the company may have taken steps to reduce or hedge its long-term pension liabilities, aligning with a strategic shift in liability management.",

Operational efficiency was described as striving for more output per dollar spent, focusing on impactful investments to maximize free cash flow per share growth. By 2024, the company maintained its strategic focus on free cash flow per share as the ultimate performance metric but shifted emphasis toward strengthening competitive advantages through targeted investments, while continuing to highlight efficiency as a core principle. The 2024 discussion reinforced the importance of long-term growth in free cash flow per share but did not reference specific capital allocation figures, suggesting a more qualitative reaffirmation of prior strategies rather than introducing new quantitative commitments.",

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share ov er the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitiv e adv antages. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are powerful in combination and prov ide tangible benefits:\n2. (a)    A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that prov ides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n3. (b)    A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more v alue for our inv estments.\n4. (c)    T he reach of our market channels that giv es access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and giv es us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n5. (d)    Div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions that prov ide less single point dependency and longer returns on our inv estments.\n\nTogether, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitiv e adv antages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate v alue.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our rev enue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are ev idenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to hav e a significant impact on our rev enue in any giv en period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our rev enue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed that its expected long-term rate of return assumptions were based on future expectations for returns by asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. By 2024, the company clarified that it actively rebalances the plans' investments specifically when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a more defined and action-oriented approach to asset management. This reflects a shift from a general disclosure of rebalancing practices to a more prescriptive and rule-based strategy tied directly to the target ranges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, TXN described the use of target asset allocation ranges in setting return expectations and noted periodic rebalancing as part of the investment strategy.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, TXN specified that rebalancing occurs when investments are 'outside the target allocation ranges,' indicating a more structured and reactive process.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a transformation in how target allocation ranges are used \u2014 from a general assumption framework in 2023 to a trigger mechanism for rebalancing in 2024."

      "answer": "In 2023, customer inventory adjustments were listed among several risk factors that the company 'faces,' indicating a general exposure to demand fluctuations without emphasizing a direct or material impact. By 2024, the language evolved to state that such adjustments 'may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition,' signaling a heightened concern or observed impact. This shift suggests that customer inventory adjustments have become a more pressing risk, reflecting increased volatility in customer behavior or market conditions affecting TXN\u2019s operational predictability.",

        "In 2023, customer inventory adjustments were mentioned as one of many risks the company 'faces,' indicating a general risk exposure.",

These ev ents could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our or our customers', suppliers', and other third parties' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations (including our online serv ices, platforms and transactions); result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adv ersely affect our operating results and our reputation.

      "answer": "In 2023, TI emphasized its ability to utilize manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover fixed operating costs, despite the challenges of a competitive and cyclical industry. By 2024, the company noted that fixed operating costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and that increased capital expenditures and depreciation from planned capacity expansions have heightened the risk that these fixed costs could adversely affect profit margins. This indicates a shift from optimism about cost coverage to concern about the financial impact of fixed costs under fluctuating demand.",

In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the v alue of related inv entory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be av ailable or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotiv e applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Improper, incorrect, illicit or unauthorized storage, handling, modification, div ersion or use of our products, or use of counterfeit products, by third parties could result in reputational harm. Any of these ev ents could adv ersely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\n## Our results of operations could be adv ersely affected by distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance.\n\nIn 2024, about 20% of our rev enue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products ov er our products. Moreov er, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptiv e or harmful to our business.\n\n## Our margins v ary.\n\nOur profit margins v ary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment v olume; capital expenditures and resulting depreciation; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inv entory lev els; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitiv e market env ironment that might adv ersely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. With our planned capacity expansions, capital expenditures and depreciation hav e increased. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adv ersely affect profit margins as a result.\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.\n\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations on an international, national and local lev el that affect our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the env ironment and climate change; safety; health; trade, including import and export; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data priv acy and protection; labor and employment; competition; facilities and code compliance; market access; pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the mov ement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensiv e and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. From time to time, we receiv e inquiries from gov ernment entities regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, and we could be subject to related litigation, inv estigations or enforcement activ ity that can be unpredictable and time-consuming, as well as disruptions to our operations, or significant fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.\n\nIncreased focus from gov ernment authorities, inv estors, customers and other key stakeholders on env ironmental, social and gov ernance (ESG) matters has led to new and more stringent reporting standards and disclosure requirements. As the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we might hav e to undertake costly efforts to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure, or perceiv ed failure, to achiev e stated goals or meet stakeholder expectations and standards could adv ersely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $633 million, with additions of $162 million and write-offs of $148 million. By 2024, the allowance decreased to $577 million, with additions of $122 million and write-offs of $199 million. This indicates a decreasing trend in the allowance balance, with a shift toward higher write-offs relative to additions in the later year.",

      "question": "How did IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's credit risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent ended the year at $28 million, with additions of $6 million and a deduction of $2 million from foreign currency adjustments. By 2024, the noncurrent allowance decreased to $19 million, with deductions of $7 million and a further $1 million reduction due to foreign currency effects. This represents a consistent downward trend in the allowance, indicating that IBM's exposure to credit losses on noncurrent receivables has decreased over this period. The reductions suggest either improved credit quality of receivables or a strategic shift in credit risk management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent ended at $28 million, with $6 million added during the year and a $2 million adjustment from foreign currency.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent was $19 million, with $7 million deducted and a $1 million foreign currency adjustment.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both years, the allowance decreased from $28 million to $19 million, indicating a reduction in credit risk exposure or tighter credit controls."

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Current started at $418 million and increased to $467 million by the end of 2023. However, in 2024, the balance decreased significantly to $254 million from $431 million at the beginning of the year. This indicates a volatile assessment of credit risk, with an initial increase followed by a substantial reduction, potentially reflecting improved credit quality or more aggressive write-offs during the period.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in 2022 - The Allowance For Credit Losses - Current ended at $418 million.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in 2024 - The Allowance For Credit Losses - Current ended at $254 million after starting the year at $431 million.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The allowance initially increased in 2023 but saw a significant decrease in 2024, indicating a notable shift in IBM's credit risk exposure or policy."

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include the increased risk and cost of remediation due to industry-wide incidents like MOVEit, indicating a heightened financial exposure. The introduction of generative AI as a novel attack vector in 2024 further underscores the evolving complexity and potential increase in remediation costs, suggesting a growing financial risk compared to 2022.",

Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time. The  company's products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in artificial intelligence, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fastpaced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities with the potential for exploitation, and while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate such events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future.\n\nAs a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company's business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations,",

By 2024, the beginning balance was $431 million, which declined to an ending balance of $254 million after additions of $13 million, significant write-offs of $146 million, and a $20 million negative adjustment for foreign currency and other factors. This represents a substantial decrease in the Allowance for Credit Losses - Current over the two-year period.",

      "question": "How has IBM's exposure to pension-related risks affecting its financial flexibility evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of potential liquidity impacts due to market downturns?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM noted that an extended financial market downturn could require the company to provide incremental pension plan funding, resulting in liquidity risk that could negatively impact financial flexibility. By 2024, this risk remained present, with IBM continuing to highlight the potential for adverse financial market conditions to unfavorably impact pension trust assets and future liabilities, with similar exposure to liquidity risk from incremental funding requirements. While the core risk remained stable, the emphasis in 2024 shifted slightly to include broader references to global economic activity, suggesting a more generalized concern rather than a specific increase or decrease in risk magnitude.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, IBM explicitly stated that extended market downturns could lead to incremental pension funding and liquidity risk, directly impacting financial flexibility.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, IBM maintained the same core risk related to pension funding and liquidity, but the context expanded to include global economic activity, without indicating a material change in the risk level.",
        "Step 3: The risk related to pension funding and financial flexibility remained stable in nature, with no significant increase or decrease, but showed a slight evolution in framing and context."

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to the Spin-Off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc.\n\nIf the Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. Spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, it could result in substantial tax liability for the Company and its stockholders: In connection with the spin-off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc., the company obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion from its tax advisor, in each case to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. and the company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, the conclusions reached in the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion could be jeopardized. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the company's stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.",

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

By 2024, the company reiterated this risk but placed additional emphasis on broader strategic transformation efforts, including the use of automation and AI to drive productivity and growth.

The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use or the value of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe Company's Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.\n\nProduct and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results.\n\nThe Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations, financial results and reputation.\n\nThe Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.",

Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

      "answer": "In 2022, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans was 1.57% for 2021 and 1.31% for 2020, while the long-term pay progression was consistently 3.15%. By 2023, the company projected increasing financial obligations for Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans, with payments expected to rise from $88 million in 2024 to $95 million in 2028, totaling $501 million from 2029 to 2033.

The increase in the discount rate from 2021 (2.74%) to 2024 (implied by the liability projection context) likely contributed to a lower present value of obligations, indicating a strategic reduction in expected future liabilities for retiree healthcare.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2021, we generated $18.34 billion of revenue.\n\nFor decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications, particularly in industrial and automotive markets.\n\nFor many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Over a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021, we allocated $79 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, which includes investments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. In this period we allocated just over $8 billion to capital expenditures, and in the years ahead this amount will increase, as we expect it to be the largest driver of long-term free cash flow growth. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. This is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost-cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth, improved gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

In 2023, the description remained largely the same, but the language shifted from 'a present value is developed' to 'simulate a portfolio that would provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan's expected benefit payments when due' in the U.S. context, indicating a more explicit alignment of the U.S. and non-U.S. methodologies.

The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan's expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value.

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company disclosed that it rebalances investments when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a reactive approach.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a basic rebalancing policy in 2022 to a more comprehensive and forward-looking asset allocation framework in 2023 reflects a strategic shift in how Texas Instruments manages its defined benefit plan investments."

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan was described as an option for employees who elected not to continue accruing benefits in the defined benefit pension plans, as well as for employees hired between November 1997 and December 31, 2003. It included a fixed employer contribution of 2% of annual eligible earnings plus a matching contribution of up to 4%. In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%. This represents a narrowing of benefits for newer hires.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan included both a fixed 2% employer contribution and a matching contribution of up to 4% for employees hired through December 31, 2003.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in the employer contribution framework, reducing the generosity of the plan for employees hired after a specific date."

Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $38 million and $36 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2021 and 2020 were not material.\n\nEffects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets\n\nExpenses related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows:\n\n",

In 2023, while the same four competitive advantages were reiterated, the specific mention of R&D project selection and development of new capabilities like TI.com was omitted from the capital allocation section.

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.\n\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:\n- i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.\n- ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.\n- iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.\n- iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.\n\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.\n\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&amp;A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:\n\n- Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.\n- When we discuss our results:\n- Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.\n- New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.\n- From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the 'mix' of products shipped.",

Postretirement benefit plans\n\n## Plan descriptions\n\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.\n\n## U.S. retirement plans\n\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan.\n\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee's annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees' elections, TI's U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $1.16 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.\n\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $63 million in 2021 and $61 million in 2020 and 2019.",

      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, IBM cited 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a risk, focusing on overall demand for its products and solutions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, IBM reiterated the same risk but expanded the description to include a 'shift in client buying patterns' as an additional trigger for potential revenue impact.",
        "Step 3: The addition of 'shift in client buying patterns' in 2024 indicates a qualitative evolution in how IBM perceives its exposure to client spending budgets, reflecting changes in client behavior that could affect IBM's business."

If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.\n\nDamage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. IBM's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompany's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact the company's financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.",

In 2024, the same phrasing was used, indicating that the risk factor remained consistent and no material changes were made to how IBM assessed or disclosed this risk.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, IBM's valuation and qualifying accounts were referenced in a table format on page 19 under Schedule II, indicating a structured but potentially less prominent placement within the document. In 2024, the valuation and qualifying accounts section was given a standalone heading on page 29, accompanied by a clear temporal label specifying the years ended December 31, with an explicit mention of financial units in millions. This evolution suggests that IBM placed greater emphasis on transparency and clarity in its financial disclosures over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the valuation reserves were disclosed in a table under Schedule II on page 19, suggesting a more integrated and less highlighted format.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, the reserves were given a dedicated section heading on page 29, with explicit time references and a note on financial units, indicating a more prominent and structured presentation.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from a table within a schedule to a standalone section with clear labeling represents a transformation in how IBM presented its valuation and qualifying accounts, signaling an intent to enhance clarity and focus in financial reporting."

      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, IBM disclosed Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves covering the years 2023, 2022, and 2021. In the 2024 filing, the company disclosed the same category covering the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This indicates a shift in the reporting window, with the inclusion of the most recent year (2024) and the exclusion of the oldest year (2021), consistent with a rolling three-year disclosure approach.",

A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:\n\n## Software:\n\nThe depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. Our hybrid cloud and AI platforms allow clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in this segment include: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and Splunk. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments.\n\n## Consulting:\n\nConsulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration, application development, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.\n\n## Infrastructure:\n\nIBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and AI workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device manufacturers (ODMs) who provide systems that are rebranded. Further, cloud service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer additional routes to market for server and storage systems.\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM clients' acquisition of hardware, software and services. Financing's ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flex ibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with noncaptive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'ex pects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar ex pressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 9 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM highlighted that it has historically experienced lower revenue in the first quarter compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter. Additionally, both filings note that the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter\u2014particularly at the end of the fourth quarter\u2014makes financial results for a given period difficult to predict. This suggests that IBM's first-quarter revenue pattern and the associated challenge in financial predictability remained stable between the two years, with no significant change in the magnitude or impact of this seasonal trend.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - IBM noted historically lower first-quarter revenue compared to the prior fourth quarter and cited end-of-quarter product ordering spikes as a factor in unpredictable financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompany's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact the company's financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.",

      "answer": "In 2023, IBM disclosed that during an extended financial market downturn, it could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding, which would pose liquidity risk and negatively impact financial flexibility. In 2024, the company repeated the same language regarding potential incremental pension funding requirements under similar conditions, indicating no substantive change in its exposure to pension-related liquidity risk. While the qualitative risk remained consistent, there is no explicit quantitative disclosure in either year that indicates a change in the magnitude of potential funding obligations.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, IBM stated that adverse financial market conditions could lead to incremental pension funding requirements, which would negatively impact liquidity and financial flexibility.",

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "question": "How has the potential financial impact of IBM's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on the company's liquidity and financial flexibility evolved from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that adverse financial market conditions could unfavorably impact the value of pension trust assets and future pension liabilities, potentially requiring incremental pension plan funding and creating liquidity risk. The document referenced IBM\u2019s 2023 Annual Report for details on pension funding assumptions. In 2024, the company reiterated similar concerns, again emphasizing the risk of incremental pension funding during extended market downturns and the potential for significant increases in mandatory pension insolvency insurance premiums outside the U.S. However, the 2024 disclosure included a more explicit reference to the company's financial flexibility being negatively impacted by these pension-related liquidity risks. This indicates a continued but more explicitly articulated concern about the impact of pension obligations on liquidity and financial flexibility in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, IBM noted that adverse market conditions could negatively impact pension trust assets and liabilities, potentially requiring incremental funding and affecting liquidity.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, IBM maintained similar concerns but more explicitly tied pension funding risks to financial flexibility, indicating a heightened emphasis on the potential impact.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The core risk remained consistent, but the framing evolved to emphasize the broader implications for financial flexibility, suggesting a qualitative evolution rather than a quantitative change."

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions.

The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities.

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-TabulatingRecording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 12.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 12 to 14.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 14 to 15.\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nWe proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.\n\nCompanies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

This indicates that IBM maintained a consistent audit timeline, completing the audit of the financial statement schedule just before the end of February in both years, with only a one-day shift in the exact date of the report. The consistency in timing suggests stable and predictable audit processes across these two reporting years.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-TabulatingRecording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 12.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 12 to 14.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 14 to 15.\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nWe proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients' complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others.\n\nCompanies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors.\n\nOur principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future.\n\nOur breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing.",

      "question": "How has IBM's exposure to regulatory risks in international markets evolved in relation to the potential impairment of its intangible assets, based on the specific risks disclosed in its 2023 and 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that international trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions could affect its ability to move goods and services across borders or impose added costs, which could indirectly impact the economic benefit derived from acquired intangible assets, thus increasing the risk of impairment. In 2024, this exposure expanded as IBM noted additional regulatory risks, such as outbound investment restrictions and evolving AI and cloud regulations, which further complicate its global operations. These new risks increase the uncertainty around the valuation and utility of IBM\u2019s intangible assets, particularly in markets where regulatory environments are shifting rapidly, thereby heightening the potential for impairment charges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, IBM identified trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions as risks that could impair its operational efficiency and indirectly affect the value of its intangible assets.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, IBM expanded its risk disclosure to include outbound investment restrictions and evolving AI and cloud regulations, which directly affect how it leverages its intangible assets globally.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from general trade risks to more specific regulatory risks indicates a growing concern around the stability and valuation of intangible assets due to increasing regulatory complexity."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",
