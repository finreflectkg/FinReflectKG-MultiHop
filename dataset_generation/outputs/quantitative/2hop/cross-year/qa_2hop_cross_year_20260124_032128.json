By 2023, this figure surged to $13,219 million, or 87.2% of sales\u2014an increase of 309% in absolute terms. This dramatic rise was primarily driven by a one-time gain related to the Copeland note receivable and changes in restructuring costs, interest income, and other deductions. However, this was followed by a sharp decline in 2024, where net earnings dropped to $1,968 million, or 11.2% of sales, reflecting an 85% decrease from 2023. This post-event correction suggests the 2023 spike was largely non-recurring.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $3,231 million, which significantly increased to $13,219 million in 2023. This substantial growth in earnings directly contributed to retained earnings, which rose from a beginning balance of $28,053 million in 2022 to $40,070 million in 2023 before dividends and other adjustments. The change reflects a transformational increase in profitability or a one-time gain, likely tied to strategic transactions such as the AspenTech acquisition disclosed in the 2023 filing.",

The transaction will be subject to regulatory and government approvals, and other customary closing conditions. Emerson will work closely with the local Russia management group to help ensure a smooth transition for employees through the sale process.\n\nIn 2022, the Company acquired three other businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the AspenTech segment, for $130, net of cash acquired. The three businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $40.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Open Systems International, Inc. (OSI), a leading operations technology software provider in the global power industry, for approximately $1.6 billion, net of cash acquired. This business, which had net sales of $191 in fiscal 2021 and is reported in the AspenTech segment, expands the Company's offerings in the power industry to include the digitization and modernization of the electric grid. The Company recognized goodwill of $967 (none of which is expected to be tax deductible), identifiable intangible assets of $783, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of approximately 11 years, and deferred tax liabilities of $193. Results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021 included first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to backlog amortization and deferred revenue of $30 and $14, respectively, and fees of $6.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold cash return on their initial investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nIn 2020, the Company acquired three businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the Climate Technologies segment, for $126, net of cash acquired.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Emerson reported an Adjusted EBITA Margin of 38.0%. While the 2023 10-K does not explicitly state the Adjusted EBITA Margin figure, it expands on the company's use of non-GAAP measures, including detailed explanations of Adjusted EBITA and its components, suggesting continued emphasis on operational performance metrics. The lack of a stated margin in 2023 prevents a direct quantitative comparison, but the increased disclosure depth indicates that Adjusted EBITA and its margin remain key performance indicators. This evolution suggests Emerson is placing greater emphasis on transparency around operational performance, even though we cannot determine if the margin increased, decreased, or remained stable based solely on the provided evidence.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - While the exact margin figure for 2023 cannot be determined, the increased disclosure around Adjusted EBITA indicates a strategic shift toward greater transparency and emphasis on operational performance metrics."

The facility had no financial covenants, was unsecured, and fees to maintain it were described as immaterial. In 2023, the Company entered into a new $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility in February 2023, which replaced the May 2018 facility. The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, unsecured status, and multiple interest rate alternatives. Again, fees to maintain the facility were disclosed as immaterial. While the facility was renewed with the same capacity, the timing of the renewal shifted from May to February, indicating a potential adjustment in the company's financial planning or negotiation cycle.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, the backup credit facility was a $3.5 billion five-year facility entered into in May 2018, with no financial covenants, unsecured, and immaterial fees.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2023, a new $3.5 billion five-year facility was entered into in February 2023, replacing the 2018 facility, with identical structural and covenant terms, and again fees were described as immaterial.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The facility amount and terms remained stable, but the timing of the renewal changed from May to February, suggesting a procedural or strategic shift in facility renewal timing."

In 2023, while the company continued to disclose Adjusted EBITA as a key performance metric, it did not explicitly report the dollar value or margin for that year. However, the continued emphasis on Adjusted EBITA in 2023 as a metric used by management to evaluate operational performance suggests a strategic focus on maintaining or improving this metric. The absence of a specific figure in 2023 makes it challenging to quantify the exact change, but the prior year's growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in operational efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Emerson's Adjusted EBITA was $249 million with a margin of 38.0%, showing a significant increase from the previous year.",

        "Step 3: The evolution shows a prior strong upward trend in Adjusted EBITA and margin, but the lack of 2023 figures prevents quantifying the exact change, though the continued disclosure suggests ongoing strategic importance."

The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065. See Note 19 for additional information about the Company's asbestos liabilities and related insurance receivables.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is held harmless and is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.\n\nAt September 30, 2022, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\n\n## (14) INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings consist of the following:\n\n",

This positioned Emerson as the controlling shareholder in a newly combined entity with $1.1 billion in pro forma fiscal 2022 net sales. By 2023, Emerson's role had evolved, as it received a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv, which was linked to its AspenTech segment. Additionally, in early 2023, Emerson received $15 related to the same interest. These actions indicate a shift from a direct controlling stake to a more financially strategic involvement through distributions, while still maintaining a significant ownership position.",

Our purpose is to drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. Sales by geographic destination in 2022 were: the Americas, 56 percent; Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa, 28 percent (China, 12 percent); and Europe, 16 percent.\n\nPortfolio management is an integral component of Emerson's growth and value creation strategy. Over the past 18 months, Emerson has taken significant actions to accelerate the transformation of its portfolio through the completion of strategic acquisitions and divestitures of non-core businesses. These actions were undertaken to create a higher growth and cohesive industrial technology portfolio as a global automation leader serving a diversified set of end markets with differentiated capabilities in intelligent devices and software. The Company's recent portfolio actions include the following transactions.\n\n- On October 31, 2022, the Company announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Climate Technologies business (which constitutes the Climate Technologies segment, excluding Therm-O-Disc which was divested earlier in fiscal 2022) to private equity funds managed by Blackstone (\"Blackstone\") in a transaction valued at $14.0 billion. Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close, while retaining a 45 percent non-controlling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated October 31, 2022, for additional information.\n- On October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had fiscal 2022 net sales of $630 million and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment.\n- On May 16, 2022, the Company completed the combination of two of its stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software business (collectively, the 'Emerson Industrial Software Business') with Aspen Technology, Inc. ('Heritage AspenTech') to create 'New AspenTech', a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies (hereinafter referred to as \"AspenTech\"). The Company contributed the Emerson Industrial Software Business and $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders and upon closing of the transaction owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). On a pro forma basis, AspenTech had fiscal 2022 net sales of $1.1 billion.\n- On July 27, 2022, AspenTech entered into an agreement to acquire Micromine, a global leader in design and operational solutions for the mining industry, for AU $900 (approximately $623 USD based on exchange rates when the transaction was announced). The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2022, subject to various regulatory approvals.\n- On May 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business, which was reported in the Climate Technologies segment, to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC.\n\nFurther information regarding acquisition and divestiture activity is set forth in Note 4.\n\nFor fiscal year 2022, the Company reported four segments: Automation Solutions ; AspenTech; and Climate Technologies and Tools &amp; Home Products, which together comprise the Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions business. A summary of the Company's businesses is described below.\n\n- Automation Solutions - enables process, hybrid and discrete manufacturers to maximize production, protect personnel and the environment, and optimize their energy efficiency and operating costs through a broad",

By 2023, aircraft manufacturing contributed only $7 billion to the total increase of $52 billion, indicating a significantly reduced role compared to other revenue drivers like aircraft services.

      "answer": "C5ISR solutions revenue decreased from $4,388 million in 2021 to $4,297 million in 2022, primarily due to timing on international programs, supply chain shortages, and lingering impacts of the pandemic, including the absence of approximately $115 million in revenue from a satellite communications business sold in 2020. However, by 2023, C5ISR solutions revenue increased to $4,463 million, reflecting a recovery and reversal of the earlier decline. This turnaround indicates that the business began to stabilize and grow again after facing headwinds in 2022.",

The decrease in C5ISR solutions revenue was also due to approximately $115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year. These decreases were offset partially by increased IT services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of, and increased access to, customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic.\n\nThe  Technologies  segment's  operating  margin  increased  60  basis  points  compared  with  2020  due  to favorable contract mix and reduced COVID-related impacts in our IT services business, particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, operating results in 2020 included  an  approximate  $40  loss  on  a  contract  with  a  non-U.S.  customer  from  schedule  delays  caused  by COVID-related travel restrictions, offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Technologies segment's 2022 revenue to be between $12.8 and $13 billion with operating margin of around 10%.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nCorporate  operating  results  totaled  $84  in  2021  and  $56  in  2020  and  consisted  primarily  of  equity-based compensation expense.

However, in 2023, the reported Aerospace revenue was $8.621 billion, reflecting only a $0.054 billion increase over the projected $8.4 billion, which indicates a much smaller growth than the anticipated $2 billion.

In 2021, aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were also impacted negatively by the settlement of claims with a supplier related to the assignment of warranties following the end of G550 production.\n\nThese decreases were offset partially by increased aircraft services operating earnings due to higher volume and a favorable mix of aircraft services. The operating earnings variance also reflects restructuring actions taken in 2020 to adjust the workforce size to the revised production levels.\n\nOperating earnings in 2021 reflected higher G&amp;A/other expenses due primarily to increased R&amp;D expenses associated  with  ongoing  product  development  efforts,  including  flight  test  activities  for  the  G700,  which  is scheduled to enter  service  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  In  total,  the Aerospace  segment's  operating  margin decreased 70 basis points in 2021 to 12.7%.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Aerospace segment's 2022 revenue to increase to approximately $8.4 billion due to increased new aircraft deliveries with operating margin of approximately 12.8%.

By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)\n\nFor an overview of our operating segments, including a discussion of our major products and services, see the Business  discussion  contained  in  Item  1.  The  following  discussion  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations  for  2021  compared  with  2020  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 8, while a discussion of 2020 compared with 2019 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC UPDATE\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities since March 2020. During this time, we have continued to conduct our operations while responding to the pandemic with actions to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees, business, supply chain and customers. Consistent with our prioritization of the health and safety of our employees, we continue to encourage and promote vaccination across the company. Any long-term impact to our business is currently unknown  due  to  the  uncertainty  around  the  pandemic's  duration  and  its  broader  impact.  For  additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\n\nThe  United  States  and  other  governments  have  taken  several  steps  to  respond  to  the  pandemic.  On September 9, 2021, the president signed Executive Order 14042, initiating a process whereby covered federal contractors and subcontractors must implement federally required vaccine mandates. A clause implementing the federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  has  been  incorporated  into  a  number  of  our  federal  contracts.  In  light  of certain court orders, however, the Office of Management and Budget has stated that the U.S. government will not take action to enforce this clause until further notice. If ultimately upheld, this federal contract requirement may  affect  various  business  units  differently.  We  are  working  closely  with  our  customer  to  ensure  that  we minimize disruptions  and  potential  employee  attrition  in  the  event  that  applicable  contract  modifications  are enforceable and as additional modifications are received that could trigger implementation. To the extent that we  or  our  subcontractors  experience  employee  attrition  and/or  work  stoppages,  our  costs  could  increase, schedules could slip on affected programs and our ability to perform under some contracts could be negatively affected, particularly in those instances where we cannot receive cost reimbursement.\n\nOur Aerospace segment's operating results have experienced the most significant impact from the pandemic. New  aircraft  deliveries  in  2021  reflected  our  decision  in  2020  to  reduce  production  rates  to  accommodate supply chain challenges and reduced demand due to the pandemic. However, aircraft demand has been strong in 2021,  with  orders  reaching  their  highest  level  in  over  a  decade.  Similarly,  demand  for  aircraft  services  has improved as air travel has increased, but remains below pre-pandemic levels in some regions of the world. Our U.S. government business continues to experience some disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in  our  Technologies  segment.  The  Review  of  Operating  Segments  includes  additional  information  on  the impacts of the pandemic for the affected segments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics expected the Marine Systems segment's revenue to be approximately $10.8 billion with an operating margin of 8.6%. By 2023, the segment's actual revenue increased to $12,461 million, representing a significant growth compared to $11,040 million in 2022. However, the operating margin declined from 8.6% in 2022 to an implied lower value in 2023, as the document notes early work on new submarine programs typically has lower initial profit rates. This indicates a trajectory of revenue growth but margin pressure due to the nature of new program execution.",

These increases were offset partially by delivery of our last  commercial  containership  in  backlog  in  2020  and  lower  volume  on  the  Columbia-class  design  contract. Overall, the Marine Systems segment's operating margin decreased 30 basis points in 2021, reflecting the shift in mix to early work on new submarine programs with typical lower initial profit rates.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Marine Systems segment's 2022 revenue to be approximately $10.8 billion. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 8.6% as each shipyard continues to come down the learning curve on their major construction programs.\n\n## COMBAT SYSTEMS\n\n",

The decrease in C5ISR solutions revenue was also due to approximately $115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year. These decreases were offset partially by increased IT services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of, and increased access to, customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic.\n\nThe  Technologies  segment's  operating  margin  increased  60  basis  points  compared  with  2020  due  to favorable contract mix and reduced COVID-related impacts in our IT services business, particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, operating results in 2020 included  an  approximate  $40  loss  on  a  contract  with  a  non-U.S.  customer  from  schedule  delays  caused  by COVID-related travel restrictions, offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Technologies segment's 2022 revenue to be between $12.8 and $13 billion with operating margin of around 10%.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nCorporate  operating  results  totaled  $84  in  2021  and  $56  in  2020  and  consisted  primarily  of  equity-based compensation expense.

Both years indicate that the effective tax rate benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, among other factors like research and development tax credits and employee equity awards.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of strategic investments in early stage companies made by our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other non-operating income, net in 2021 was $288 million, compared to other non-operating expense, net of $37 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in the fair value of investments held in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nOur effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 16.4% for both 2021 and 2020. The rates for both 2021 and 2020 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, the research and development tax credit, dividends paid to the company's  defined  contribution  plans  with  an  employee  stock  ownership  plan  feature  and  tax  deductions  for  employee  equity awards.\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with  retroactive  effect,  including  the  amortization  for  research  or  experimental  expenditures,  could  significantly  impact  our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. Recent  proposals  to  increase  the  U.S.  corporate  income  tax  rate  would  require  us  to  increase  our  net  deferred  tax  assets  upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on a 21% federal statutory income tax rate, and primarily relate  to  our  postretirement  benefit  plans.  In  addition  to  future  changes  in  tax  laws,  the  amount  of  net  deferred  tax  assets  will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. While it is possible that Congress  may  defer,  modify,  or  repeal  this  provision,  potentially  with  retroactive  effect,  and  we  continue  to  have  ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that this  provision  will  be  deferred,  modified,  or  repealed.  Furthermore,  in  anticipation  of  the  new  provision  taking  effect,  we  have analyzed the provision and worked with our advisors to evaluate its application to our business. If this provision is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, we estimate it will decrease our expected cash from operations in 2022 by approximately $500 million and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when this provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. While the largest impact will be to 2022 cash from operations, the impact would continue over the five year amortization period, but would decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six.\n\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  and  the  United  Kingdom).  The  final  determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\n\n## Net Earnings from Continuing Operations\n\nWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share)  in  2020.  Both  net  earnings  and  earnings  per  share  in  2021  were  affected  by  the  factors  mentioned  above,  including  the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company. Additionally,  both  net  earnings  and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues  experienced  on  a  classified  program  at  our Aeronautics  business  segment.  Earnings  per  share  also  benefited  from  a  net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  share  issuance  under  our  stock-based  awards  and  certain  defined contribution plans.\n\n## Net Loss from Discontinued Operations\n\nIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business divested in 2016.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased slightly to $1.6 billion. This indicates that while the company continued to experience favorable profit adjustments from its long-term contracts in 2023, the magnitude of these adjustments was lower compared to the previous year, suggesting a moderate decline in the rate of improvement or risk retirement on those contracts.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to lower pension contributions, as we made no contributions in 2021 compared to a pension contribution  of  $1.0  billion  in  2020,  and  an  increase  of  approximately  $865  million  in  cash  from  our  net  earnings  adjusted  for noncash  items.  These  increases  in  cash  from  operations  were  partially  offset  by  an  increase  of  approximately  $720  million  in payroll taxes and an increase of about $100 million in accelerated payments to our supply chain. During 2021, we paid employer payroll  taxes  of  $942  million,  compared  to  $222  million  during  2020.  The  increase  in  employer  payroll  taxes  was  due  to  the deferral of $460 million of payments in 2020, half of which were paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and half of which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022, pursuant to the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2021, we accelerated $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers that were due in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2.1 billion of payments to suppliers as of December 31, 2020 that were due in the first quarter of 2021. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments.

By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, LMT capitalized pre-contract costs under conditions of direct relation to a contract, probability of award, enhancement of resources, and recoverability, with recognition as cost of sales upon contract receipt.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, LMT maintained the same capitalization criteria but added context that these costs are incurred to enhance schedule and milestone achievement, indicating a shift in emphasis toward strategic planning and customer alignment.",
        "Step 3: The treatment of pre-contract costs remained financially consistent, but the 2023 disclosure evolved in framing, suggesting a more proactive and strategic rationale for these expenditures."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInventories -  We  record  inventories  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  value.  The  majority  of  our  inventory represents work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. In addition, costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded  are  recorded  in  inventories  as  work-in-process  if  we  determine  that  those  costs  relate  directly  to  a  contract  or  to  an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services  to  the  customer  upon  the  receipt  of  the  anticipated  contract. All  other  pre-contract  costs,  including  start-up  costs,  are expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in firstout or average cost methods. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that precontract costs are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.\n\nContract liabilities -  Contract  liabilities  include  advance  payments  and  billings  in  excess  of  revenue  recognized.  Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straightline method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment was $904 million in 2021, $853 million in 2020 and $794 million in 2019.\n\nWe  review  the  carrying  amounts  of  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  if  events  or  changes  in  the  facts  and  circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash  flows  of  the  related  asset  grouping  to  its  carrying  amount.  If  an  asset  is  determined  to  be  impaired,  we  recognize  an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.\n\nCapitalized software - We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, capitalized software totaled $777 million and $686 million, net of accumulated amortization of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $175 million in 2021, $166 million in 2020 and $111 million in 2019.\n\nFair  value  of  financial  instruments -  We  measure  the  fair  value  of  our  financial  instruments  using  observable  and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.\n\n- Level 3 - unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nInvestments - Substantially all assets measured at fair value represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our investments held in trust totaled $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nNet gains on these securities were $205 million, $231 million and $233 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align  the  classification  of  changes  in  the  market  value  of  investments  held  for  the  plan  with  changes  in  the  value  of  the corresponding plan liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, through our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make strategic investments in certain early stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments may be in the form of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds. Most of the investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there  is  an  observable  price  change  or  reduced  for  impairment,  if  applicable.  Investments  with  quoted  market  prices  in  active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The carrying amounts of investments",

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of advanced procurement costs related to the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract evolve between 2022 and 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that it would incur advanced procurement costs (precontract costs) to enhance its ability to meet the revised schedule and certain milestones on the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at the Aeronautics business segment. These costs were tied to the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program. By 2023, the company continued to incur these costs but shifted the terminology to 'pre-contract costs' and expanded the context to include ongoing monitoring of recoverability based on the customer's decisions about future phases. Additionally, while cumulative losses on the program increased from $225 million in 2022 to $270 million in 2023, the company maintained its focus on managing these advanced procurement costs in relation to program performance and future scope decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company specifically mentioned 'advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs)' in relation to the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract and noted that these were incurred to meet revised schedule and milestones.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the terminology shifted to 'pre-contract costs' and the disclosure included continued monitoring of recoverability, while also noting that cumulative losses on the program had increased to $270 million.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a continued emphasis on managing these costs, with a more mature context around program losses and future phase decisions, indicating a deepened strategic and financial focus on procurement risk management."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.6 billion ($5.81 per share) in 2021 and $1.5 billion ($5.33 and $5.29 per share)  in  2020  and  2019.  We  recognized  net  sales  from  performance  obligations  satisfied  in  prior  periods  of  approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\n\nWe have  experienced  performance  issues  on  a  classified  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  that  involves  highly  complex design  and  systems  integration  at  our  Aeronautics  business  segment.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  completed  a comprehensive  review  and  negotiation  of  scope  of  the  program  with  our  customer,  including  the  technical  requirements, performance to date, remaining work, schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program. At the conclusion of the review, we determined that the total costs to complete the current phase of the program would exceed the contract price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a loss of $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after tax) on the program at our Aeronautics business segment, which represented our estimated total losses on the current phase of the program. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the contract with our customer to modify the contract scope and price. The terms of the amendment are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  loss  recognized  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021.  Therefore,  our  current estimated loss remains at $225 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule  and  certain  milestones.  We  will  monitor  the  recoverability  of  precontract  costs,  which  could  be  impacted  by  the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nWe are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. Cumulative losses on this program were approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. As  of  December  31,  2021,  cumulative  losses  remained  at  approximately  $260  million.  We  continue  to  monitor  program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed actions taken to reduce pension obligation volatility, including pension risk transfer transactions such as the August 2021 purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for $4.9 billion in pension obligations, and noted a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.875% for its defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, LMT focused on pension risk transfer transactions, including a $4.9 billion GAC purchase and a $1.7 billion noncash settlement charge, with actuarial assumptions like a 2.875% discount rate.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, LMT emphasized the classification of FAS pension costs in financial statements and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of qualified pension plans.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The focus shifted from pension liability reduction and risk mitigation in 2022 to structured financial reporting and disclosure of pension plan funded status in 2023, indicating an evolution in how the company communicates pension-related financial information."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Overview\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life  insurance  plans  and  other  postemployment  plans  (collectively,  postretirement  benefit  plans  -  see  'Note  12  -  Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

We  recognized  net  sales  from  performance  obligations  satisfied  in  prior  periods  of  approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\n\nWe have  experienced  performance  issues  on  a  classified  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  that  involves  highly  complex design  and  systems  integration  at  our  Aeronautics  business  segment.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  completed  a comprehensive  review  and  negotiation  of  scope  of  the  program  with  our  customer,  including  the  technical  requirements, performance to date, remaining work, schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program. At the conclusion of the review, we determined that the total costs to complete the current phase of the program would exceed the contract price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a loss of $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after tax) on the program at our Aeronautics business segment, which represented our estimated total losses on the current phase of the program. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the contract with our customer to modify the contract scope and price. The terms of the amendment are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  loss  recognized  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021.  Therefore,  our  current estimated loss remains at $225 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule  and  certain  milestones.  We  will  monitor  the  recoverability  of  precontract  costs,  which  could  be  impacted  by  the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nWe are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. Cumulative losses on this program were approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. As  of  December  31,  2021,  cumulative  losses  remained  at  approximately  $260  million.  We  continue  to  monitor  program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## Revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded net sales of $67.0 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion, while in 2023, the increase was $1.6 billion. This indicates a slight decrease in the positive impact of these adjustments, suggesting that the company experienced fewer favorable revisions in estimated total costs to fulfill performance obligations in 2023 compared to 2022.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin recognized CAS pension cost in each business segment's net sales and cost of sales, with the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment representing the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",

        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift in the nature of the service cost component from a net expense in 2022 to a net income position in 2023, suggesting a favorable evolution in the pension cost adjustment."

For  additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit  Plans'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Amounts  related  to  other  liabilities  represent  the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2021. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.\n\nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase  obligations  for  operating  activities  in  the  preceding  table  include  approximately  $52.8  billion  related  to  contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts 'for convenience' under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.\n\nThe majority of our capital expenditures for 2021 and those planned for 2022 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2022 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2021 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for  future  periods.  Expenditures  for  equipment  and  facilities  infrastructure  are  generally  incurred  to  support  new  and  existing programs  across  all  of  our  business  segments.  For  example,  we  have  projects  underway  at  Aeronautics  to  support  classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\n\nWe  also  may  enter  into  industrial  cooperation  agreements,  sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  as  a  condition  to obtaining  orders  for  our  products  and  services  from  certain  customers  in  foreign  countries.  These  agreements  are  designed  to enhance  the  social  and  economic  environment  of  the  foreign  country  by  requiring  the  contractor  to  promote  investment  in  the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g. , our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin's profit booking rates were positively influenced by the company's ability to reduce risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts, which led to lower estimated total costs and higher profitability. By 2023, the impact of profit booking rates had shifted to a negative influence, as changes in estimates and assumptions during contract execution began to unfavorably affect segment operating profit and margin. This evolution highlights a growing sensitivity in financial outcomes due to increased uncertainty and risk exposure in contract performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, profit booking rates were positively impacted by risk retirement, leading to lower estimated total costs and higher profitability.",
        "Step 2: By 2023, the company noted that changes in estimates and assumptions during contract performance could unfavorably impact operating profit and margin, indicating a negative shift in the influence of profit booking rates.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a controlled, risk-mitigated profit trajectory in 2022 to a more volatile and risk-exposed scenario in 2023."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\n## Revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion method\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded net sales of $67.0 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInventories -  We  record  inventories  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  value.  The  majority  of  our  inventory represents work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. In addition, costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded  are  recorded  in  inventories  as  work-in-process  if  we  determine  that  those  costs  relate  directly  to  a  contract  or  to  an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services  to  the  customer  upon  the  receipt  of  the  anticipated  contract. All  other  pre-contract  costs,  including  start-up  costs,  are expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in firstout or average cost methods. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that precontract costs are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.\n\nContract liabilities -  Contract  liabilities  include  advance  payments  and  billings  in  excess  of  revenue  recognized.  Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straightline method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment was $904 million in 2021, $853 million in 2020 and $794 million in 2019.\n\nWe  review  the  carrying  amounts  of  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  if  events  or  changes  in  the  facts  and  circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash  flows  of  the  related  asset  grouping  to  its  carrying  amount.  If  an  asset  is  determined  to  be  impaired,  we  recognize  an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.\n\nCapitalized software - We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, capitalized software totaled $777 million and $686 million, net of accumulated amortization of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $175 million in 2021, $166 million in 2020 and $111 million in 2019.\n\nFair  value  of  financial  instruments -  We  measure  the  fair  value  of  our  financial  instruments  using  observable  and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.\n\n- Level 3 - unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nInvestments - Substantially all assets measured at fair value represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our investments held in trust totaled $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nNet gains on these securities were $205 million, $231 million and $233 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align  the  classification  of  changes  in  the  market  value  of  investments  held  for  the  plan  with  changes  in  the  value  of  the corresponding plan liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, through our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make strategic investments in certain early stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments may be in the form of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds. Most of the investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there  is  an  observable  price  change  or  reduced  for  impairment,  if  applicable.  Investments  with  quoted  market  prices  in  active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The carrying amounts of investments",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe decrease in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021 was principally driven by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) in connection with the transfer of $4.9 billion of our gross  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company  on August  3,  2021.  See  'Note  12  Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  following segment  discussions also include information relating to  backlog  for  each  segment.  Backlog  was approximately $135.4 billion and $147.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity  contracts.  Funded  backlog  was  approximately  $88.5  billion  at  December  31,  2021,  as compared to $102.3 billion at December 31, 2020. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts.\n\nManagement evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of  operating  expense.  Consequently,  our  discussion  of  business  segment  performance  focuses  on  net  sales  and  operating  profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\n\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated  in  a  manner  specified  by  the  requirements  of  each  contract.  For  example,  cost  data  provided  to  a  customer  for  a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter  into  long-term  supply  contracts  for  certain  materials  or  components  to  coincide  with  the  production  schedule  of  certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.\n\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newlydeveloped product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor,  subcontractor,  overhead  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The  initial  profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that future pension risk transfer transactions could result in noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period, but did not specify the magnitude or likelihood of such charges. In 2023, the company maintained the same general disclosure but added that these transactions could also result in the company making additional contributions to the pension trust, indicating a more detailed articulation of the financial risks involved. While the core risk remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure expanded on the potential dual impact of additional contributions and noncash charges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company stated that pension risk transfer transactions could result in 'noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.'",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company reiterated the risk of 'noncash settlement charges' but added that such transactions could also result in 'making additional contributions to the pension trust.'",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in the framing of the risk, with 2023 providing a more comprehensive view of potential financial consequences, though the core risk of noncash settlement charges remained."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\noperations.  We  also  could  be  adversely  affected  by,  or  liable  for,  actions  taken  by  these  joint  ventures  that  we  do  not  control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation and anti-boycott laws.\n\nDepending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results are affected  by  the  conduct  and  performance  of  businesses  over  which  we  do  not  exercise  control  and,  as  a  result,  we  may  not  be successful  in  achieving  the  growth  or  other  intended  benefits  of  strategic  investments.  Our  equity  investments  had  the  greatest impact on our Space business segment where approximately 6% of its 2021 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity method investees, primarily that in United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThrough our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing  new  technologies  applicable  to  our  core  businesses  and  new  initiatives  important  to  Lockheed  Martin.  These investments may be in the forms of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds and are generally illiquid at the time of investment, which limits our ability to exit an investment or realize an investment absent a liquidity  event. Typically,  we  hold  a  non-controlling  interest  and,  therefore,  are  unable  to  influence  strategic  decisions  by  these companies and may have limited visibility into their activities, which may result in our not realizing the intended benefits of the investments. For fund investments, we have even less influence and visibility as a non-controlling investor in a fund that invests in other companies. We may recognize significant gains or losses attributable to adjustments of the investments' fair value, including impairments up to and including the full value of the investment, which can be affected by the success of the companies, market volatility and changes in valuations of our investment holdings.\n\n## Risks  Related  to  Significant  Contingencies,  Uncertainties  and  Estimates,  including  Pension,  Taxes,  Environmental  and Litigation Costs\n\nPension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.\n\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders' equity.\n\nWith regard to cash flow, we have made substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and expect to make future contributions as required or when deemed prudent. We  generally  can  recover  a  significant  portion  of  these  contributions  related  to  our  plans  as  allowable  costs  on  our  U.S. Government contracts,  including  FMS.  However,  there  is  a  lag  between  the  time  when  we  contribute  cash  to  our  plans  under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can affect the timing of our cash flows.\n\nIn recent years, we have taken actions to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plans through pension risk transfer  transactions  whereby  we  purchase  group  annuity  contracts  (GACs)  from  insurance  companies  using  assets  from  the pension trust and expect to continue to evaluate such transactions in the future. Although under the majority of the GACs we have purchased we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligations, we have purchased and may in the future purchase GACs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plans but we remain responsible for paying benefits under the plans to covered retirees and beneficiaries and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on its obligations to reimburse the pension trusts. While we believe pension risk transfer transactions are beneficial, future transactions, depending on their size, could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.\n\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders' equity, see 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in the MD&amp;A and 'Note 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",
