      "question": "How has the gross margin contribution from the Data Centers segment evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its financial performance over time?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Data Centers segment was newly established as a reportable segment following the CoreSite Acquisition in December 2021, indicating its strategic importance as a new business line. By 2024, the Data Centers segment reported a gross margin of $444.6 million, contributing positively to the overall segment gross margin. This reflects a significant turnaround from its initial reporting in 2023, where the segment had reported a negative gross margin of $427.0 million in 2022, suggesting early operational losses. The improvement indicates strong performance and integration success post-acquisition.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a transformation from a loss-making segment to a profitable contributor, indicating successful integration and operational improvements post-acquisition."

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as 'anticipates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects' or similar ex pressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future prospects of growth in the communications infrastructure leasing industry, the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our customers and other competitive and financial pressures, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, the ex pected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business, our expectations for the closing of signed agreements and the expected impacts of such agreements on our business, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future ex penditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, changes in zoning, tax  and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital ex penditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for tax ation as a real estate investment trust ('REIT'), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and technology failures, including cybersecurity and data privacy incidents. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions 'Business' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' as well as in this Annual Report generally.\n\nYou should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur. References in this Annual Report to 'we,' 'our' and the 'Company' refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the contex t requires.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its components and adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining it as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, less dividends to noncontrolling interests, and including adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward more quantitative disclosure, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 disclosure included detailed line items such as losses from the sale or disposal of real estate and real estate-related impairment charges, which dropped significantly from $414.6 million in 2023 to $91.6 million in 2024, a 78% decrease. This evolution reflects a shift from primarily qualitative disclosure in 2023 to a more structured, quantitative presentation in 2024, with emphasis on performance metrics and adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company defined Nareit FFO in qualitative terms, focusing on its composition and relevance as a performance metric without providing comparative numerical data.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company disclosed specific dollar figures for Nareit FFO, showing an increase from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, and also detailed the components such as losses from sale or disposal of real estate, which decreased from $414.6 million to $91.6 million.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from descriptive guidance in 2023 to a more detailed, quantitative disclosure in 2024, with a focus on performance trends and adjustments."

      "answer": "In 2022, American Tower Corporation reported a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $0.4 million, which decreased to $0.3 million in 2023, reflecting a 25% decline. By 2024, the company no longer disclosed any loss on retirement of long-term obligations, indicating a potential shift in its debt management strategy. This evolution suggests that the company may have reduced or ceased early debt retirement activities during the reporting period, which contributed to the elimination of such losses.",

        "Step 1: Identify the loss on retirement of long-term obligations in 2022 and 2023, noting the decrease from $0.4 million to $0.3 million.",
        "Step 2: Observe that in 2024, the loss on retirement of long-term obligations is no longer reported, indicating the absence of such losses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company mentioned 'the expected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business' and 'the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry' as part of its forward-looking statements. By 2024, while the reference to strategic partnerships remained, the phrasing evolved to 'the expected impacts of such agreements on our business,' indicating a shift from general partnerships to more specific signed agreements. Additionally, in 2023, the company referenced 'future capital expenditure levels,' which in 2024 was more specifically tied to 'our future capital expenditure levels' in the context of industry trends and competitive pressures. These changes suggest a more concrete framing of industry expenditure expectations in 2024, focusing on tangible agreements rather than general strategic partnerships.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company referenced 'the expected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business' and 'the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry.'",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the language shifted to 'the expected impacts of such agreements on our business' and 'our future capital expenditure levels' were explicitly mentioned in the context of industry trends.",
        "Step 3: The change from 'strategic partnerships' to 'such agreements' indicates a shift toward more concrete, signed commitments, while the sharper focus on capital expenditures reflects a more defined outlook on industry spending."

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as 'anticipates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects' or similar ex pressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future prospects of growth in the communications infrastructure leasing industry, the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our customers and other competitive and financial pressures, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, the ex pected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business, our expectations for the closing of signed agreements and the expected impacts of such agreements on our business, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future ex penditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, changes in zoning, tax  and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital ex penditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for tax ation as a real estate investment trust ('REIT'), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and technology failures, including cybersecurity and data privacy incidents. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions 'Business' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' as well as in this Annual Report generally.\n\nYou should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur. References in this Annual Report to 'we,' 'our' and the 'Company' refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the contex t requires.",

However, in 2024, the company actually spent $79.6 million on Start-up capital expenditures, which was lower than the upper bound of its earlier forecast.

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) by American Tower Corporation evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of its definition and the components used in its calculation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, American Tower Corporation provided a detailed definition of AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), explaining that it is derived from Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and adjusted for various items including straight-line revenue and expense, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, non-real estate depreciation, amortization, and other adjustments. The company emphasized that AFFO is used internally and by investors to evaluate operating performance by removing non-operational items. In 2024, the company continued to disclose AFFO but placed more emphasis on the actual dollar figures and percentage changes year-over-year. For example, AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased from $4,611.5 million in 2023 to $4,934.1 million in 2024, a 7% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included a more structured presentation of AFFO components, such as capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates, with explicit year-over-year comparisons. This evolution indicates a shift from primarily definitional transparency in 2023 to a more performance-focused disclosure in 2024, emphasizing quantitative trends.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the state/situation in 2023 - The 2023 filing focused on defining AFFO in detail, including its components and rationale for its use as a performance metric.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from definitional focus in 2023 to performance-based disclosure with comparative metrics in 2024 represents a transformation in how AFFO is presented to stakeholders."

      "answer": "In 2023, the company explicitly stated that many international leasing arrangements required the communications site to have power for a specified percentage of time, and if delivery fell below that level, a corresponding reduction in revenue was recorded. This contractual service level requirement was clearly tied to revenue recognition for Fixed Power Revenue. In 2024, while the company continued to recognize Fixed Power Revenue monthly over the lease term and acknowledged the same service-level-to-revenue linkage for international arrangements, it omitted specific mention of the percentage-based service requirement and corresponding revenue reduction mechanism. This suggests a potential shift in emphasis or detail in how service levels impact revenue, though the core recognition principle for Fixed Power Revenue remained consistent across both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company disclosed that international leasing arrangements often required a specified percentage of uptime for power delivery, with revenue reductions if service levels were not met.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company still recognized Fixed Power Revenue monthly and acknowledged service-level impacts, but no longer specified the percentage-based requirement or revenue reduction mechanism.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a subtle evolution in the disclosure around service level enforcement and its financial impact, indicating a less explicit focus on quantifiable service thresholds in 2024."

The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee.\n\nLessor -The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company's communications real estate assets. The Company's lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fix ed escalation percentage or an inflationary index , or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the ex piration of the lease term.\n\nThe Company's leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer's underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fix ed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\n\nThe Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets.",

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

This followed earlier impairments in 2022, including $411.6 million related to tenant-related intangible assets. In 2024, however, no goodwill impairment was identified for the India reporting unit, as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.

This impairment was included in 'Loss from discontinued operations.' In 2024, the India reporting unit was no longer subject to impairment concerns as the strategic transaction was finalized, and the unit was effectively exited.

Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives.\n\nAdditionally, certain of our intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is ex pected to benefit us.\n\nWe accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024.

Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\n- If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n- Impairment of Assets-Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the results of our annual goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of our Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.

Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset's fair value, as compared to the asset's carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nFair Value Measurements -The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations -When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. G enerally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of ex pected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company's aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approx imate the Company's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe Company finalized its review of the estimated settlement dates for its asset retirement obligations during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimated settlement dates based on its historical operating experience, management's intent with respect to the assets, and the assets' estimated useful lives. Based on its review and analysis, the Company concluded that a revision in the estimated settlement dates for its asset retirement obligations was appropriate. The Company accounted for the change in estimated settlement dates as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which was recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. The extension in the estimated settlement dates (i) resulted in a $470 million increase in the asset retirement obligation liability, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset and an $875 million increase in the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations, and (ii) resulted in an estimated $75 million decrease in accretion ex pense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nIncome Taxes -As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income tax es. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax  consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  basis, as well as operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax  rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax  assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future tax able income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax  assets. V aluation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income tax es if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets' recoverability.",

In contrast, by 2024, the company reported a decrease of $36.4 million in pass-through revenue in the Europe segment, mainly due to lower energy costs. This reflects a significant shift in the direction and drivers of pass-through revenue between the two years.",

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value.

      "answer": "In 2023, increases in segment gross margin were cited as the primary driver of higher operating profit for Europe, Latin America, and Data Centers, while the Services segment experienced a decrease in operating profit due to a drop in segment gross margin. By 2024, the gross margin for Europe had decreased from prior year levels to $525.3 million, Latin America increased to $1,187.7 million, and Data Centers grew to $534.0 million. Correspondingly, operating profit for Europe decreased to $460.5 million, Latin America increased to $1,076.7 million, and Data Centers rose to $455.2 million. This shows a continued alignment between gross margin and operating profit trends, though the magnitude of change varied by region.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, segment gross margin increases were directly linked to operating profit growth in Europe, Latin America, and Data Centers, while the Services segment saw a decline in both gross margin and operating profit.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, specific segment gross margin figures were $525.3M (Europe), $1,187.7M (Latin America), and $534.0M (Data Centers), with corresponding operating profits of $460.5M, $1,076.7M, and $455.2M respectively.",
        "Step 3: The relationship evolved with continued alignment between gross margin and operating profit trends, but with differing magnitudes\u2014Europe saw a drop in both metrics, Latin America a strong increase, and Data Centers a moderate increase."

The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis included current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company indicated that it may incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as it increases its presence in existing markets or expands into new markets. In 2024, while the core statement about expenses remained similar, the document included a footnote indicating that in 2024, approximately 90 new sites were added in India, compared to 865 in 2023 and 4,035 in 2022. This shows a significant reduction in the number of new sites added in India in 2024, suggesting a slowdown in expansion activities, which would likely result in lower associated administrative and development expenses compared to previous years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, AMT disclosed that expansion into new markets could lead to additional segment-level Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expenses.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same disclosure was repeated, but with a new footnote showing a dramatic decline in new site additions in India (from 4,035 in 2022 to 90 in 2024).",
        "Step 3: The change in the number of new sites indicates a reduced pace of market expansion, which implies a corresponding moderation in the growth of related expenses, even though the qualitative risk language remained unchanged."

Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level ex penses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit due to a strategic review that indicated the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Spain reporting unit experienced a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital, which reduced its estimated fair value below carrying value. This impairment was recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2024, the company finalized a review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years. This change in accounting estimate, applied prospectively from January 1, 2024, also affected the amortization of related intangible assets, resulting in a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. While no new goodwill impairment was recorded for Spain in 2024, the updated depreciation policy reflects a strategic and financial recalibration that could influence the long-term valuation and performance metrics of the Spain reporting unit.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the Spain reporting unit had a goodwill impairment of $80.0 million due to a higher weighted average cost of capital, indicating a decline in fair value.",

Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company finalized its review of the estimated useful lives of its tower assets during the first quarter of 2024. The Company now has over 20 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating ex perience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 20 years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is 30 years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company's intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the ex tended useful life and residual value. The ex tension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approx imately $515 million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) resulted in an estimated $730 million ($649 million after tax , or an increase of $1.39 per diluted share) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not ex ceeding thirty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets -The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount ex ceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred with respect to its India reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test based on information observed during its review of strategic alternatives for this reporting unit. The result of the Company's goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The goodwill impairment charge for the Spain reporting unit is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no other goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.",

As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis included current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The reduction in the fair value of the Spain reporting unit was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. The goodwill impairment charge is recorded in Goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following:\n\n",

In 2023, ATC TIPL represented 10% of the company's total property revenue, which was $7,800.7 million. Following the sale and its classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL's contribution was removed from ongoing operations, indicating a structural and financial shift in the company's revenue composition.

      "answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $402.0 million related to the India and Spain reporting units, with a significant portion attributed to the India reporting unit. In 2024, the company recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million specifically for the India reporting unit as of September 30, 2023. This indicates a continued deterioration in the financial health of the India reporting unit, as its carrying amount still exceeded its estimated fair value even after the prior year's impairment, signaling ongoing challenges in this segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, the India reporting unit was associated with a $402.0 million goodwill impairment charge.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, the India reporting unit again triggered a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million, indicating continued financial distress.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The recurrence of a significant impairment charge in 2024 following a major write-down in 2023 shows that the financial health of the India reporting unit did not improve and may have further deteriorated."

      "question": "How did the financial impact of the India reporting unit on AMT evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of fair value assessment and goodwill impairment charges?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations and received third-party indications of value lower than the carrying value, which was used in the goodwill impairment test but did not result in an impairment charge.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, AMT recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit, indicating that its carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The India reporting unit transitioned from a potential impairment risk in 2023 to a confirmed impairment in 2024, representing a significant negative financial impact."

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $0.4 million, while in 2023, the loss decreased slightly to $0.3 million. This indicates a minor reduction in the costs associated with early debt repayments or modifications in 2023 compared to 2022. The losses in both years were relatively small, suggesting that AMT's debt retirement activities had minimal financial impact during this period, especially when compared to the significant loss of $38.2 million recorded in 2021 related to the repayment of the InSite Debt.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's property revenue from Africa was $1,192.5 million, reflecting a 13% increase from the prior year. In 2023, the company reported $1,225.6 million in property revenue from Africa, representing a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022. This indicates a slowdown in the growth rate of property revenue from Africa, suggesting a potential stabilization or maturation of the company's operations in the region after a period of rapid expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Tower evaluated tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, impairment indicators for tenant-related intangible assets included turnover, non-renewal, and cancellation, with recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in the methodology, with increased specificity and formalization of impairment measurement techniques."

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\n\nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset's fair value, as compared to the asset's carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments -Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.\n\nThe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company's exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nFair Value Measurements -The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations -When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

The acquired other intangible assets will amortize over periods ranging from approximately two years to 10 years.\n\nThe acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenantrelated intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Other intangibles represent the value of acquired licenses, trade name and in place leases. In place lease value represents the fair value of costs avoided in securing data center customers, including vacancy periods, legal costs and commissions. In addition, this value also includes assumptions on similar costs avoided upon the renewal or extension of existing leases on a basis consistent with occupancy assumptions used in the fair value of other assets.\n\nThe Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company's intangible assets was 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1.2 billion, $867.2 million and $791.3 million, respectively.\n\nBased on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years:\n\n",

The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company's aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nIncome Taxes -As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets' recoverability.\n\nThe Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) -Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company's other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $4.7 billion, $3.8 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nDistributions -As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses ('NOLs').\n\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company's control, including the Company's financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company's existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company's ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company's distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\nAcquisitions -For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted.\n\nThe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the",

By 2023, the Gain (Loss) on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations was no longer just a reconciliation item but was also explicitly listed among other financial line items such as Interest income, Interest expense, and Other income (expense), which were collectively excluded from segment operating performance.

In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as 'AFFO (common stockholders).'\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments' performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.\n\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT disclosed that power and fuel costs were often reimbursed or shared by the tenant base in many international markets, highlighting a cost-mitigation mechanism for the company. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to clarify that power and fuel costs are part of direct site-level operating expenses, some or all of which may be passed through to customers, but also emphasized that these costs are now explicitly categorized as part of segment-level operational expenses. This indicates a more detailed and structured disclosure in 2023 compared to the more general reimbursement statement in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AMT noted that in many international markets, power and fuel costs were reimbursed or shared by tenants, reducing the company's direct burden of these costs.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from a general reimbursement statement in 2022 to a more detailed operational expense and pass-through disclosure in 2023 represents a transformation in how AMT communicates its treatment of power and fuel costs."

Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base.\n- Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites.\n\nOur property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests and, in select markets, the operation of fiber, the operation of data centers and the provision of backup power through shared generators.

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of lease incentives impact the calculation of future minimum rental receipts between 2022 and 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the company did not disclose any specific amounts related to lease incentives, but indicated that if incentives were present, they were recorded in Other current and noncurrent assets and amortized as a non-cash reduction to revenue. By 2023, the company provided specific figures, showing $31.8 million in Other current assets and $345.7 million in Other non-current assets related to lease incentives. Additionally, the 2023 filing clarified that these incentives were amortized on a straight-line basis over the corresponding lease term as a non-cash reduction to revenue, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of 10 years. This evolution in disclosure indicates a more detailed and quantitative treatment of lease incentives in 2023, which would directly affect the calculation and projection of future minimum rental receipts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, the company acknowledged the presence of lease incentives and their general accounting treatment but did not disclose specific amounts.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, the company disclosed specific values of lease incentives ($31.8M current and $345.7M non-current) and clarified the amortization method and remaining average period.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change reflects an evolution in disclosure depth and specificity regarding lease incentives, which directly informs the calculation of future minimum rental receipts."

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT explicitly described its process for evaluating impairment of the right-of-use lease asset, noting that impairments were primarily driven by sites lacking tenant leases or where expenses exceeded revenues. The company recorded these impairments in 'Other operating expenses' and evaluated them at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows as part of its asset portfolio. By 2023, while the recognition of the right-of-use lease asset remained consistent\u2014calculated as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, and other applicable amounts\u2014the specific mention of impairment evaluation and its triggers was omitted. Instead, the 2023 disclosure focused on the assumptions used in calculating the lease liability, such as lease term and discount rate, which indirectly affect the valuation of the right-of-use asset but did not reiterate the impairment review process. This indicates a shift in emphasis from impairment tracking to initial measurement assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AMT disclosed impairment evaluation of the right-of-use lease asset, including triggers like lack of tenant leases or negative cash flow, and impairment charges were recorded in 'Other operating expenses'.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, AMT continued to recognize the right-of-use lease asset using the same formula but omitted specific details about impairment evaluation and instead emphasized assumptions used in lease liability calculations.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in disclosure focus from impairment tracking and asset write-downs in 2022 to the measurement methodology of lease liabilities (and by extension, right-of-use assets) in 2023, indicating a transformation in how the company communicates its management of this financial metric."

The Company reviews its rightof-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues.

      "question": "How did the financial impact of the Supreme Court of India's AGR ruling on AMT's tower portfolio evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in relation to customer payment behaviors and projected cash flows?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Supreme Court of India reaffirmed the definition of AGR fees in July 2021, and one of AMT\u2019s largest customers in India, VIL, communicated partial payments for the remainder of 2022, with intent to resume full payments in 2023. However, by early 2023, VIL indicated it would not resume full payments, prolonging the financial uncertainty. This evolution reflects a continued material financial impact on AMT\u2019s tower portfolio, with ongoing exposure to customer payment risks affecting projected cash flows and tenant-related intangible asset valuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, VIL communicated partial payments for the remainder of the year but intended to resume full payments in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2023, VIL indicated it would not resume full payments, extending the financial impact.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The financial impact on the tower portfolio transformed from a temporary disruption to a prolonged risk, affecting cash flow projections and impairment assessments."

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT updated its reportable segments to include Latin America property as a distinct segment within its property operations, indicating a strategic emphasis on transparency and management alignment for that region. By 2023, the Latin America property segment had grown in value from $8,666.3 million in 2022 to $9,025.3 million in 2023, representing an increase of $359 million. This growth suggests that AMT increased its focus or investment in the Latin American market during this period, even as other international segments like Asia-Pacific and Africa saw declines in asset value. The increase in Latin America contrasts with reductions in other regions and indicates a possible strategic reallocation of resources toward this segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nCanada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of our operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 97%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview,' we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as, among other things, our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue ('AGR') fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors-Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.' Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations",

In January 2022, a majority of our operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 97%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview,' we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as, among other things, our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue ('AGR') fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors-Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.' Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations",

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right.\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its rightof-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AMT reviewed the network location intangible using cash flow modeling that included tower location, lease rates, and tenant timing assumptions, with general references to tenant attrition and contract non-renewals as impairment indicators.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company maintained the same impairment methodology but introduced a specific example of a major tenant (VIL) failing to meet contractual obligations, indicating a more concrete linkage between tenant risk and asset impairment.",
        "Step 3: The evolution lies in the increased specificity and transparency around tenant-related risks, particularly with VIL's partial payments and failure to resume full payments, which was not present in the 2022 discussion."

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's Data Centers segment was primarily described as part of the company's overall communications real estate portfolio, with a focus on ownership and operation of data center facilities in the U.S. The segment faced risks related to lease renewals and potential disruptions due to landlord dependencies. By 2023, the Data Centers segment had evolved into a more strategically emphasized contributor to revenue growth, with explicit mention of rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual escalations, mark-to-market increases, and interconnection services. This reflects a shift from a passive operational stance to a more proactive growth-oriented strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, the Data Centers segment was described in terms of its physical presence and lease-related risks, without specific revenue metrics or growth strategies.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, the segment was explicitly tied to revenue growth with specific components such as rental and power revenue, lease expansions, and interconnection services.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The segment evolved from a general operational component to a key growth driver with detailed strategic revenue components outlined."

A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nWe do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases. Additionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business.\n\nIf we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated.\n\nOur communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers.\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated a portfolio of 220,131 communications sites, including 1,778 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview' for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in Canada and the United States, which are included in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment, and in Australia, which are included in our Asia-Pacific property segment, and also own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which are included in our Data Centers segment.\n\nOur interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities.\n\nA typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets.\n\n- A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and\n- can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres.\n- A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.\n- A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT monitored Tenant-Related Intangible Assets on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or termination of relationships to assess recoverability through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level monitoring but added more structured detail to the impairment assessment process, explicitly incorporating a cash flow modeling approach that included tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and tenancy duration. Additionally, 2023 introduced a clearer framework for recognizing impairment losses based on the fair value of the asset when the undiscounted cash flows fell below the carrying amount. This represents a refinement and formalization of the methodology described in 2022.",

The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\n\nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset's fair value, as compared to the asset's carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments -Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.\n\nThe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company's exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nFair Value Measurements -The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations -When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, straight-line revenue was listed as a component contributing to revenue growth from 'other items,' alongside pass-through costs and decommissioning. By 2023, straight-line revenue was again included in the same category but with additional context that revenue growth from these items was partially offset by revenue reserve provisions. This indicates a nuanced shift in how AMT accounts for and discloses the impact of straight-line revenue, introducing a more balanced view by acknowledging potential offsets in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, straight-line revenue was disclosed as part of 'other items' contributing positively to revenue growth without mention of any offsetting factors.",

        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a purely additive view of straight-line revenue in 2022 to a more balanced presentation in 2023, indicating a change in internal accounting considerations or external regulatory guidance."

These measures include providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\n\nProperty Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.\n\nThe primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:\n\n- Growth in tenant billings, including:\n- New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ('colocations') and lease amendments;\n- Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and\n- New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n- Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space, power and interconnection services and solutions.\n- Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases ('pass-through'), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.\n\nWe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.\n\nProperty Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites.\n\nBased on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:\n\n- In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.\n- Subscribers' use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.\n- The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.\n- Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy",

Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.\n\nServices Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ('Adjusted EBITDA'), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ('Nareit FFO') attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations ('Consolidated AFFO') and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nNareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Data Centers segment's revenue growth was significantly driven by the acquisitions of two multi-customer U.S. data centers for $200.6 million and the CoreSite Acquisition for $10.4 billion, which added 24 facilities across eight U.S. markets. These acquisitions directly contributed approximately $424.3 million in additional revenues for the year. By 2023, the focus had shifted from acquisition-led growth to organic growth through leasing activity, with revenue growth attributed to new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases, and increased interconnection services. This indicates a strategic evolution from asset acquisition to maximizing revenue from existing data center assets through operational leasing improvements.",

These measures include providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\n\nProperty Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.\n\nThe primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:\n\n- Growth in tenant billings, including:\n- New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ('colocations') and lease amendments;\n- Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and\n- New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n- Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space, power and interconnection services and solutions.\n- Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases ('pass-through'), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.\n\nWe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.\n\nProperty Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites.\n\nBased on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:\n\n- In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.\n- Subscribers' use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.\n- The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.\n- Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage.

By 2023, the Data Centers segment had evolved into a more strategically emphasized contributor to revenue growth, with specific mention of rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations, and increased interconnection services and solutions.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 1.    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBusiness -American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, 'ATC' or the 'Company') is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company's primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting ('AZP') and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company's site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company's customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nThe Company's portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC's principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, the Company's international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of the Company's operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation -The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds (i) a 52% controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe') (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 16) hold the noncontrolling interests) and (ii) a 51% controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. ('Confidence Group') holds the noncontrolling interest). As of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe holds an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 16 for a discussion of changes to the Company's noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nChange in Reportable Segments -During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the Company's acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite,' and the acquisition, the 'CoreSite Acquisition'), the Company updated its reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is within the Company's property operations. The Company will now report its results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada,",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT reviewed tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or termination of relationships, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, tenant-related intangible assets were reported at $35.3 million as part of the fair value of net assets acquired in a transaction, indicating a shift from an impairment-focused review to a more acquisition-driven valuation. This reflects a change in the role of these assets from being primarily risk-managed to being value-associated in the context of asset acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, tenant-related intangible assets were evaluated for impairment based on tenant-specific risks and projected cash flows.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, tenant-related intangible assets were quantified at $35.3 million as part of a broader asset acquisition's fair value assessment.",

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

In January 2022, a majority of our operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 97%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview,' we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as, among other things, our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue ('AGR') fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors-Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.' Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Data Centers segment was newly introduced as a reportable segment following the CoreSite Acquisition, with its financial impact considered historically insignificant due to AMT previously owning only one data center. By 2023, the Data Centers segment had become a recognized contributor to revenue growth, specifically through rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual escalations, mark-to-market increases on renewals, and interconnection services. This reflects a shift from a newly acquired, minor asset base to a more strategically embedded and growth-oriented segment within AMT's operations.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the Data Centers segment was introduced as a new reportable segment following the CoreSite Acquisition, with historical financial impact described as 'insignificant' due to ownership of only one data center prior to Q4 2021.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the Data Centers segment was explicitly cited as a contributor to revenue growth through multiple streams, including new leases, expansions, escalations, and interconnection services, indicating a more mature and integrated business line.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a newly acquired, minor asset in 2022 to a strategically embedded growth engine in 2023 represents a transformation in the Data Centers segment's role within AMT\u2019s property operations."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nCanada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of our operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 97%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview,' we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as, among other things, our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue ('AGR') fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors-Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.' Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Tower Corporation emphasized active monitoring of tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, citing specific indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or termination of relationships. The company assessed recoverability based on projected undiscounted cash flows and recorded impairment charges in 'Other operating expenses' when necessary. However, in 2023, the valuation of tenant-related intangible assets was specifically disclosed at $35.3 billion as part of the intangible assets category, and there was no explicit mention of impairment monitoring or tenant-specific indicators. Instead, the focus shifted to fair value reporting in the context of acquisitions, suggesting a more transactional or valuation-based approach rather than ongoing impairment evaluation.",

The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\n\nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset's fair value, as compared to the asset's carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments -Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.\n\nThe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company's exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nFair Value Measurements -The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations -When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's future growth and expansion initiatives were primarily constrained by the uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court of India\u2019s AGR ruling and the partial payments communicated by VIL, one of its largest customers in India, with an expectation to resume full payments in 2023. However, by 2023, this expectation was not realized as VIL communicated that it would not resume full payments, directly negatively impacting AMT\u2019s ability to fund future growth and expansion initiatives. Additionally, in 2023, new external risks such as inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions were explicitly cited as factors that could impair AMT\u2019s access to capital, further constraining its growth initiatives compared to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, AMT's growth initiatives were dependent on capital availability and tenant performance, with VIL indicating partial payments in 2022 but intent to resume full payments in 2023.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, VIL did not resume full payments as previously expected, and new macroeconomic risks (inflation, rising interest rates) were added as constraints to funding growth initiatives.",
        "Step 3: The change shows a transformation in the nature of risks from primarily India-specific tenant issues in 2022 to a broader set of financial and macroeconomic risks in 2023, with a moderate negative impact on AMT\u2019s growth outlook."

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

By 2023, the Data Centers segment continued to grow, with revenue growth driven by rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases, and increased interconnection services and solutions.

By 2023, these risks were compounded by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit, signaling a material decline in the unit's fair value and directly negatively impacting the company's ability to pursue growth initiatives.

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Data Centers segment was newly introduced as a reportable segment following the CoreSite Acquisition in Q4 2021, with its financial contribution considered insignificant prior to that period. By 2023, the Data Centers segment had become a clearly defined contributor to revenue growth, specifically cited for driving growth through rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases, and increased interconnection services and solutions. This represents a shift from being a newly integrated and relatively minor segment to being explicitly recognized as a meaningful growth driver within property operations.",

        "In 2022, the Data Centers segment was newly added as a reportable segment following the CoreSite Acquisition, with historical contributions described as 'insignificant'.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates' below.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.\n\nIn evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and includes our U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment.\n\nWe also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT reported a straight-line revenue of $499.8 million, which decreased to $472.0 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction of 6%. This decline indicates a moderation in the revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over time, potentially signaling a shift in lease structuring or tenant billing patterns. Additionally, straight-line expense also decreased from $39.6 million in 2022 to $30.2 million in 2023, reinforcing the trend of reduced financial volatility from non-cash adjustments. Together, these changes suggest a more stable or mature leasing environment with less reliance on long-term tenant contracts requiring significant straight-line adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the straight-line revenue and expense figures for 2022 from the 2022 filing, which were $499.8 million and $39.6 million respectively.",
        "Step 2: Identify the corresponding straight-line revenue and expense figures for 2023 from the 2023 filing, which were $472.0 million and $30.2 million respectively.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change in both metrics across years, noting a decrease in both revenue and expense, and interpret this as a potential shift in lease dynamics or revenue recognition practices."

These measures include providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\n\nProperty Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.\n\nThe primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:\n\n- Growth in tenant billings, including:\n- New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ('colocations') and lease amendments;\n- Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and\n- New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n- Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space, power and interconnection services and solutions.\n- Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases ('pass-through'), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.\n\nWe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.\n\nProperty Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites.\n\nBased on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:\n\n- In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.\n- Subscribers' use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.\n- The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.\n- Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy",

      "question": "How has the definition and presentation of AFFO (common stockholders) evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the components excluded or included in the calculation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined as Consolidated AFFO excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in Consolidated AFFO. Consolidated AFFO itself included a broader list of exclusions such as straight-line revenue and expense, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes, non-real estate depreciation, amortization, and accretion, among others. By 2024, the definition of AFFO (common stockholders) remained similar but was refined to explicitly include adjustments for discontinued operations and the impact of noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations on both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments. This indicates a more detailed and inclusive approach in 2024, particularly with respect to discontinued operations, which was not explicitly called out in the 2022 definition.",

        "In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined as Consolidated AFFO excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO and other adjustments, with Consolidated AFFO including a list of specific exclusions and adjustments.",
        "In 2024, the definition of AFFO (common stockholders) explicitly included adjustments for discontinued operations and clarified the impact of noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations on both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments.",
        "The change reflects an evolution in the presentation and specificity of AFFO (common stockholders), with 2024 introducing more granular clarity around the treatment of discontinued operations, suggesting a shift in how the company communicates its financial performance to investors."
