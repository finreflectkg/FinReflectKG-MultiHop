This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG explicitly included leasing prospects as a key component of their impairment evaluation and purchase accounting assumptions, using them alongside forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates. By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments. This reflects a more dynamic and condition-sensitive approach to leasing prospects in 2023 compared to 2022.",

We compared significant assumptions used to external market data to assess whether the assumptions were market supported. We involved our  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in  the  assessment  of  the  methodology  utilized  by  the Partnership  and  to  test  certain  of  the  assumptions  including  capitalization  rates  and  the valuation  of  land.  We  also  compared  the  forecasted  cash  flows  and  operating  income  before depreciation  and  amortization  used  in  the  valuations  to  historical  actual  results  and  marketsupported data, evaluated significant variances, including consideration of the current economic environment, and performed certain sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact on the purchase accounting allocations.  We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data included in the valuation models.\n\n## Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Partnership's consolidated net investment properties totaled $22.3 billion.  In  addition,  a  significant  number  of  the  Partnership's  investments  in  unconsolidated entities and its investments in Kl\u00e9pierre and TRG hold investment properties. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership reviews investment properties for  impairment  on  a  property-by-property  basis  to  identify  and  evaluate  events  or  changes  in circumstances  that indicate the carrying value of an investment property  may  not  be recoverable.  The  Partnership  estimates  undiscounted  cash  flows  of  an  investment  property using  observable  and  unobservable  inputs  such  as  historical  and  forecasted  cash  flows, operating  income  before  depreciation  and  amortization,  estimated  capitalization  rates,  leasing prospects and local market information.\n\nAuditing management's evaluation of investment properties for impairment was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the undiscounted cash flows of an investment property. In  particular,  the  impairment  evaluation  for  investment  properties  was  sensitive  to  significant assumptions  such  as  forecasted  cash  flows  and  operating  income  before  depreciation  and amortization, and capitalization rates, all of which can be affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, demand, and competition.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls  over  the  Partnership's  process  for  evaluating  investment  properties  for  impairment, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.\n\nTo test the Partnership's evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant  assumptions  discussed  above  and  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the underlying data used by management in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, relevant market information, and other applicable sources. We also involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating certain assumptions. In addition, we compared the forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation  and  amortization  to  historical  actual  results  and  evaluated  significant  variances, including  consideration  of  the  current  economic  environment.  As  part  of  our  evaluation,  we assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in the assumptions.",

This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022.

In 2023, the company reported property revenue from Africa at $1,225.6 million, a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022. This indicates a slowdown in growth within the African market between those years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT reviewed tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships. The recoverability was assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this impairment review process but added a more structured evaluation of the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as part of the impairment indicators. Additionally, in 2023, AMT disclosed that impairment charges were recorded in 'Other operating expenses' and referenced note 16 for details, indicating a more formalized and transparent reporting mechanism compared to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, impairment of tenant-related intangible assets was assessed using tenant-specific indicators and undiscounted future cash flows.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the impairment review expanded to include the tenant's ability to meet obligations and included a reference to specific financial reporting in note 16.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more detailed and structured approach to evaluating tenant-related intangible assets, with enhanced financial disclosure."

If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n\n- Impairment of Assets-Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\n\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\n\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\n\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\n\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis.

The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\n\nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset's fair value, as compared to the asset's carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments -Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.\n\nThe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company's exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nFair Value Measurements -The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations -When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations.",

However, in the 2024 10-K filing, the company's projected spending on Start-up capital projects for 2025 was lowered to a range of $50 million to $70 million.

By 2024, the disclosure no longer mentioned the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, suggesting that the company had either completed or abandoned this specific agreement, and instead focused on broader financing activities and debt service obligations without tying them to a named transaction. This evolution reflects a shift from a transaction-specific risk to a more generalized disclosure around leverage and financing.",

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as 'anticipates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects' or similar ex pressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future prospects of growth in the communications infrastructure leasing industry, the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our customers and other competitive and financial pressures, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, the ex pected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business, our expectations for the closing of signed agreements and the expected impacts of such agreements on our business, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future ex penditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, changes in zoning, tax  and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital ex penditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for tax ation as a real estate investment trust ('REIT'), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and technology failures, including cybersecurity and data privacy incidents. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.

      "question": "How did the treatment and presentation of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its reconciliation with other financial metrics?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining how it is calculated from net income by excluding gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, and real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, while also adjusting for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022\u20132024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company primarily defined Nareit FFO and its components in narrative form without specific year-over-year comparisons.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company presented Nareit FFO as part of a detailed financial table showing specific dollar values for 2024, 2023, and 2022, along with percentage changes, indicating a shift toward performance tracking.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a change in emphasis from explaining the metric's definition to showcasing its performance over time, with a 14% increase in Nareit FFO from 2023 to 2024."

The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company's aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nIncome Taxes -As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets' recoverability.\n\nThe Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) -Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company's other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $4.7 billion, $3.8 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nDistributions -As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses ('NOLs').\n\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company's control, including the Company's financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company's existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company's ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company's distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\nAcquisitions -For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted.\n\nThe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the",

When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition, and apply the applicable discount rate.\n\nRevenue -The Company's revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located, the land underlying its customers' sites and the space in its data center facilities (the 'lease component') and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers' equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the 'non-lease component'). Most of the Company's revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with customers that are generally not accounted for as leases.\n\nThe Company's revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index  ('CPI'), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company's tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $277.6 million, $465.4 million and $508.5 million, respectively.\n\nNon-lease property revenueNon-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure.

Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the  leases  when  we  believe  substantially  all  lease  income,  including  the  related  straight-line  rent  receivable,  is probable of collection. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize this variable lease consideration only when each tenant's sales exceed the applicable sales threshold. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of lease income utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.\n\nWe structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs  and  maintenance,  and  advertising  and  promotion  expenses  from  our  tenants. A  substantial  portion  of  our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.  Such property operating expenses  typically  include  utility,  insurance,  security,  janitorial,  landscaping,  food  court  and  other  administrative expenses.  This  significantly  reduces  our  exposure  to  increases  in  costs  and  operating  expenses  resulting  from inflation or otherwise. For substantially all of our leases in the U.S. mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning  with  the  adoption  of  ASC  842.  When  not  reimbursed  by  the  fixed  CAM  component,  CAM  expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures for the property. We accrue all variable reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all of these expenses as variable lease consideration in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We recognize differences  between  estimated  recoveries  and  the  final  billed  amounts  in  the  subsequent  year.  These  differences were  not  material  in  any  period  presented.  Our  advertising  and  promotional  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred. Provisions for credit losses that are not probable of collection are recognized as a reduction of lease income.\n\nIn April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19  on  the  application  of  lease  modification  guidance  in  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC)  842, 'Leases.' The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration.  We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement.\n\nWe  have  agreed  to  deferral  or  abatement  arrangements  with  a  number  of  our  tenants  as  a  result  of  the COVID-19  pandemic.  Discussions  with  our  tenants  are  ongoing  and  may  result  in  further  rent  deferrals,  lease amendments, abatements and/or lease terminations,  as  we  deem  appropriate  on  a  case-by-case  basis  based  on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation. In addition, uncollected rent due from certain of our tenants is subject to ongoing litigation, the outcome of which may affect our ability to collect in full the associated outstanding receivable balances.\n\nIn connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent payments, if we determine that rent payments are probable of collection, we will continue to recognize lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term along  with  associated  tenant  receivables.  However,  if  we  determine  that  such  deferred  rent  payments  or  other accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on the cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against lease  income  in  the  period  of  the  change  in  our  collectability  determination.    Additionally,  our  assessment  of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant's financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and other matters, and our communications and negotiations with the tenant.\n\nWhen a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of  receivable  balances.  Our  ongoing  assessment  incorporates,  among  other  things,  the  timing  of  a  tenant's bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumptions by the tenant in bankruptcy proceedings of leases at the Company's properties on substantially similar terms.

By 2024, SPG provided concrete financial figures showing fixed lease income increased from $3,858,592 in 2022 to $4,145,288 in 2023, and further to $4,365,734 in 2024, indicating a consistent upward trend.

          "chunk_text": "\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  These  judgments  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting  in  a  different  presentation  of  our  financial  statements.  From  time  to  time,  we  reevaluate  our estimates  and  assumptions.  In  the  event  estimates  or  assumptions  prove  to  be  different  from  actual  results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant's financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines in such conditions due to, or amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic.  When a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including, among other things, the timing of a tenant's bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the Company's properties on substantially similar terms.  In the  event  that  we  determine  accrued  receivables  are  not  probable  of  collection,  lease  income  will  be recorded  on  a  cash  basis,  with  the  corresponding  tenant  receivable  and  straight-line  rent  receivable charged  as  a  direct  write-off  against  lease  income  in  the  period  of  the  change  in  our  collectability determination.\n- We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property's operational performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the Company's intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements.  We  measure  any  impairment  of  investment  property  when  the  estimated  undiscounted operating  income  before  depreciation  and  amortization  during  the  anticipated  holding  period  plus  its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  our  investments  may  not  be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less than  their  carrying  value  and  such  impairment  is  other-than-temporary.  Our  evaluation  of  changes  in economic  or  operating  conditions  and  whether  an  impairment  is  other-than-temporary  may  include developing  estimates  of  fair  value,  forecasted  cash  flows  or  operating  income  before  depreciation  and amortization. We estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such  as  operating  income,  hold  periods,  estimated  capitalization  and  discount  rates,  or  relevant  market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments are other-thantemporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review",

The company also discussed its accounting for pandemic-related concessions, such as rent abatements treated as negative variable lease consideration. By 2024, the disclosure became more streamlined, focusing on the categorization of fixed lease income into fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements, both recognized on a straight-line basis, without specific mention of pandemic-related concessions or detailed accounting treatments for rent abatements. This indicates a simplification and refocusing of the disclosure, aligning it more closely with standard lease accounting practices.",

Simon Property Group, L.P.\n\n## (Dollars in thousands, except share, per share, unit and per unit amounts\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and where indicated as in millions or billions)\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the  leases  when  we  believe  substantially  all  lease  income,  including  the  related  straight-line  rent  receivable,  is probable of collection. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize this variable lease consideration only when each tenant's sales exceed the applicable sales threshold. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of lease income utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.\n\nWe structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs  and  maintenance,  and  advertising  and  promotion  expenses  from  our  tenants. A  substantial  portion  of  our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.  Such property operating expenses  typically  include  utility,  insurance,  security,  janitorial,  landscaping,  food  court  and  other  administrative expenses.  This  significantly  reduces  our  exposure  to  increases  in  costs  and  operating  expenses  resulting  from inflation or otherwise. For substantially all of our leases in the U.S. mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning  with  the  adoption  of  ASC  842.  When  not  reimbursed  by  the  fixed  CAM  component,  CAM  expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures for the property. We accrue all variable reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all of these expenses as variable lease consideration in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We recognize differences  between  estimated  recoveries  and  the  final  billed  amounts  in  the  subsequent  year.  These  differences were  not  material  in  any  period  presented.  Our  advertising  and  promotional  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred. Provisions for credit losses that are not probable of collection are recognized as a reduction of lease income.\n\nIn April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19  on  the  application  of  lease  modification  guidance  in  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC)  842, 'Leases.' The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration.  We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement.\n\nWe  have  agreed  to  deferral  or  abatement  arrangements  with  a  number  of  our  tenants  as  a  result  of  the COVID-19  pandemic.  Discussions  with  our  tenants  are  ongoing  and  may  result  in  further  rent  deferrals,  lease amendments, abatements and/or lease terminations,  as  we  deem  appropriate  on  a  case-by-case  basis  based  on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation. In addition, uncollected rent due from certain of our tenants is subject to ongoing litigation, the outcome of which may affect our ability to collect in full the associated outstanding receivable balances.\n\nIn connection with rent deferrals or other accruals of unpaid rent payments, if we determine that rent payments are probable of collection, we will continue to recognize lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term along  with  associated  tenant  receivables.  However,  if  we  determine  that  such  deferred  rent  payments  or  other accrued but unpaid rent payments are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on the cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and deferred rent receivable balances charged as a direct write-off against lease  income  in  the  period  of  the  change  in  our  collectability  determination.    Additionally,  our  assessment  of collectability incorporates information regarding a tenant's financial condition that is obtained from available financial data, the expected outcome of contractual disputes and other matters, and our communications and negotiations with the tenant.\n\nWhen a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of  receivable  balances.  Our  ongoing  assessment  incorporates,  among  other  things,  the  timing  of  a  tenant's bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumptions by the tenant in bankruptcy proceedings of leases at the Company's properties on substantially similar terms.

      "question": "How has Simon Property Group's disclosure and treatment of ground lease expense evolved between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this indicate about the company's reporting approach?",
      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, Simon Property Group provided detailed information about its ground lease commitments, noting that 23 consolidated properties were subject to ground leases with termination dates extending through 2090. The disclosure included specifics about fixed annual rental payments, potential percentage rent components based on property revenues or sales, and the inclusion of escalation clauses in some leases. The ground lease expense was stated to be included in 'other expense.' In contrast, the 2024 10-K filing contains significantly less detail about the ground leases, with only a brief mention that the company incurred ground lease expense, which was again included in 'other expense.' The expense amount itself appears consistent in terms of financial classification between the two years, as it is described as being included in the same expense category. The evolution lies in the depth of disclosure rather than the expense amount itself, suggesting a possible streamlining of reporting without a substantive change in the expense structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the state of disclosure and treatment of ground lease expense in the 2023 filing, including the number of properties, lease terms, and classification of expense.",
        "Step 2: Identify the state of disclosure and treatment of ground lease expense in the 2024 filing, noting the absence of detailed lease terms but the continuation of expense classification.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change as a reduction in the depth of disclosure while maintaining the same expense treatment, indicating a shift in reporting emphasis rather than a change in financial cost."
