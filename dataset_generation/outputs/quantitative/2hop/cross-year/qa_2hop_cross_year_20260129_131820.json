(1)\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix  shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of ex ceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.\n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.\n\n## Returns\n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\n\n## Return on Assets and Return on Investment\n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.",

(1)\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix  shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of ex ceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.\n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.\n\n## Returns\n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\n\n## Return on Assets and Return on Investment\n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the previous year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. The change from a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 to a 20 basis point increase in fiscal 2024 indicates a significant turnaround in gross margin performance year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "\nG ross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales. (1)\n\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 40 and 27 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix  shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 36 and decreased 60 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to higher variable pay as a result of ex ceeding planned performance, increased marketing and higher depreciation expenses. The decrease for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment in the prior year.\n\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales increased 15 and 83 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, due to the factors described above, as well as from strong growth in membership income globally.\n\n## Returns\n\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\n\n## Return on Assets and Return on Investment\n\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\n\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during the period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment contributed 2% to organic sales growth. In 2024, the segment's organic sales growth remained at a low single-digit level, indicating minimal change in its growth trajectory. Despite this stability, the segment's performance lagged behind other business units like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which showed higher growth rates, suggesting that Baby, Feminine & Family Care was not a primary growth driver in 2024.",

These  include  but  are  not  limited  to  incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.\n\nCorporate net sales decreased $164 million to $601 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $1.0 billion due to a loss of $1.4 billion due primarily to the impairment charge of the G illette intangible asset and incremental restructuring charges.\n\n## Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings\n\nThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $659 million, which include foreign currency translation losses recognized as a non-cash charge of approximately $216 million due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Restructuring accruals of $166 million as of June 30, 2024, are classified as current liabilities. Ex cluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria,  approximately  64%  of  the  restructuring  charges  incurred  in  fiscal  2024  either  have  been  or  will  be  settled  with  cash.  Consistent  with  our  policies  for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.\n\nSavings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.\n\n## CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\n\nOperating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",

          "chunk_text": "indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mondel\u0113z explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures, noting in the footnotes that these adjustments were added to the non-GAAP definitions starting in the third quarter of 2021 to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance.

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Revenue' is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations . We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets. (2) (3)\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n- 'Adjusted Operating Income' is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program ; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs , acquisition-related costs, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments ; the operating results of divestitures ; remeasurement of net monetary position ; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts ; impact from resolution of tax matters ; CEO transition remuneration ; impact from pension participation changes ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes ; and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present 'Adjusted Operating Income margin,' which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis . (4) (2) (2) (2) (2) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (3)\n- 'Adjusted EPS' is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures ; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees' significant operating and non-operating items . We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis . (2) (11) (3)\n\n(1)    When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our nonGAAP definitions. In the second quarter of 2021, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (refer to footnote (10) below). In the third quarter of 2021, we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration adjustments (refer to footnote (2) below) and the mark-to-market impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives contracts (refer to footnote (6) below).\n\n(2)    Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet's ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 7, Equity Method Investments , for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.",

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs.

ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our countryspecific incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term using information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g. product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. Nonlease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses (on a straight-line basis) for operating leases. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Software Costs:\n\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. In 2021, we performed a quantitative annual test. For our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a marketbased, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations, and for our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nAnnually we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.",

For short-term operating leases with terms of 12 months or less, we do not recognize right-of-use ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities.

Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present v alue of remaining lease payments ov er the lease term.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded contingent consideration adjustments from their Adjusted Operating Income as part of a list of exclusions that also included items like Simplify to Grow Program impacts and intangible asset impairments. By 2024, the company began disclosing specific contingent consideration adjustments within their Adjusted EPS reconciliation, with a reported impact of $(60) million in 2023 related to acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. This represents a shift from general exclusion to explicit quantification and inclusion in adjusted financial reporting.",

By 2024, contingent consideration adjustments had resulted in a total expense of $72 million, indicating a shift from a potentially positive or neutral impact to a clear net cost.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, AMEA and Latin America, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America. Overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in North America, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for inhome consumption due to the pandemic. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.\n\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $133 million from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\nFavorable currency changes increased operating income by $118 million due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chinese yuan. Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower Simplify to Grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. Adjusted Operating Income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental COVID-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.",

The GBS  organization  is  responsible  for  providing  world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&amp;G.\n\n## Strategic Focus\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  aspires  to  serve  the  world's  consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country  in  which  we  compete  and,  as  a  result,  deliver  total shareholder  return  in  the  top  one-third  of  our  peer  group. Delivering  and  sustaining  leadership  levels  of  shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.\n\nThe Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to P&amp;G's strengths. Our focused portfolio  of  businesses  consists  of  ten  product  categories where  P&amp;G has  leading  market  positions,  strong  brands  and consumer-meaningful product technologies.\n\nWithin these  categories,  our  strategic  choices  are  focused  on delighting and winning with consumers.  Our consumers are at the  center  of  everything  we  do.   We  win  with  consumers  by delivering  irresistible  superiority  across  five  key  vectors  product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution  and  value.  Winning  with  consumers  around  the world  and  against  our  best  competitors  requires  superior innovation.  Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&amp;G's  lifeblood.    Superior  products  delivered  with  superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&amp;G.\n\nOngoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced  top-  and  bottom-line  growth,  cash  generation  and value creation objectives.    Productivity  improvement  enables investments  to  strengthen  the  superiority  of  our  brands  via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and  effective  supply  chains,  equity  and  awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&amp;D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange  impacts).    Our  objective  is  to  drive  productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending.\n\nWe  act  with  agility  and  are  constructively  disrupting  our highly  competitive  industry  and  the  way  we  do  business, including  how  we  innovate,  communicate  and  leverage  new technologies, to create more value.\n\nWe are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.\n\nAdditionally, within these strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen our performance going forward. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as  an  additional  driver  of  superior  performing  products  and packaging  innovations,  2)  increasing  digital  acumen  to  drive consumer  and  customer  preference,  reduce  cost  and  enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapting to a new reality and 4) delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.\n\nWe believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.\n\nThe Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:\n\n- Organic  sales  growth  above  market  growth  rates  in  the categories and geographies in which we compete;\n- Core  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  growth  of  mid-to-high single digits; and\n- Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.\n\nDuring  periods  of  significant  macroeconomic  pressures,  we intend  to  maintain  a  disciplined  approach  to  investing  in  our business, which may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Adjusted OCI increased by $90 million (5.5%), primarily driven by higher pricing and lower costs, which were partially offset by lower shipment volume and mix ($104 million impact). In contrast, in 2024, Adjusted OCI increased by $89 million (5.2%), driven solely by higher pricing, including higher promotional investments, despite facing similar headwinds from lower shipment volume and a higher percentage of on! shipment volume relative to MST. This indicates that the company maintained pricing power but faced increased costs or reduced volume, neutralizing some of the benefits from pricing actions.",

        "Step 3: The change shows a shift from cost containment aiding Adjusted OCI in 2023 to no such benefit in 2024, with the same volume/mix challenges persisting, indicating increased cost pressures or reduced operating leverage."

This indicates a weakening in the company's competitive position in the oral tobacco segment over this period. Specific brands like Copenhagen and Skoal experienced notable declines, with Copenhagen dropping from 23.5% to 19.1%, and Skoal from 9.3% to 7.6%.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Total PMI Net Revenues were $31.405 billion, with combustible products contributing $22.190 billion and reduced-risk products contributing $9.115 billion. By 2023, Total PMI Net Revenues increased to $35.174 billion, with combustible products contributing $22.334 billion and smoke-free products contributing $12.840 billion. This represents a shift in the company's revenue mix, with smoke-free products showing significant growth in their contribution compared to combustible products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services, but it was embedded within a broader list that included gasoline, pharmacy, optical, and food court services. By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services without specific emphasis or separation from other offerings like pharmacy or food court.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Tire Installation was still categorized under warehouse ancillary services but was more distinctly highlighted, indicating a more prominent or intentional role in Costco\u2019s service portfolio.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in how Costco communicates Tire Installation to stakeholders, suggesting a more strategic or differentiated service offering over time."

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.

      "answer": "In 2023, PM's net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 1.9%, driven by higher cigarette, HTU, and device volumes, but partly offset by unfavorable device and cigarette mix. In contrast, in 2024, the increase in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, was significantly higher at 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a substantial improvement in revenue performance from 2023 to 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as 'Swiss tax reform'. Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn March 4, 2020, we participated in a secondary offering of KDP shares and sold approximately 6.8 million shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 0.5% to 13.1% of the total outstanding shares. We received $185 million of proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of $71 million (or $54 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million (or $18 million after-tax) related to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 13.8% to 13.6%.\n\n## JDE Peet's Transaction:\n\nIn May 2020, JDE Peet's B.V. (renamed JDE Peet's N.V. immediately prior to Settlement (as defined below), 'JDE Peet's') consummated the offering, listing and trading of its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, a regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. In connection with this transaction, JDE Peet's and the selling shareholders, including us, agreed to sell at a price of \u20ac31.50 per ordinary share a total of approximately 82.1 million ordinary shares, including ordinary shares subject to an over-allotment option. The ordinary shares were listed and first traded on May 29, 2020, and payment for, and delivery of, the ordinary shares sold in the offering (excluding ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option) took place on June 2, 2020 ('Settlement').\n\nPrior to Settlement, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in JDE for a 26.5% equity interest in JDE Peet's. We did not invest new capital in connection with the transaction and the exchange was accounted for as a change in interest transaction. Upon Settlement, we sold approximately 9.7 million of our ordinary shares in JDE Peet's in the offering for gross proceeds of \u20ac304 million ($343 million). We subsequently sold approximately 1.4 million additional shares and received gross proceeds of \u20ac46 million ($51 million) upon exercise of the over-allotment option. Following Settlement and the exercise of the over-allotment option, we held a 22.9% equity interest in JDE Peet's. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded a preliminary gain of $121 million, net of $33 million released from accumulated other comprehensive losses, and $48 million of transaction costs. During the third quarter of 2020, we increased our preliminary gain by $10 million to $131 million.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, we issued \u20ac300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDE Peet's ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of \u20ac35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for JDE Peet's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 7% of our equity interest in JDE Peet's. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for further details on this transaction.\n\nAs was the case in our ownership interest in JDE, we have significant influence with respect to JDE Peet's, and we will continue to account for our investment in JDE Peet's under the equity method, resulting in recognizing our share of JDE Peet's earnings within our earnings and our share of JDE Peet's dividends within our cash flows.\n\n## Summary Financial Information for Equity Method Investments:\n\nSummarized financial information related to our equity method investments is reflected below.\n\n",

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Revenue' is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations . We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets. (2) (3)\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n- 'Adjusted Operating Income' is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program ; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs , acquisition-related costs, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments ; the operating results of divestitures ; remeasurement of net monetary position ; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts ; impact from resolution of tax matters ; CEO transition remuneration ; impact from pension participation changes ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes ; and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present 'Adjusted Operating Income margin,' which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis . (4) (2) (2) (2) (2) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (3)\n- 'Adjusted EPS' is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures ; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees' significant operating and non-operating items . We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis . (2) (11) (3)\n\n(1)    When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our nonGAAP definitions. In the second quarter of 2021, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (refer to footnote (10) below). In the third quarter of 2021, we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration adjustments (refer to footnote (2) below) and the mark-to-market impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives contracts (refer to footnote (6) below).\n\n(2)    Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet's ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 7, Equity Method Investments , for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the remeasurement of net monetary position contributed $0.03 to Adjusted EPS, while in 2023, the contribution increased to $0.07, representing a $0.04 increase. This indicates a growing impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on Mondel\u0113z International's financial performance, potentially signaling increased exposure to currency volatility in its international operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the remeasurement of net monetary position had a $0.03 impact on Adjusted EPS, as disclosed in the reconciliation table.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the same metric had a $0.07 impact on Adjusted EPS, showing a clear increase in its influence.",
        "Step 3: The change from $0.03 to $0.07 indicates a significant increase in the financial impact of currency remeasurement, suggesting a shift in the company's exposure to foreign exchange movements."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Revenue' is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations . We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets. (2) (3)\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n- 'Adjusted Operating Income' is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program ; gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs , acquisition-related costs, and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments ; the operating results of divestitures ; remeasurement of net monetary position ; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts ; impact from resolution of tax matters ; CEO transition remuneration ; impact from pension participation changes ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes ; and costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction. We also present 'Adjusted Operating Income margin,' which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis . (4) (2) (2) (2) (2) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (3)\n- 'Adjusted EPS' is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures ; and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees' significant operating and non-operating items . We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis . (2) (11) (3)\n\n(1)    When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our nonGAAP definitions. In the second quarter of 2021, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (refer to footnote (10) below). In the third quarter of 2021, we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration adjustments (refer to footnote (2) below) and the mark-to-market impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives contracts (refer to footnote (6) below).\n\n(2)    Divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. As we record our share of KDP and JDE Peet's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any KDP or JDE Peet's ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. We made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures , and Note 7, Equity Method Investments , for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.",

      "question": "How has Target's treatment and financial impact of inventory shrink evolved from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Target noted that inventory shrink had a direct adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition, with elevated levels of shrink due to theft, damage, and organized retail crime. The company indicated that these elevated shrink levels had already affected performance and could continue to do so, potentially leading to store closures and asset impairments. By 2024, inventory shrink was explicitly listed as a component of cost of sales, indicating that it was a recurring and quantifiable expense within merchandising costs. This shift from a risk factor in 2023 to a recognized and categorized cost in 2024 suggests that inventory shrink had become a more structurally embedded expense within Target's operations, rather than just a risk that could potentially affect future performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, inventory shrink was described as a growing risk that negatively impacted results of operations and financial condition, with elevated levels observed.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, inventory shrink was explicitly listed as a component of cost of sales, indicating it was a recognized and recurring financial expense.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from inventory shrink being a potential risk to a consistent, categorized cost within the company's financial structure."

      "answer": "In 2023, Target reported experiencing higher inventory shrink as a percentage of sales compared to historical levels, with significantly elevated shrink rates at certain stores. The company noted that this trend was industry-wide and had an adverse impact on its results of operations, including impairment of long-lived assets. In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly listed as a component of the cost of sales, indicating it is now formally recognized and accounted for as a direct cost of merchandise operations. This shift reflects a more structured financial acknowledgment of inventory shrink within the company's expense framework.",

        "In 2023, inventory shrink was described as being at elevated levels and having an adverse impact on operations, including asset impairment.",
        "In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly categorized under cost of sales, indicating a formalized financial treatment.",
        "The evolution from a noted operational issue in 2023 to a structured cost component in 2024 reflects a strategic shift in how Target accounts for and manages inventory shrink."

Our inv estment policy is designed to preserv e principal  and  liquidity  of  our  short-term  inv estments.  T his  policy  allows  inv estments  in  large  money  market  funds  or  in  highly  rated  direct  short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our inv estments in indiv idual funds or instruments.\n\n## Operating Cash Flow s\n\nCash flows prov ided by operating activ ities were $7.4 billion in 2024 compared with $8.6 billion in 2023. T he operating cash flow decrease is primarily due to higher income tax payments and the combined impact of inv entory and accounts payable activ ity.\n\n## Inventory\n\nYear-end inv entory was $12.7 billion in 2024, compared with $11.9 billion in 2023. The increase in inv entory lev els reflects\n\n- earlier inv entory receipts compared to the prior year, including to support merchandising strategies; and\n- inv entory inv estments in select merchandise categories to support sales growth and an improv ed in-stock position.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION A ND A NA LYSIS",

In fiscal year 2024, this trend continued as the total nonvested units further increased from 3,796 to 4,549, while the grant date fair value slightly fluctuated from $171.61 to $169.59.

      "answer": "In 2023, the Company's working capital as a percentage of Net Sales was (1.4)%, driven by higher accounts payable and accruals and lower inventory. By 2024, this metric had decreased further to (5.2)%, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accruals. This indicates a deepening negative working capital position, suggesting the company is increasingly financing its operations through liabilities rather than liquid assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations increased 10% to $4,107 in 2024 as compared to $3,745 in 2023, primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (5.2)% in 2024 and (1.4)% in 2023. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to higher accounts payable and accruals. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (ex cluding short-term debt).\n\nInvesting activities used $534 of cash in 2024 compared to $742 during 2023.\n\nCapital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2024 were $561, a decrease from $705 in 2023. Capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be approximately 3.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax  returns.\n\nFinancing activities used $3,389 of cash during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2,793 during 2023. The increase in cash used was primarily due to higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,941 as of December 31, 2024, as compared to $8,239 as of December 31, 2023, and total debt decreased to $7,949 as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $8,549 as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed at maturity $500 of ten-year Medium-Term Notes with a fixed coupon of 3.25%. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fix ed coupon rate of 4.600%. The Company's debt issuances support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,725 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026. In November 2023, the Company extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2028. In November 2024, the Company further extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2029. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material.\n\nDomestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $936 and $906 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2024 and 2023 were $1,710 and $1,800, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).",

      "answer": "In 2023, Hill's Pet Nutrition accounted for 23% of the total pretax charges related to the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, indicating a significant portion of restructuring efforts were focused on this segment. By 2024, this allocation dropped to 6% of the charges, showing a clear reduction in restructuring activity within Hill's Pet Nutrition.

      "answer": "In 2023, QFNA was described as a reportable segment with accountability for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role in the company's organizational structure and performance metrics. However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, QFNA was identified as a reportable segment and was held accountable for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role within the company's structure.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, QFNA received only $11 million in allocation, significantly lower than other key segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million), suggesting a reduced emphasis.",
        "Step 3: The drop in allocation and accountability indicates a potential shift in strategic focus away from QFNA, as the company appears to be investing more heavily in other divisions."

      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that substantially all vendor income\u2014arising from volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising activities\u2014was recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, vendor income was primarily recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales, with advertising-related vendor reimbursements offsetting SG&A expenses, and specific advertising cost figures were disclosed ($1.5B, $1.5B, $1.6B).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, vendor income was split in its treatment: income not tied to specific advertising reimbursements reduced Cost of Sales, while that which did was offset against advertising costs within SG&A.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation in how vendor income is classified and accounted for, moving from a general reduction of Cost of Sales to a more differentiated model based on the nature of the income."

Consideration Received from Vendors\n\nWe receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and  advertising  activities  and  for  our  compliance  programs,  referred  to  as  \"vendor  income.\"  Additionally,  under  our  compliance programs,  vendors  are  charged  for  merchandise  shipments  that  do  not  meet  our  requirements  (violations),  such  as  late  or incomplete shipments. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Note 11 provides additional information.\n\n## 7. Advertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs, which primarily consist of digital advertisements and media broadcast, are generally expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement. Reimbursements from vendors that are for specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as offsets of these advertising costs within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A Expenses). Net advertising costs were $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## 8. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).\n\n",

It also appeared in the selling, general, and administrative expenses section, where it was offset by advertising costs and described as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs. By 2024, the structure remained largely similar, with Vendor Income still included in cost of sales under the same description. However, in the 2024 filing, the term 'Merchandising cost of sales' was introduced, which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as merchandise costs and supply chain and digital fulfillment costs. This evolution indicates a more granular classification of Vendor Income within cost of sales while maintaining its dual role in offsetting advertising expenses in SG&A.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs associated with the conflict in Ukraine, including asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables, from non-GAAP operating results to facilitate comparisons of ongoing performance. By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results. This marks a shift from exclusion in 2023 to explicit recognition and quantification in 2024, indicating a change in how these costs were treated and communicated.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs such as asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables from non-GAAP operating results, indicating a policy of isolating these costs to evaluate ongoing performance.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific amount of $4 million in incremental costs directly tied to the war in Ukraine, showing that these costs were no longer fully excluded and were instead explicitly reported within operating results.",
        "Step 3: The change in treatment from exclusion in 2023 to explicit disclosure in 2024 indicates a shift in how MDLZ categorized and reported war-related costs, moving from isolation to inclusion within operating performance metrics."

      "answer": "In 2023, Mondel\u0113z International reported no financial impact from pension participation changes, as noted in the Adjusted Operating Income table where the value was listed as $0 million. In 2024, the company disclosed a $0.01 per diluted share adjustment related to pension participation changes in its EPS reconciliation table. This indicates that the company began recognizing a minor pension-related adjustment in its earnings per share calculations, suggesting a change in how pension impacts are accounted for or have become material enough to report in the context of diluted EPS.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the impact from pension participation changes was listed as $0 million in the Adjusted Operating Income table, indicating no measurable financial impact.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company disclosed a $0.01 per diluted share adjustment related to pension participation changes in its EPS reconciliation, showing a newly recognized impact.",
        "Step 3: The change from $0 million in 2023 to a $0.01 per diluted share adjustment in 2024 indicates that pension-related accounting adjustments have evolved, potentially reflecting a shift in pension participation or accounting treatment."

      "question": "How did the treatment and impact of extreme pricing in Argentina on Organic Net Revenue evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about MDLZ's approach to hyperinflationary markets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the treatment and impact of Organic Net Revenue in 2023, including the absence of any exclusion for extreme pricing in Argentina.",
        "Step 2: Identify the change in 2024, where MDLZ excluded extreme pricing in Argentina from Organic Net Revenue and began separately disclosing its impact.",

For additional information, see Item  1A, Risk Factors ,  including the risk entitled ' The war in Ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations. '\n\n## Developments in the Middle East\n\nIn  October 2023, conflict dev eloped in the  Middle  East between  Hamas and  Israel, and has expanded to other parts of the region.  During 2024, we experienced  sales  impacts  related  to  this  conflict  in  certain  AMEA  markets,  but  this  did  not  hav e  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of operations or financial condition. We continue to ev aluate the impacts of these dev elopments on our business and we cannot predict if it will hav e a significant impact in the future.\n\n## ERP System Implementation\n\nIn  July  2024, our  Board of  Directors approv ed funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply  chain  systems  (the  'ERP  System  Implementation').  The  ERP  System  Implementation  spending  comprises  both  capital  expenditures  and operating  expenses,  of  which  a  majority  is  expected  to  relate  to  operating  expenses.  T he  operating  expenses  associated  with  the  ERP  System Implementation  represent  incremental  transformational  costs  abov e  the  normal  ongoing  lev el  of  spending  on  information  technology  to  support operations. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented by region in sev eral phases with spending occurring ov er the next fiv e years, with  expected  completion  by  year-end  2028.  Refer  to Non-GAAP  financial  measures and  Note  1, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies for additional information.\n\n## Extreme Price Growth in Argentina\n\nDuring December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly dev alued. The peso's dev aluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases  in  excess  of  26%  year-ov er-year  (\"extreme  pricing\")  in  Argentina,  from  these  measures  beginning  in  Q1  2024.  T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&amp;A discussion, \"currency-related items\" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information.\n\nCurrency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2024 as follows:\n\n- Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfav orable currency-related items of $710 million (2.0 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,877 million (5.2 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (3.2 pp).  In  Emerging  Markets, unfav orable currencyrelated items of $778 million (5.6 pp) were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $1,945 million (13.9 pp), partially offset by extreme pricing of $1,167 million (8.3 pp). In Dev eloped Markets, fav orable currency-related items of $68 million (0.3 pp) were driv en by fav orable currency translation rate changes.\n- Adjusted Operating Income: Unfav orable currency-related items of $191 million were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $460 million, partially offset by extreme pricing of $269 million.\n- Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.12 were driv en by unfav orable currency translation rate changes of $0.32, partially offset by extreme pricing of $0.20.",

      "answer": "In 2023, mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities were excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they were not considered indicative of underlying operations. In 2024, this exclusion was maintained and further clarified as part of the non-recurring adjustments to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. The change reflects a more explicit justification for the exclusion in 2024, emphasizing the non-recurring nature of these items and their lack of relevance to ongoing operational performance.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, MDLZ excluded mark-to-market unrealized and realized gains or losses on marketable securities from non-GAAP financial measures, citing that they were not indicative of underlying operations.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company continued to exclude these items but added a new rationale, describing them as non-recurring and stating that excluding them better facilitates comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods.",

T hese expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program , accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP  financial system s and various other expenses, all associated with the im plem entation of our inform ation technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from  our non-GAAP  financial m easures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\n(17) I n  the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude m ark-to-m arket unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our m arketable securities from  our non-G AAP  earnings m easures. T hese m arketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\n(18) We have excluded the initial im pacts from  enacted tax law changes. I nitial im pacts include item s such as the rem easurem ent of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from  the 2017 U .S. tax reform . W e exclude initial im pacts from  enacted tax law changes from  our Adjusted E P S as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law.\n\n(19) We exclude gains and losses on equity m ethod transactions including im pairm ents of our equity m ethod investm ents. I n addition, we also exclude from  our non-G AAP financial m easures any gains or losses realized on econom ic hedges on sales proceeds from  our equity m ethod investm ent transactions, which have been recorded in Interest and other expense, net . T hese item s are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding  U.S.  GAAP financial measures, prov ides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures v ary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that hav e an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by ev aluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully ev aluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K, which can be found abov e under Consolidated Results of Operations .",

      "answer": "In 2023, Mondel\u0113z International explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments as part of its non-GAAP financial measures, specifically in the definition of Adjusted Operating Income. However, in 2024, the company disclosed a contingent consideration adjustment expense of $72 million related to acquisition integration costs. This marks a shift from exclusion to inclusion and quantification of such adjustments in financial reporting, indicating a change in how the company accounts for these items in its non-GAAP performance evaluation.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company explicitly stated that contingent consideration adjustments were excluded from Adjusted Operating Income.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company reported a specific contingent consideration adjustment of $72 million as part of its financial results.",

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).",

      "answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nterm net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars.

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola's Net Operating Revenues were positively impacted by favorable channel and package mix, particularly due to the reopening of Costa retail stores and recovery in away-from-home channels. Additionally, foreign currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues by 1 percent due to a weaker U.S. dollar against several key currencies. However, in 2023, the narrative shifted significantly, with several risks identified that could negatively impact revenues, including labor cost increases, potential strikes affecting supply chains, declining consumer demand for sweetened beverages due to health concerns, and evolving consumer preferences that the company might not effectively address. These combined risks indicate a shift from growth-enabling factors to potential headwinds.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Coca-Cola experienced favorable channel and package mix effects, especially from the reopening of Costa retail stores and foreign exchange benefits.",

          "chunk_text": "- Global Ventures - favorable channel mix primarily due to the reopening of Costa retail stores, partially offset by unfavorable product mix; and\n- Bottling Investments - favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.\n\nThe favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December 31, 2021 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021 and the larger impact of shelter-inplace and social distancing requirements in 2020.\n\nForeign currency fluctuations increased our consolidated net operating revenues by 1 percent. This favorable impact was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency fluctuations will have a negative impact on our full year 2022 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

The 2022 filing primarily described how net operating revenues were generated through concentrate and finished product operations, with no explicit mention of labor-related risks. However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims. This represents a new risk factor introduced in 2023 related to labor disruptions affecting revenue streams.",

In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited ('Costa'). These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment.\n\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading 'Our Business - General' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners ('Coca-Cola system'), refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Beverage Volume' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\n\n- sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes,  Sprite and Thums Up; 1\n- hydration, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, do\u011fadan, Dasani, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glac\u00e9au smartwater, glac\u00e9au vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and\n- nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.\n\nSchweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States. 1\n\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic partnerships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation ('Monster'), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\n\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\n\n## Distribution System\n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of 2.1 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 31.3 billion and 29.0 billion unit cases of our products in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. In 2021, unit case volume in the United States",

      "question": "How did the specific factors affecting Coca-Cola's net operating revenues evolve between 2022 and 2023, based on the distinct disclosures in each year's 10-K filing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola disclosed that foreign currency contracts had a direct impact on net operating revenues, with a gain of $36 million recognized in OCI and a reclassification loss of $77 million into income. In contrast, the 2023 filing did not mention foreign currency contracts affecting net operating revenues. Instead, it highlighted new risk factors such as labor unrest potentially impairing supply chain operations, shifting consumer preferences toward health and wellness, and concerns about product safety and ingredient transparency, all of which could negatively impact net operating revenues. This indicates a shift from financial instrument-related revenue impacts in 2022 to operational and demand-side risks in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, foreign currency contracts directly affected net operating revenues with specific dollar amounts disclosed in OCI and income reclassifications",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, the focus shifted to operational risks like labor relations, consumer preferences, and product safety concerns as potential negative impacts on net operating revenues",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The nature of revenue risks fundamentally changed from financial market exposures (currency contracts) to operational and demand-side factors affecting revenue generation"

      "question": "How did the factors influencing net operating revenues evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of foreign currency fluctuations and external risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted net operating revenues by 1%, primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar against currencies like the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso. However, in 2023, the strengthening U.S. dollar against major currencies and large developing countries' currencies introduced a material adverse effect on financial results, with the company noting increased exposure despite hedging strategies. Additionally, 2023 introduced new risk factors such as regulatory compliance costs and intellectual property threats, which were not highlighted as significant in 2022, indicating a shift in the nature of risks affecting net operating revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, foreign exchange had a favorable 1% impact on net operating revenues due to a weaker U.S. dollar against several key currencies.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, the company reported that a strengthening U.S. dollar could materially affect financial results and introduced new external risks such as intellectual property and regulatory compliance.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The impact of foreign currency shifted from a positive influence in 2022 to a potential negative in 2023, and the risk profile expanded to include more regulatory and legal threats affecting net operating revenues."

          "chunk_text": "- Global Ventures - favorable channel mix primarily due to the reopening of Costa retail stores, partially offset by unfavorable product mix; and\n- Bottling Investments - favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.\n\nThe favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December 31, 2021 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021 and the larger impact of shelter-inplace and social distancing requirements in 2020.\n\nForeign currency fluctuations increased our consolidated net operating revenues by 1 percent. This favorable impact was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency fluctuations will have a negative impact on our full year 2022 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contracts positively impacted net operating revenues by $6 million, indicating a minor beneficial effect from currency fluctuations. In contrast, 2023 disclosures highlighted potential negative impacts on net operating revenues from labor-related risks, such as strikes or work stoppages, and consumer-related risks, including shifting preferences and health concerns around sweetened beverages. These represent a shift from direct financial instrument impacts to operational and market-based risks affecting revenues.",

        "Step 1: Identify the nature of net operating revenue factors in 2022 by examining the impact of foreign currency contracts.",

For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a $0.4 billion non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020.\n\nOperating income for fiscal 2022 included a $0.3 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and fiscal 2021 included a $0.2 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Target reported that the average transaction amount contributed minimally to comparable sales growth, with a 0.4% increase in that metric, as noted in the 2022 10-K filing. This suggested that sales growth was primarily driven by transaction frequency (traffic) rather than spending per visit. However, by 2023, Target explicitly emphasized the average transaction amount as a key strategic lever for long-term profitability, noting that their ability to differentiate the shopping experience through assortment, price, and convenience would drive increased spending per visit. This shift reflects a transformation in strategic focus from primarily driving traffic to also prioritizing higher customer spend per transaction.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that it forecasted vendor income collections using historical trending and data, with the assumption that year-end receivables would largely be collected within the following fiscal quarter. The company did not expect significant changes in these assumptions. By 2023, the vendor income receivable had grown to $513 million, and the estimation process became more complex and audit-intensive. The auditing process now involved extensive verification of inputs used in the receivable model, including testing the nature and source of vendor-sponsored programs, recalculating earned vendor income, and analyzing the time period over which collections were earned. Sensitivity analyses and post-year-end collections verification were also introduced to assess the accuracy of the estimates, indicating a more rigorous and evolved estimation and auditing approach.",

Consideration Received from Vendors\n\nWe receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and  advertising  activities  and  for  our  compliance  programs,  referred  to  as  \"vendor  income.\"  Additionally,  under  our  compliance programs,  vendors  are  charged  for  merchandise  shipments  that  do  not  meet  our  requirements  (violations),  such  as  late  or incomplete shipments. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Note 11 provides additional information.\n\n## 7. Advertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs, which primarily consist of digital advertisements and media broadcast, are generally expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement. Reimbursements from vendors that are for specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as offsets of these advertising costs within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A Expenses). Net advertising costs were $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## 8. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).\n\n",

      "question": "How did the contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about Target's pricing strategy and consumer response during these periods?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the average transaction amount contributed positively to comparable sales growth with a 0.4% increase, indicating that consumers were spending slightly more per transaction. However, in 2023, the average transaction amount decreased by 1.4%, becoming a drag on comparable sales performance. This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the average transaction amount contributed +0.4% to comparable sales, as shown in the table on page 22 of the 2022 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the average transaction amount declined by 1.4%, as stated in the Financial Summary section of the 2023 10-K filing, negatively impacting comparable sales.",
        "Step 3: The change from a positive to a negative contribution indicates a shift in consumer spending behavior and a corresponding adjustment in Target's pricing and promotional strategies to emphasize value and affordability."

North America market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.\n\n## Enterprise Markets\n\nEnterprise Markets are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific countries, supported by SBU-agreed innovation and supply chain plans,  along  with  scaled  services  like  planning, distribution and customer management.\n\n## Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate  Functions  provides  company-level  strategy  and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources, information technology and legal services.\n\n## Global Business Services\n\nGlobal Business Services provides scaled services in technology,  process  and  data  tools  to  enable  the  SBUs,  the EMs  and  CF  to  better  serve  consumers  and  customers.  The GBS  organization  is  responsible  for  providing  world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&amp;G.\n\n## Strategic Focus\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  aspires  to  serve  the  world's  consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country  in  which  we  compete  and,  as  a  result,  deliver  total shareholder  return  in  the  top  one-third  of  our  peer  group. Delivering  and  sustaining  leadership  levels  of  shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.\n\nThe Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to P&amp;G's strengths. Our focused portfolio  of  businesses  consists  of  ten  product  categories where  P&amp;G has  leading  market  positions,  strong  brands  and consumer-meaningful product technologies.\n\nWithin these  categories,  our  strategic  choices  are  focused  on delighting and winning with consumers.  Our consumers are at the  center  of  everything  we  do.   We  win  with  consumers  by delivering  irresistible  superiority  across  five  key  vectors  product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution  and  value.  Winning  with  consumers  around  the world  and  against  our  best  competitors  requires  superior innovation.  Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&amp;G's  lifeblood.    Superior  products  delivered  with  superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&amp;G.\n\nOngoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced  top-  and  bottom-line  growth,  cash  generation  and value creation objectives.    Productivity  improvement  enables investments  to  strengthen  the  superiority  of  our  brands  via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and  effective  supply  chains,  equity  and  awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&amp;D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange  impacts).    Our  objective  is  to  drive  productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending.\n\nWe  act  with  agility  and  are  constructively  disrupting  our highly  competitive  industry  and  the  way  we  do  business, including  how  we  innovate,  communicate  and  leverage  new technologies, to create more value.\n\nWe are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.\n\nAdditionally, within these strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen our performance going forward. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as  an  additional  driver  of  superior  performing  products  and packaging  innovations,  2)  increasing  digital  acumen  to  drive consumer  and  customer  preference,  reduce  cost  and  enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapting to a new reality and 4) delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.\n\nWe believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.\n\nThe Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:\n\n- Organic  sales  growth  above  market  growth  rates  in  the categories and geographies in which we compete;\n- Core  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  growth  of  mid-to-high single digits; and\n- Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.\n\nDuring  periods  of  significant  macroeconomic  pressures,  we intend  to  maintain  a  disciplined  approach  to  investing  in  our business, which may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm.",

(1)\n\n## 2024 Compared with 2023\n\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $552 million (2.5%), due primarily to lower shipment volume ($2,528 million), partially offset by higher pricing ($1,968 million), which includes higher promotional investments.\n\nReported OCI increased $151 million (1.4%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration and research costs ($56 million), partially offset by lower shipment volume ($1,648 million), higher per unit settlement charges and manufacturing costs ($198 million) and 2024 exit costs related to the Initiative.\n\nAdjusted OCI increased $212 million (2.0%), due primarily to higher pricing, which includes higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration and research costs ($86 million), partially offset by lower shipment volume, higher per unit settlement charges and manufacturing costs.\n\nMarketing, administration and research costs for the smokeable products segment include PM USA's cost of administering and litigating product liability claims. Litigation defense costs are influenced by a number of factors, including the number and types of cases filed, the number of cases tried annually, the results of trials and appeals, the development of the law controlling relevant legal issues, and litigation strategy and tactics. For further discussion on these matters, see Note 20 and Item 3. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, product liability defense costs for PM USA were $125 million and $133 million, respectively. The factors that have influenced past product liability costs are ex pected to continue to influence future costs. We do not expect future product liability defense costs for our smokeable products segment to be significantly different from product liability defense costs incurred in 2024.",

This represents a $2 million increase in AMESA's financial involvement in such activities over the two-year period.

In contrast, the cigarette market share slightly declined from 23.8% in 2022 to 23.5% in 2024.

However, the 2024 filing highlights several operational and integration-related risks that could threaten this growth trajectory. Specifically, KO notes that challenges in integrating acquired businesses\u2014such as delays in realizing cost synergies, difficulties in extending internal controls, and potential increases in costs due to integration issues\u2014could negatively affect financial results. Additionally, risks related to third-party service providers failing to meet commitments, labor unrest affecting manufacturing and bottling operations, and the inability to offset cost increases through pricing or productivity initiatives all pose direct threats to maintaining revenue momentum. These risks, if realized, could materially reduce or even reverse the upward trend in net operating revenues observed in 2023.",

Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety and sustainability) to acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we ex pect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, or experience adverse events, our business could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other ex ternal business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

      "question": "How did the geographic diversification of Coca-Cola's net operating revenues in 2023 contribute to the increased emphasis on foreign currency exchange rate risk in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola disclosed detailed financial statements, including Note 3, which highlighted the company's global revenue streams and geographic diversification of net operating revenues. This laid the foundation for understanding the company's exposure to international markets. In 2024, the company specifically noted that $28.7 billion of net operating revenues came from operations outside the United States, directly linking this geographic diversification to a material risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increased emphasis on foreign exchange risk in 2024 is a direct evolution of the prior year's geographic revenue exposure, as a stronger U.S. dollar could significantly impact the translated value of these international revenues.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Coca-Cola provided a comprehensive breakdown of its financials, including geographic revenue distribution in Note 3, establishing the global nature of its net operating revenues.",
        "In 2024, the company quantified its international revenues at $28.7 billion and explicitly tied this geographic exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, indicating a material impact on financial results.",
        "The evolution from a general geographic revenue disclosure in 2023 to a specific risk factor in 2024 shows how the company's global footprint led to a heightened focus on currency risk management."

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, extended producer responsibility, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices (including human rights), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence), personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital ex penditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola's net operating revenues were primarily influenced by variable consideration tied to performance obligations, such as customer sales volumes, pricing, and channel mix, as detailed in the revenue recognition policies. These internal, contract-based mechanisms were central to how revenue was estimated and recognized. By 2024, external macroeconomic and regulatory factors became more prominent risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (notably with $28.7 billion of international revenues subject to translation effects) and evolving legal and regulatory environments affecting compliance costs and operational flexibility. The shift indicates a move from primarily internal performance-linked revenue drivers to greater exposure to and concern over external market and geopolitical pressures.",

We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, extended producer responsibility, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices (including human rights), machine learning and artificial intelligence (including generative artificial intelligence), personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital ex penditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater discharge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola disclosed a detailed revenue recognition policy under ASC 606, emphasizing that revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to customers, with variable consideration estimated based on factors like customer sales volumes, selling prices, and discount rates. These estimates were included in net operating revenues and were reviewed for probable reversals. In 2024, the company highlighted risks around variable consideration, noting that if price increases failed to offset cost increases or if estimates of variable consideration were inaccurate, it could negatively impact financial results. This reflects a shift from a focus on methodology to a focus on risk exposure related to revenue assumptions.",

Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety and sustainability) to acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we ex pect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, or experience adverse events, our business could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other ex ternal business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

      "answer": "In 2022, net operating revenues were a core performance metric for executive compensation through performance share unit (PSU) awards, specifically for grants from 2015\u20132017 (paired with economic profit) and from 2018\u20132021 (paired with earnings per share and free cash flow). These awards tied compensation to achieving predefined revenue targets over multi-year performance periods. By 2024, while net operating revenues remained a key performance indicator, the filing highlights several risks that could hinder revenue growth, including the inability to offset rising costs through pricing or productivity, integration challenges with acquisitions, and potential labor disruptions that could reduce net operating revenues. This indicates that while revenue remains central to executive incentives, external and operational risks have grown in prominence, potentially complicating the achievement of those targets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Performance-Based Share Unit Awards\n\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were economic profit and net operating revenues over a predefined performance period of three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are approved by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors ('Audit Committee'). The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. These awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.\n\nFor performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2021, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow over a predefined performance period of three years. For purposes of these performance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share and free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Net operating revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow are adjusted for certain items, which are approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units earned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit awards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award's performance criterion is earnings per share, and the award includes a relative TSR modifier. Earnings per share for these purposes is diluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which are approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the two-year performance period.\n\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In the event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of performance share units will be earned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.\n\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\n\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided cash payments. As of December 31, 2021, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,587,000, 578,000 and 2,021,000 were outstanding for the 2020-2022, 2021-2022 and 2021-2023 performance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts. The following table summarizes information about outstanding nonvested performance share units based on the target award levels:",

In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees.

In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

          "chunk_text": "Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\n\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volumebased incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable consideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.\n\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):\n\n",

If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we ex pect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, or experience adverse events, our business could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other ex ternal business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $5 million in amortization of intangible assets related to the AMESA segment, indicating an ongoing operational presence. However, in 2023, PEP disclosed a $5 million charge related to the AMESA segment under 'COVID-19 charges,' suggesting that the company's exposure had shifted from long-term asset amortization to short-term costs associated with the pandemic.

      "answer": "In 2022, PepsiCo reported $2 million in acquisition and divestiture-related charges for FLNA, as shown in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, FLNA continued to show no activity with $0 reported for both years. This contrasts with other segments like PBNA, which reported $16 million in 2023 compared to $51 million in 2022, indicating a significant reduction in activity. Similarly, Europe saw a shift from $14 million in 2022 to a negative $2 million in 2023, suggesting divestiture or restructuring effects. PepsiCo's FLNA segment thus remained inactive while other segments experienced notable changes in financial involvement.",

        "Step 3: Other segments like PBNA and Europe saw significant changes in charges between 2022 and 2023, indicating active portfolio management, while FLNA remained financially unchanged."

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria disclosed that the wine segment had previously experienced a full impairment of $74 million in goodwill due to slowing growth in the premium wine category and higher inventories. By 2023, the wine segment was no longer a reportable segment, as Altria completed the Ste. Michelle Transaction in October 2021, removing wine from its business portfolio. This marks a complete discontinuation of the wine segment's presence in Altria's financial reporting.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Altria reported a historical impairment of $74 million in goodwill for the wine segment due to market and inventory challenges.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Altria indicated that the wine segment was no longer reportable, citing the Ste. Michelle Transaction in October 2021 as the reason for its removal from the company's business structure.",
        "Step 3: The wine segment transformed from a financially impaired business unit in 2022 to a fully divested and non-reportable segment in 2023, representing a complete discontinuation."

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria excluded NPM Adjustment Items from its adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate forecasts, noting that these items could be significant, unusual, or infrequent, and difficult to predict. The company did not provide a GAAP reconciliation for these exclusions. By 2023, Altria explicitly disclosed the financial impact of NPM Adjustment Items in its operating results, reporting a $29 million impact in Smokeable Products, which was factored into the reconciliation between reported OCI and adjusted OCI. This represents a shift from exclusion to explicit quantification within operating performance metrics.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, NPM Adjustment Items were among several special items excluded from adjusted financial forecasts without quantification or GAAP reconciliation.",

Altria's management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items on its reported diluted EPS or its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding GAAP measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS forecast or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWhile Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP, its management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins, net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related and disposition-related costs, COVID-19 special items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights), certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ('NPM') adjustment disputes under the MSA (such dispute resolutions are referred to as 'NPM Adjustment Items'). Altria's management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria's underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria's adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate.\n\nAltria's management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results, and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to Altria's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled",

By 2023, the carrying value of this trademark had further declined to $312 million, indicating continued concerns about its fair value relative to its carrying amount. The 2023 filing also notes that the fair value of this trademark 'approximates' its carrying value, signaling that the Company remains under ongoing impairment pressure.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.

      "answer": "In 2022, Colgate reduced advertising investment by 100 basis points as a percentage of net sales, contributing to a 5% increase in operating profit in Europe to $682 million, with operating margin improving 30 basis points to 24.0%. In contrast, in 2023, Colgate increased advertising investment by 180 basis points, which was a key factor in the 160 basis point increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses. This rise in SG&A expenses offset gains from gross profit, resulting in operating profit remaining flat at 20.2% of net sales despite higher pricing and cost savings. Thus, the shift from reduced to increased advertising investment coincided with a reversal in operating margin improvement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, advertising investment decreased by 100 basis points, contributing to lower SG&A and higher operating margin (24.0%) and profit ($682M).",

Organic sales in Europe decreased 0.5% in 2021. Organic sales declines were driven by the Filorga duty-free business and Germany, partially offset by organic sales growth in Poland.\n\nThe decrease in organic sales in Europe in 2021 versus 2020 was due to decreases in Personal Care and Home Care organic sales, partially offset by an increase in Oral Care organic sales. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap, body wash, skin health and bar soap categories. The decrease in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the bleach and hand dish categories, partially offset by organic sales growth in the fabric softener category. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, prescription dental and manual toothbrush categories.\n\nOperating profit in Europe increased 5% in 2021 to $682, or 30 bps to 24.0% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (110 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Gross profit (100 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (330 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-thegrowth initiatives (220 bps). This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was largely due to decreased advertising investment (100 bps).",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company reported a non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin of 22.3%, influenced by the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which had a positive impact of 0.1% in 2023 but 0% in 2022. By 2023, the margin slightly declined to 20.7%, despite ongoing cost initiatives under the Global Productivity Initiative, which contributed 0.1% to the margin. This indicates that while cost management efforts continued into 2023, other factors such as product recall costs and the absence of prior-year impairments offset the benefits, leading to a modest decline in profitability. This evolution suggests a transition in strategic focus from efficiency-driven margin expansion to a more balanced approach amid operational challenges.",

The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

Fiscal 2025 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.4 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to lapping debt issuances in the prior fiscal year and increased share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests in the prior fiscal year and higher short-term borrowings. Fiscal 2024 net cash used in financing activities decreased $3.6 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to fewer share repurchases, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stoc k\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, we received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary and completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, bringing our ownership to approximately 100% of both Massmart and Alert Innovation. The Alert Innovation entity was subsequently sold and deconsolidated in fiscal 2025.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nWe generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.
