      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil presented Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) without specifying its classification relative to GAAP standards. However, in 2024, the company explicitly labeled ROCE as a Non-GAAP measure in its disclosures. Additionally, the formatting of the term changed, with 'ExxonMobil' being inconsistently rendered in the 2024 document as 'Ex x onMobil' in certain sections, indicating a change in how the metric is internally standardized and presented.",

By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments.

Asset  valuation  analysis,  profitability  reviews  and  other  periodic  control  processes  assist  the  Corporation  in assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.\n\nBecause the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets  are  predominantly  based  on  long-term  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices,  industry  margins,  and  development  and production  costs.  Significant  reductions  in  the  Corporation's  view  of  oil  or  natural  gas  commodity  prices  or  margin  ranges, especially  the  longer-term  prices  and  margins,  and  changes  in  the  development  plans,  including  decisions  to  defer,  reduce,  or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals.  On  the  supply  side,  industry  production  from  mature  fields  is  declining.  This  is  being  offset  by  investments  to generate  production  from  new  discoveries,  field  developments  and  technology,  and  efficiency  advancements.  OPEC  investment activities  and  production  policies  also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general economic activities, alternative energy sources and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry  margins  will  experience  significant  volatility,  and  consequently  these  assets  will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn  the  Upstream,  the  standardized  measure  of  discounted  cash  flows  included  in  the  Supplemental  Information  on  Oil  and  Gas Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.",

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life, taking obsolescence into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.\n\nTo the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the ex pected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.\n\nInvestments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEnergy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the  assumptions  supporting  the  Corporate  Plan  is  the  Energy  Outlook,  which  contains  the  Corporation's  demand  and  supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on assumptions which are developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses  to  evaluate  investment  opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation's  assumptions  of  future  capital allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes, development  and  operating  costs  including  greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  V olumes  are based  on  projected  field  and  facility  production  profiles,  throughput,  or  sales.  Management's  estimate  of  upstream  production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions that countries or localities may take in support of Paris Accord pledges. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.\n\nFair value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry  experts  and  government  agencies,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs  and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.\n\nOther  Impairments  Related  to  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment. Unproved  properties  are  assessed  periodically  to  determine whether  they  have  been  impaired.  Significant  unproved  properties  are  assessed  for  impairment  individually,  and  valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.\n\nLong-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about  the  recovery  of  costs  applicable  to  any  interest  retained  nor  any  substantial  obligation  for  future  performance  by  the Corporation.\n\nInterest  costs  incurred  to  finance  expenditures  during  the  construction  phase  of  multiyear  projects  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.\n\n## Environmental Liabilities\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly  sells  into  the  U.S.  dollar  export  market.  Upstream  operations  which  are  relatively  self-contained  and  integrated within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.\n\nFor  all  operations,  gains  or  losses  from  remeasuring  foreign  currency  transactions  into  the  functional  currency  are  included  in income.",

In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach.

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil used flowing production metrics as part of its impairment assessment process, incorporating greenhouse gas emission prices that reflected existing or anticipated policy actions in support of Paris Accord pledges. By 2023, the company had expanded this consideration to include estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, specifically targeting net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin. This indicates a more targeted and forward-looking integration of environmental goals into the impairment evaluation framework.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the Corporation used flowing production metrics in impairment assessments and incorporated greenhouse gas emission prices based on existing or anticipated policy actions supporting the Paris Accord.",

        "Step 3: The evolution from general policy-based greenhouse gas pricing to specific internal emission-reduction cost planning represents a transformation in how flowing production metrics are applied within impairment assessments."

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEnergy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the  assumptions  supporting  the  Corporate  Plan  is  the  Energy  Outlook,  which  contains  the  Corporation's  demand  and  supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on assumptions which are developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses  to  evaluate  investment  opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation's  assumptions  of  future  capital allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes, development  and  operating  costs  including  greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  V olumes  are based  on  projected  field  and  facility  production  profiles,  throughput,  or  sales.  Management's  estimate  of  upstream  production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions that countries or localities may take in support of Paris Accord pledges. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.\n\nFair value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry  experts  and  government  agencies,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs  and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.\n\nOther  Impairments  Related  to  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment. Unproved  properties  are  assessed  periodically  to  determine whether  they  have  been  impaired.  Significant  unproved  properties  are  assessed  for  impairment  individually,  and  valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.\n\nLong-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about  the  recovery  of  costs  applicable  to  any  interest  retained  nor  any  substantial  obligation  for  future  performance  by  the Corporation.\n\nInterest  costs  incurred  to  finance  expenditures  during  the  construction  phase  of  multiyear  projects  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.\n\n## Environmental Liabilities\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly  sells  into  the  U.S.  dollar  export  market.  Upstream  operations  which  are  relatively  self-contained  and  integrated within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.\n\nFor  all  operations,  gains  or  losses  from  remeasuring  foreign  currency  transactions  into  the  functional  currency  are  included  in income.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the consolidated upstream PP&E net balance was $157.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, with a depletion expense of $16.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2023, the consolidated upstream PP&E net balance decreased to $148.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, with a slightly lower depletion expense of $16.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. This indicates a reduction in both the asset base and the depletion expense over the two-year period, reflecting changes in reserve volumes, asset management strategies, or production dynamics.",

The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  consolidated financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matter  below,  providing  a  separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nThe Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation's consolidated upstream property, plant and  equipment  (PP&amp;E),  net  balance  was  $157.0  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021,  and  the  related  depreciation  and  depletion expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $16.7 billion. Management uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration  and  production  activities.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property  (whether  unproved  or proved) are capitalized when incurred. As disclosed by management, proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis  to  calculate  unit-of-production  depreciation  rates  for  most  upstream  assets.  The  estimation  of  proved  oil  and  natural  gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors. As further disclosed by management, reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience  and  engineering  professionals,  assisted  by  the  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  Group  (together  'management's specialists').\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on upstream PP&amp;E, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management's specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, as the reserve volumes are based on engineering assumptions and methods, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes and the assumptions applied to the data related to future development costs and production costs, as applicable.\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  in  connection  with  forming  our  overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to management's  estimates  of  proved  oil  and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  The  work  of  management's  specialists  was  used  in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists' qualifications were understood and the Corporation's relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists' findings. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and  accuracy  of  the  data  related  to  future  development  costs  and  production  costs.  Additionally,  these  procedures  included evaluating whether the assumptions applied to the data related to future development costs and production costs were reasonable considering the past performance of the Corporation.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nFebruary 23, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1934.",

Similarly, emission-reduction roadmaps are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress and policy support, and also represent forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including future energy demand and mix; financial and operating performance; realized price and margins; dividends and shareholder  returns,  including  the  timing  and  amounts  of  share  repurchases;  volume  growth;  project  plans,  timing,  costs,  and capacities;  capital  expenditures,  including  lower-emissions  and  environmental  expenditures;  cost  reductions  and  structural  cost savings; integration benefits; emission intensity and absolute emissions reductions; achievement of ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net-zero from operated assets by 2050, to reduce methane emissions and flaring, or to complete major asset emission reduction  roadmaps;  implementation  and  outcomes  of  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects  and  infrastructure,  renewable  fuel projects,  blue  hydrogen  projects,  and  other  technology  efforts;  the  impact  of  new  technologies  on  society  and  industry;  capital expenditures  and  mix;  investment  returns;  accounting  and  financial  reporting  effects  resulting  from  market  or  regulatory developments and ExxonMobil's responsive actions, including potential impairment charges; and the outcome of litigation and tax contingencies,  could  differ  materially  due  to  a  number  of  factors.  These  include  global  or  regional  changes  in  the  supply  and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials; policy and consumer support for lower-emission products and technologies in different jurisdictions; the impact of company actions to protect the health and safety of employees, vendors, customers, and communities; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the severity, length and ultimate impact of COVID-19 variants and government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance; the outcome  of  exploration  projects  and  timely  completion  of  development  and  construction  projects;  regulatory  actions  targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; changes in local, national, or international law, taxes, regulation or policies affecting our business, including environmental regulations and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade agreements and patterns, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the pace of regional and global economic recovery from  the  pandemic  and  the  occurrence  and  severity  of  future  outbreaks;  opportunities  for  and  regulatory  approval  of  potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to  maintain  near-term  cost  reductions  as  ongoing  efficiencies  while  maintaining  future  competitive  positioning;  unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's treatment or disclosure of future dismantlement costs within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of its dependency on pricing assumptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company discloses future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure and notes the variability caused by using first-day-of-the-month prices.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company again includes dismantlement costs but adds language indicating that the standardized measure 'depends on' pricing assumptions, showing a more explicit linkage.",
        "Step 3: The change from a general disclosure to a dependency relationship indicates a more nuanced or emphasized treatment of how pricing affects dismantlement cost projections."

The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation's expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-themonth average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change.\n\n",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' treatment and reporting of Production and Operating Expenses evolve between the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, particularly with respect to operational drivers and tax-related components as disclosed in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips reported a $687 million increase in Production and Operating Expenses, attributing it to increased well work activities and higher production volumes, particularly in the Lower 48 segment. This reflects an operational focus on volume and activity-driven cost increases. In contrast, the 2024 filing shifted the focus of reporting by including production and operating expenses in the context of tax-related accounting policies, specifically noting that penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in this expense category. This evolution indicates a shift in disclosure emphasis from operational cost drivers to the tax-policy-related components embedded within the same financial metric, suggesting a broader contextualization of expenses in regulatory and compliance frameworks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the 2023 state - In 2023, Production and Operating Expenses increased by $687 million, primarily due to higher well work activities and production volumes in the Lower 48 segment.",
        "Step 2: Identify the 2024 state - In 2024, the company's disclosures included production and operating expenses in the context of tax-related accounting, specifically noting that penalties from unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in this line item.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change - The company's reporting evolved from focusing on operational drivers of expense changes in 2023 to incorporating tax-policy-related elements into the same metric in 2024, indicating a broader disclosure approach."

          "chunk_text": "- Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities -Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\n- Guarantees -The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the l i a bi l i ty when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.\n- Share-Based Compensation -We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.\n- Income Taxes -Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.\n- Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities -Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.\n- Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock -Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock (including fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been i s s ued as common stock) and participating securities. ConocoPhillips grants Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under its share-based compensation programs, the majority of which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the company's common stock. See Note 15 . These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not i ncluded as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted net loss per share does not assume conversion or exelrcise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. See Note 22 .",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP capitalized appraisal drilling costs as part of its successful efforts method of accounting, suspending exploratory well costs on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Block SB405 was described as an 'operated exploration block acquired in 2021' with no mention of plans to relinquish or pause exploration. By 2024, the company had completed a 3D seismic survey (acquired in 2022) and processed the data, but in the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and relinquished the block. This indicates a strategic decision to exit the block after initial evaluation yielded insufficient promise.",

KBBC was previously operated by a joint operating company, Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company, and in January 2025, we became the sole operator of KBBC. There was no change to working interest as part of ConocoPhillips becoming sole operator.\n\n## KBB\n\nGas is transported from the KBB platform via pipeline for sale to the domestic gas market. Since 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating LNG vessel, which provided additional gas offtake capacity.\n\n## Block G\n\n## Malikai\n\nWe own a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. Malikai Phase 2 development first oil was achieved in February 2021. Malikai operates on a tension leg platform and pipes oil to the KBB platform for processing. Oil evacuation is via pipeline to SOGT for tanker liftings.\n\n## Siakap North-Petai\n\nWe own a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil field. First oil from SNP Phase 2 was achieved in November 2021. The subsea system in the SNP oil field is tied back to a FPSO operated by PTTEP.\n\n## Exploration\n\nWe operate three exploration PSCs with 85 percent working interest in Block SK304, 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00 and 35 percent working interest i n the Ubah Cluster. Off the coast of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia, Block SK304 encompasses 1.8 million net acres and Block WL4-00 encompasses 0.3 million net acres. Off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia near the KBBC, the Ubah Cluster encompasses 11 thousand net acres. We continue to evaluate these blocks and are using information from seismic and prior well results to help optimize future plans.\n\nIn 2021, we were awarded operatorship and an 85 percent working interest in Block SB405 encompassing 1.2 million net acres off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation work was completed in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for SB405 PSC and relinquished the block.\n\n## Other International\n\nThe Other International segment includes interests in Colombia as well as contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries.\n\n## Colombia\n\nWe have an 80 percent working interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3 extending over approximately 67,000 net acres. In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 Block, which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. The contracts for this project are currently in force majeure due to the lack of a defined environmental licensing required for the execution of unconventional exploratory activities. Additionally, the government of Colombia supports a ban on such activities.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nFor discussion of our contingencies in Venezuela, see Note 10 .\n\n## 13 ConocoPhillips   2024 10-K",

In contrast, in 2024, the 'Identified Items' had a net positive impact of $79 million on total earnings, with a $34 million negative contribution from the U.S. and a $113 million positive contribution from Non-U.S. operations.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",

The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\n\nAdvantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\n\n- Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects) . Includes Permian (heritage Permian and Pioneer), Guyana and LNG. (1)\n- Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\n- High-Value Products. Includes  performance  products  and  lower-emission  fuels.  Performance  products  (performance  chemicals,  performance  lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant  additional  value  to  customers  and  end-users. Lower-emission  fuels  refers  to  fuels  with  lower  life  cycle  emissions  than  conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\n\nBase Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\n\nStructural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on the next page, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the volume/mix driver.\n\nExpenses. Represents all ex penses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\n\nTiming Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted focus from quantitative values to a more qualitative discussion around impairment risks and dependencies on uncertain assumptions. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes.

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,  given  the  broad  range  of  the  company's  PP&amp;E  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron reported an ARO reduction of $1.3 billion, whereas in 2024, this figure decreased significantly to an ARO reduction of only $0.3 billion. This indicates a notable slowdown in the rate at which the company was reducing its asset retirement obligations, suggesting either an increase in new obligations or a strategic decision to defer certain retirement activities.",

Please refer to 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 23 through 27 for further discussion of GHG regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron's business, including the risks impacting Chevron's strategy, aspirations, targets and disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance matters.\n\n2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; enabling policies and other actions by governing authorities, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits; successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and naturebased solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments; market conditions; and the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits.\n\n2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam) and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include:\n\n- Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- Methane intensity of 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets zero routine flaring by 2030 as outlined in the World Bank's 'Zero Routine Flaring by 2030' initiative.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 2\n\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company's 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines.\n\nSince 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company's effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Tax es to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

      "question": "How has Chevron's approach to lower-carbon capital spending evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of investment focus and progress toward its 2028 targets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron stated it had increased its planned capital spend to approximately $10 billion through 2028 for lower-carbon initiatives, with $2 billion allocated to reducing the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion for investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2023, Chevron had already spent $6.5 billion on lower-carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022. This indicates significant progress toward its 2028 target and suggests an acceleration in implementation, particularly in scaling lower-carbon business lines such as renewable fuels.",

          "chunk_text": "Chevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions  to  help  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  need  for  energy  that  supports  society. Chevron  integrates  climate  change-related  issues  and  the  regulatory  and  other  responses  to  these  issues  into  its  strategy  and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated  laws  and  regulations  and  amount  of  additional  investments  in  new  or  existing  technology  or  facilities,  such  as  carbon capture  and  storage,  is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and  is  expected  to  vary  depending  on  the  actual  laws  and  regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company's activities in it, and market conditions. As discussed in more detail below, the company has announced planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments.\n\nAlthough the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences. Chevron aims to  grow  its  traditional  oil  and  gas  business,  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  and  grow  lower  carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company's traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.\n\nIn 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:\n\n2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple  stakeholders,  continuing  progress  on  commercially  viable  technology,  government  policy,  successful  negotiations  for carbon  capture  and  storage  and  nature-based  projects,  availability  of  cost-effective,  verifiable  offsets  in  the  global  market,  and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n\n2028  Upstream  Production  GHG  Intensity  Targets These  metrics  include  Scope  1,  direct  emissions,  and  Scope  2,  indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:\n\n- 40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oilequivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- 26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- 53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- 66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company's progress toward its net zero aspiration.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's Upstream and  Downstream  business  and  includes  Scope  1  (direct  emissions),  Scope  2  (indirect  emissions  from  imported  electricity  and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016.\n\nPlanned  Lower-Carbon  Capital  Spend  through  2028 The  company  increased  its  planned  capital  spend  to  approximately  $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company",

By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure framework by including Properties, Plant and Equipment in a detailed table of notes to the financial statements, listing it at page 88. This represents a shift from a general reference to a more structured and accessible disclosure format. The change indicates a more transparent and organized approach to presenting asset-related information in the 2023 filing.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Chevron only mentioned Properties, Plant and Equipment in the context of segmentation, directing readers to Note 18 for details.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nAs a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\n\nImpacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevron's financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic  and  the  disruption  to  capital  markets  have  been  and  continue  to  be  far  reaching.  While  the  oil  and  gas industry  witnessed  a  substantial  recovery  of  commodity  prices  and  demand  for  products  during  2021,  there  continues  to  be uncertainty  and  unpredictability  about  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  financial  and  operating  results  in  future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy  and  economic  activity,  including  travel  restrictions  and  prolonged  low  demand  for  our  products;  the  ability  of  our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron's ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.\n\nThe company's suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the company's suppliers could put pressure on the company's financial results  and  may  negatively  impact  supply  assurance  and  supplier  performance.  In-country  conditions,  including  potential  future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently  unable  to  develop  with  any  level  of  confidence  estimates  and  assumptions  that  may  have  a  material  impact  on  the company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  or  operational  performance  in  any  given  period.  In  addition,  the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\n\nIn addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.\n\nChevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company's results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit  ratings,  potentially  increase  financing  costs  and  reduce  access  to  capital  markets. The  company  may  be  unable  to  realize anticipated  cost  savings,  expenditure  reductions  and  asset  sales  that  are  intended  to  compensate  for  such  downturns,  and  such downturns  may  also  slow  the  pace  and  scale  at  which  we  are  able  to  invest  in  new  business  lines  such  as  the  lower  carbon businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies",

This represents a more than threefold increase in dry hole costs year-over-year.

These derivative positions were settled entirely within the first quarter of 2021. See Note 12 .\n\n## Income Statement Analysis\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all results in Income Statement Analysis are before-tax.\n\nSales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes.\n\nEquity in earnings of affiliates increased  $400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment .\n\nGain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 Australia-West divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment.  The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nOther income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5 .\n\nPurchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.\n\nProduction and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.\n\nExploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.  2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska.\n\nImpairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021.  For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13 .\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes.\n\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.\n\nSee Note 17-Income Taxes for information regardin g our income tax provision and effective tax rate.",

changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins;  the  company's  ability  to  realize  anticipated  cost  savings  and  efficiencies  associated  with  enterprise  structural  cost  reduction  initiatives;  actions  of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; changes in projected future cash flows; timing of crude oil liftings; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; pace and scale of the development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company's suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company's joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company's operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company's control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the risk that regulatory approvals and clearances related to the Hess Corporation (Hess) transaction are not obtained or are not obtained in a timely manner or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; potential delays in consummating the Hess transaction, including as a result of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement; risks that such ongoing arbitration is not satisfactorily resolved and the potential transaction fails to be consummated; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction, if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of risks associated with third party contracts containing  material  consent,  anti-assignment,  transfer  or  other  provisions  that  may  be  related  to  the  potential  transaction  that  are  not  waived  or  otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the company's ability to integrate Hess' operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company's future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; changes to the company's capital allocation strategies; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company's ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading 'Risk Factors' on pages 20 through 27 in this report, and as updated in the future.

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily structured through Note 18 in its 10-K filing, focusing on summarizing the accounting policies and financial data related to these assets. By 2024, the company's treatment of impairments became more nuanced, with detailed discussions around the assumptions used in impairment assessments, such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. Chevron also emphasized the impracticality of conducting a sensitivity analysis for impairment reviews due to the large number of assumptions involved and the broad range of assets affected. This represents a shift from a more standardized disclosure to a more strategic and risk-focused narrative around asset valuation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Chevron disclosed Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 18, indicating a standard accounting disclosure format without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity analysis.",
        "In 2024, Chevron's 10-K included a more detailed analysis of impairment triggers, assumptions (e.g., commodity prices, carbon costs), and the impracticality of sensitivity analysis due to the complexity and number of variables involved.",
        "The evolution reflects a shift from a purely accounting-based disclosure to a more strategic and risk-oriented discussion, indicating increased complexity and scrutiny in how Chevron evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment."

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,  given  the  broad  range  of  the  company's  PP&amp;E  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron announced a planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 for lower carbon investments, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion directed toward renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",

          "chunk_text": "Chevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions  to  help  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  need  for  energy  that  supports  society. Chevron  integrates  climate  change-related  issues  and  the  regulatory  and  other  responses  to  these  issues  into  its  strategy  and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated  laws  and  regulations  and  amount  of  additional  investments  in  new  or  existing  technology  or  facilities,  such  as  carbon capture  and  storage,  is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and  is  expected  to  vary  depending  on  the  actual  laws  and  regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company's activities in it, and market conditions. As discussed in more detail below, the company has announced planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments.\n\nAlthough the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences. Chevron aims to  grow  its  traditional  oil  and  gas  business,  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  and  grow  lower  carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company's traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.\n\nIn 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:\n\n2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple  stakeholders,  continuing  progress  on  commercially  viable  technology,  government  policy,  successful  negotiations  for carbon  capture  and  storage  and  nature-based  projects,  availability  of  cost-effective,  verifiable  offsets  in  the  global  market,  and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n\n2028  Upstream  Production  GHG  Intensity  Targets These  metrics  include  Scope  1,  direct  emissions,  and  Scope  2,  indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:\n\n- 40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oilequivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- 26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- 53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- 66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company's progress toward its net zero aspiration.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's Upstream and  Downstream  business  and  includes  Scope  1  (direct  emissions),  Scope  2  (indirect  emissions  from  imported  electricity  and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016.\n\nPlanned  Lower-Carbon  Capital  Spend  through  2028 The  company  increased  its  planned  capital  spend  to  approximately  $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company",

The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; enabling policies and other actions by governing authorities, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits; successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and naturebased solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments; market conditions; and the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits.\n\n2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam) and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include:\n\n- Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- Methane intensity of 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets zero routine flaring by 2030 as outlined in the World Bank's 'Zero Routine Flaring by 2030' initiative.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 2\n\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company's 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines.\n\nSince 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company's effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Tax es to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit was described as having completed the third and final construction season for Greater Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT-2), with drilling operations commencing in the second quarter and first oil achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. By 2023, development activity was noted to have continued, and the Department of the Interior issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on March 12, 2023, approving the Willow project. Additionally, ConocoPhillips announced Final Investment Decision (FID) in December 2023. These developments indicate a shift from construction and initial production in 2022 to regulatory approval and formal project launch in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Greater Prudhoe Area\n\nThe Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields.  Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in North America, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, supported by a large gas and water processing operation. Prudhoe Bay's western satellite fields are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. Field installations include seven production facilities, two gas plants, two seawater plants and a central power station.\n\nIn September 2021, rotary drilling commenced after 18 months of no drilling, resulting in four wells drilled and brought online.  To help offset decline, efforts were focused on increasing rate through well work, capacity enhancements, less downtime, and NGL production.\n\n## Greater Kuparuk Area\n\nWe operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak.  Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of the Prudhoe Bay Field.  Field installations include three central production facilities  which separate oil, natural gas and water,  as well as a seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.\n\nWe operated a coiled-tubi  ng drilling rig in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in five operated wells drilled and brought online.\n\n## Western North Slope\n\nOn the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik.  The Alpine Field is located 34 miles west of the Kuparuk Field.  Field installations include one central production facility which separates oil, natural gas and water.\n\nThe Greater Mooses Tooth Unit is the first unit established entirely within the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR-A).  In 2017, we began construction in the unit with two drill sites: Greater Mooses Tooth  #1 (GMT-1) and Greater Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT-2).  GMT-1 achieved first oil in 2018 and completed drilling in 2019.  In 2021, the third and final construction season for GMT-2 was successfully completed, and drilling operations commenced during the second quarter.  First oil for GMT-2 was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021, as planned.\n\nDuring 2021, we operated a conventional rotary rig and an extended reach drilling rig in the Western North Slope, resulting in seven operated wells drilled and brought online.",
