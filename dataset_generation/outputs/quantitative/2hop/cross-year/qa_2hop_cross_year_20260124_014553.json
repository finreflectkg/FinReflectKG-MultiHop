      "question": "How did the financial impact of the distribution of Veralto Corporation on Danaher's (DHR) accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) change between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the distribution of Veralto Corporation contributed $974 million to Danaher's accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). However, in 2024, this value was fully reversed, with a negative impact of $983 million attributed to the distribution of Veralto Corporation. This indicates a complete reversal of the prior year's adjustment, showing a significant shift in the financial implications of the distribution.",

        "Step 1: Identify the value of the distribution of Veralto Corporation in 2023, which was $974 million added to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).",
        "Step 2: Identify the corresponding value in 2024, which shows a reversal with $983 million subtracted from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change, which reflects a full reversal of the prior year's adjustment, indicating a significant transformation in the financial impact of the Veralto distribution."

By 2024, this distribution no longer had an incremental impact on Accumulated Comprehensive Income, as it was no longer reported as a distinct item.

While no specific quantitative figure was provided for 2024, the framing of the metric changed from growth to decline, signaling a strategic shift in how the company assessed its underlying performance.

The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and div estiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and div estitures can v ary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productiv ity improvements generally refer to improv ed cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a giv en period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a giv en period.\n\n## Sales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company emphasized that reserves for contingent tax liabilities were accrued or adjusted based on comprehensive quarterly reviews of global tax positions, taking into account discussions and resolutions with tax authorities. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in principle but was described in the context of ongoing audits that often result in proposed assessments, with management continuing to accrue or adjust reserves as necessary. However, 2024 introduced a more detailed emphasis on the outcomes of discussions and resolutions with tax authorities influencing these adjustments. This indicates a slight transformation in the disclosure's specificity and focus, though the core practice remained unchanged.",

Interest income of $117 million for 2024 was $186 million lower than in 2023, due to lower av erage cash balances in 2024 primarily as a result of the use of cash for share repurchases and acquisitions.\n\nFor a further description of the Company's debt and cross-currency swap deriv ativ e contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2024 refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\n## General\n\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company's effectiv e tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the v aluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of prev iously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislativ e policy changes that may result from the OECD's initiativ e on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinv ested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to '-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Cash and Cash Requirements' below.\n\nThe amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these rev iews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserv es for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors'.\n\nYear-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Prov ision and Effectiv e Tax Rate\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company derived approximately 60% of its sales from customers outside the U.S., with a strategic focus on penetrating high-growth markets and localizing products. It faced risks such as public health crises, supply chain disruptions, regulatory variability, and political instability, particularly in China, where it generated 13% of its sales. By 2024, while the company continued its international expansion, the emphasis shifted to how global healthcare cost-reduction efforts and pricing pressures, especially in China's volume-based procurement programs, negatively impacted revenues. The nature of the risk evolved from broad operational and geopolitical concerns to more specific market-driven pricing and reimbursement pressures in international segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the company had significant international exposure (60% of sales), with a growth strategy focused on high-growth markets and specific risks in China (13% of sales).",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, the company continued its international presence but faced more specific risks tied to healthcare cost controls and pricing pressures, particularly in China's procurement programs.",

Ev en when we successfully innov ate and dev elop new and enhanced products and serv ices, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceiv ed efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achiev e positiv e clinical outcomes, uncertainty ov er third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market serv ices and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n\nThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e hav e undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:\n\n- Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on gov ernment funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and serv ices and research activ ities. The PPACA, healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and gov ernment austerity measures hav e reduced and may further reduce the amount of gov ernment funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and serv ices and/or the v olume of medical procedures using our products and serv ices. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 ('PAMA') introduced a multi-year pricing program for serv ices payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule ('CLFS') that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by priv ate payors. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect ov erall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing serv ices, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these serv ices is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains v arious drug price negotiation, inflationary rebate and gov ernment-established pricing prov isions with v arying implementation dates and subjects manufacturers who fail to adhere to the gov ernment's interpretation of the law to penalties. The recent change in U.S. administration may also result in changes that unfav orably impact the healthcare industry and our business.\n- Other countries, as well as some priv ate payors, also control the price of healthcare products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or cov erage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of gov ernmental entities) through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protections. For example, China has introduced programs designed to lower prices for medical products and reduce healthcare costs (including a v olume-based procurement program) that hav e unfav orably impacted our rev enues and may continue to adv ersely affect our business and financial statements. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adv ersely impact government funding and reimbursement.\n- Governmental and priv ate healthcare prov iders and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the deliv ery of healthcare serv ices, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of v endors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations, strategic alliances and integrated health deliv ery networks and pursuing consolidation to improv e their purchasing lev erage, using competitiv e bid processes to procure healthcare products and serv ices and inv esting in healthcare practices to increase their control ov er healthcare spending. Payors are also seeking to improv e price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.\n\nThese changes as well as other impacts from market demand, gov ernment regulations, third-party cov erage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is deliv ered, reimbursed and funded and hav e in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serv e to purchase fewer of our products and serv ices, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or serv ices, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding av ailable for our products and serv ices from gov ernmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the v olume of medical procedures that use our products and serv ices, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and ev en if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negativ ely affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described abov e can adv ersely affect our business and financial statements.",

In 2024, the expected contribution for the following year (2025) decreased slightly to $8 million. This $1 million reduction in expected contributions may indicate an improvement in the plan's funded status, suggesting that less cash is required to meet pension obligations due to potentially better-than-expected asset returns or other favorable changes in the plan's financial condition.",

By 2024, the company maintained a similar framework but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'past payment experience' as a core component of its credit risk assessment, suggesting a strategic refinement in prioritizing historical payment behavior in determining creditworthiness.

BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBusiness-Danaher Corporation ('Danaher' or the 'Company') designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, research and industrial products and serv ices, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, innov ativ e technology and major market positions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company operates in three business segments:\n\n- The Biotechnology segment includes the bioprocessing and discov ery and medical businesses and offers a broad range of equipment, consumables and services that are primarily used by customers to adv ance and accelerate the research, dev elopment, manufacture and deliv ery of biological medicines. The Company's solutions support a broad range of biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, replacement therapies such as insulin and v accines, as well as nov el cell, gene, mRNA and other nucleic acid therapies.\n- The Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments, consumables, serv ices and software that are primarily used by customers to study the basic building blocks of life, including DNA and RNA, nucleic acid, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs, v accines and gene editing technologies. Additionally, the segment prov ides products and consumables used to filter and remov e contaminants from a v ariety of liquids and gases in many end-market applications.\n- The Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, consumables, software and serv ices that hospitals, physicians' offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.\n\nRefer to Notes 2 and 3 for a discussion of acquisitions and discontinued operations, including the disposal of the Company's former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment.\n\nAccounting Principles-The accompanying financial statements hav e been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP'). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated upon consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the impact of noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests do not hav e a significant impact on the Company's consolidated results of continuing operations; therefore earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for continuing operations are not presented separately in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests hav e been reflected in selling, general and administrativ e expenses and were insignificant in all periods presented. Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts hav e been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates-The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, the current economic env ironment and on various other assumptions that are believ ed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Howev er, uncertainties associated with these estimates exist and actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\n\nCash and Equivalents-The Company considers all highly liquid inv estments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equiv alents.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts-All trade accounts, contract and finance receiv ables are reported on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management's best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the Company's trade accounts, contract and finance receiv able portfolios. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and sev erity of credit losses that could materially affect the prov ision for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings. The Company regularly performs detailed rev iews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and ev aluates the collectability of receiv ables based on a combination of v arious financial and qualitativ e factors that may affect customers' ability to pay, including customers' financial condition, collateral, debt-serv icing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserv e is recorded against amounts due to reduce the recognized receiv able to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings and amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances. If any prev iously-written off amounts are subsequently recov ered, the amounts will increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserv es would be required. The Company does not believ e that trade accounts receiv able represents significant concentrations of credit risk because",

      "question": "How did the financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's (DHR) comprehensive income evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the long-term financial implications of the distribution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) \u2014 The Veralto Distribution provided $2.6 billion in cash, which was partially used to redeem debt.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 The distribution contributed $974 million to Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) as part of the distribution adjustment line item.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change reflects a shift from immediate liquidity generation in 2023 to a structural balance sheet impact in 2024, indicating ongoing capital reallocation."

However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance\u2014implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Danaher Corporation reported pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments of -$401 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting a net liability. In contrast, by the end of 2024, the company reported a positive adjustment of $101 million for the same category. This shift from a significant negative adjustment to a positive one indicates a substantial improvement or change in the funded status of the company's pension and postretirement plans over the year. The change could reflect improved market conditions, changes in actuarial assumptions, or active management of pension liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - The pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments stood at -$401 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a liability.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - The adjustment for 2024 was $101 million, showing a reversal from a liability to a positive balance.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change from -$401 million to +$101 million represents a transformation in the company's pension obligations, suggesting a significant improvement in the funded status of these plans."

Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash flow hedge adjustments reflect the gains or losses on the deriv ativ e contract designated as the hedging instrument. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments relate to unrecognized prior serv ice credits and actuarial gains and losses. Refer to Notes 14, 15 and 18 for additional information.\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation-The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee serv ices receiv ed in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units ('RSUs') and performance stock units ('PSUs'), based on the fair v alue of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis ov er the requisite serv ice period of the award, except that in the case of RSUs, compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on the stock-based compensation plans in which certain employees of the Company participate.\n\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans-The Company measures its pension and postretirement plans' assets and its obligations that determine the respectiv e plan's funded status as of the end of the Company's fiscal year, and recognizes an asset for a plan's ov erfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and reported in comprehensiv e income (loss). Refer to Note 15 for additional information on the Company's pension and postretirement plans including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, the Company's policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and the method used to estimate serv ice and interest cost components.\n\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted-In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Ow n Equity. The ASU includes amendments to the guidance on conv ertible instruments and the deriv ativ e scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and simplifies the accounting for conv ertible instruments which include beneficial conv ersion features or cash conv ersion features by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20. Additionally, the ASU requires entities to use the 'if-conv erted' method when calculating diluted earnings per common share for conv ertible instruments. On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted the ASU, and the ASU did not hav e a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn Nov ember 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. These required disclosures include information on the nature of transactions and related accounting policies used to account for transactions, detail on the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions including commitments and contingencies. The Company prospectively adopted the ASU effectiv e January 1, 2022 and applied the disclosure guidance to all transactions within the scope of the ASU that were reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into subsequent to the date of initial application. The Company accounts for the gov ernment assistance transactions by analogy to the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance .\n\nThe Company receives various forms of gov ernment assistance, primarily through grants related to the dev elopment of new products and the expansion of production capacity. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. gov ernment, including the Biomedical Adv anced Research and Dev elopment Authority ('BARDA') within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company's Biotechnology businesses and the dev elopment of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company's Diagnostics businesses. The Company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. gov ernment has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid ov er periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded amounts related to these grants and other government assistance that offset operating expenses of $43 million, $51 million and $49 million, respectiv ely, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $198 million, $136 million and $87 million, respectiv ely. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds prov ided by gov ernments are recorded net of gov ernment assistance.",

In 2024, the company lowered its expected contribution for the following year (2025) to $8 million for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, while still citing underlying asset returns as a key factor influencing the final contribution amounts. This represents a $1 million decrease in expected contributions, suggesting a slight improvement or adjustment in pension funding expectations over time.",

During 2025, the Company's cash contribution requirements for its other postretirement benefit plans are expected to be approximately $13 million. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contributions, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.\n\nThe following sets forth benefit payments, which reflect expected future serv ice, as appropriate, expected to be paid by the plans in the periods indicated ($ in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that a 1% difference between estimated and actual medical costs payable (excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance) would have impacted 2021 net earnings by approximately $184 million. In 2023, the company no longer provided a specific dollar impact for a 1% sensitivity change in medical costs payable, instead focusing on the estimation process and actuarial models used to determine medical costs payable. This represents a shift in disclosure focus from quantitative sensitivity to qualitative explanation of estimation methodology.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, the company quantified the impact of a 1% change in medical costs payable as $184 million on 2021 net earnings.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, the company provided detailed descriptions of the actuarial models and estimation process for medical costs payable but did not include a specific dollar impact for a similar sensitivity analysis.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The company shifted from providing a quantitative sensitivity disclosure in 2022 to a more qualitative explanation of estimation methodologies in 2023 without quantifying the financial impact of estimation changes."

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group provided a detailed sensitivity analysis indicating that a hypothetical 1% difference in the estimate of medical costs payable as of December 31, 2021, would have impacted 2021 net earnings by approximately $184 million. This demonstrated a clear quantification of estimation risk. In 2023, the company's disclosure shifted; while Medical Costs Payable remained a distinct section (Note 7) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, no such sensitivity analysis or quantified financial impact was included, suggesting a less transparent approach to estimation risk for this liability.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, UNH disclosed a specific financial sensitivity: a 1% variance in medical costs payable would have impacted net earnings by $184 million.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, UNH disclosed $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and indicated that medical costs payable would be met through cash flows from operations and existing liquidity.",

        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a more static view of liquidity and obligations in 2022 to a more nuanced and risk-aware estimation process in 2023, particularly regarding medical costs payable."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company referenced its cash and investment balances but did not provide specific details on the methodology or precision of its medical costs payable estimates. In contrast, by 2023, the company detailed a more refined and actuarially driven process for estimating medical costs payable, including the use of consistently applied, centrally controlled, and automated actuarial models that consider factors like time from service to claim processing, seasonal variances, contract rate changes, and membership volume. This indicates a shift toward a more systematic and data-driven approach to liability estimation over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company mentioned medical costs payable as part of its cash requirements but did not specify the estimation methodology.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company introduced a detailed, actuarial process for estimating medical costs payable, including specific factors like time from service to claim processing and seasonal variances.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a general mention to a structured, automated, and factor-based actuarial model represents a transformation in the company's approach to estimating liabilities."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported an ending balance of $24,483 million for Medical Costs Payable. However, in 2023, the company no longer provided a detailed table showing the ending balance of Medical Costs Payable, instead only mentioning amortization expense and briefly referencing the components of the change in Medical Costs Payable without specific figures. This shift in disclosure indicates a reduction in transparency around the ending liability position, making it difficult to directly compare or assess the evolution of Medical Costs Payable from 2022 to 2023.",

        "Step 1: Identify the specific ending balance of Medical Costs Payable in 2022, which was $24,483 million as reported in the detailed table.",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change in disclosure and conclude that the lack of specific figures in 2023 prevents a direct comparison of the liability trend, indicating a strategic shift in how the company reports this financial metric."

      "answer": "In 2022, premium revenues from risk-based products comprised nearly 80% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues, indicating a strong dependence on these arrangements. By 2023, the company continued to emphasize risk-based arrangements, particularly through its Optum Health business, where value-based agreements were explicitly recognized as part of premium revenues. This demonstrates a sustained and potentially deepening strategic focus on risk-based models, as the company expanded the inclusion of value-based arrangements in its premium revenue reporting, signaling a transformation in how it structures and accounts for these relationships.",

In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. The future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. We may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. Similarly, state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement (such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing).We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition, our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ, resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities. Our non-clinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some of our customers having to temporarily or permanently close or severely curtail their operations, and unfavorable economic conditions resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact our clients, customers, health care providers, third party vendors and federal and state entities and programs. Among other impacts, we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, which may adversely affect our ability to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations.\n\nFurther disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic's disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business negotiates value-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues. Under a typical arrangement, Optum Health receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer's premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## UnitedHealth Group\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain valuebased arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for the individuals enrolled. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted that medical costs payable were a key short-term cash requirement, with expectations to meet these obligations primarily through operating cash flows and available liquidity. However, in 2023, the company quantified the sensitivity of Medical Costs Payable to changes in utilization and cost trends, showing that a 3% change in these factors would result in a $1,128 million impact on Medical Costs Payable. This reflects a shift from a general liquidity outlook in 2022 to a more quantified risk exposure in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the company listed medical costs payable as a key cash requirement but did not quantify sensitivity to cost trends or utilization changes.",

Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

      "answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $29.056 billion at the end of 2022 to $32.395 billion at the end of 2023. In 2022, the company reported $210.842 billion in total medical costs, with $206.577 billion paid out during the year, leaving a smaller increase in payable liabilities. In contrast, 2023 saw $241.894 billion in total medical costs and $238.556 billion in payments, indicating a larger buildup of unpaid liabilities compared to the prior year. This suggests that UNH's liability for medical costs grew more significantly in 2023, reflecting either higher incurred costs or a strategic shift in payment timing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmodels consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Judgments related to these factors contemplated the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nThe Company's cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company's transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments.\n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security's amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company's investment policy.\n\n## Assets Under Management\n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company's agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company's general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company's discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.",

By the end of 2023, the company remained compliant with its debt covenant that caps the ratio at 60%, though the exact ratio was not disclosed.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor the Company's Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through the Company's home delivery, specialty and community pharmacies. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue and cost of products sold for retail pharmacy co-payments related to its Optum Rx business. Revenue recognized in prior periods related to retail pharmacy transactions excludes the member's applicable co-payment. There was no impact on earnings from operations, net earnings, earnings per share or total equity. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors' members and accordingly, are reported on a gross basis.\n\nServices revenue are comprised of a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health's service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees' dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees' dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, accounts receivables related to products and services were $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, is not material.\n\nSee Note 13 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\n\n## Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\n\nThe Company's estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2021.\n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated.

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable and their sensitivity to estimation errors evolve from 2022 to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported medical costs payable of $24,483 million as of December 31, 2021, reflecting the liability for unpaid claims. By 2023, while the specific dollar amount of medical costs payable is not directly stated, the sensitivity analysis indicated that a 1% difference in the estimate would impact 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This suggests that the company's exposure to estimation risk increased, even if the medical costs payable figure itself grew moderately in line with the sensitivity metric. The shift indicates a growing financial sensitivity to the accuracy of medical cost payable estimates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company disclosed a concrete value of $24,483 million for medical costs payable as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company did not restate the dollar value of medical costs payable directly but introduced a sensitivity analysis showing a $245 million earnings impact for a 1% estimation variance.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows an increase in the financial sensitivity of medical costs payable estimates, indicating a more pronounced risk profile around this liability despite moderate quantitative growth."

In 2023, the company explicitly quantified the sensitivity of Medical Costs Payable, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference in estimates would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This evolution shows a shift from mere disclosure to a more detailed, quantitative risk assessment of Medical Costs Payable, indicating increased scrutiny or transparency around claim liability estimation.",

By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage. The change reflects a minor contraction in this specific product line, even as the company maintained its overall presence in senior insurance offerings.",

UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement offerings include care management and health system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients, including AARP, the nation's largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement's major product categories include:\n\nMedicare Advantage. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, PrivateFee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. Medicare Advantage plans are designed to compete at the local level, taking into account consumer and care provider preferences, competitor offerings, our quality and cost initiatives, our historical financial results and the long-term payment rate outlook for each geographic area. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement served 6.5 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement's senior-focused care management model operates at a medical cost level below traditional Medicare, while helping seniors live healthier lives. We have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed more than 2.1 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2021 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. Our Navigate4Me program provides a single point of contact and a direct line of support for individuals as they go through their health care experiences. For high-risk patients in certain care settings and programs, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement uses proprietary, automated medical record software and digital therapeutics for remote monitoring enabling clinical care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters, creating a comprehensive set of care information bridging capabilities across home, hospital and nursing home care settings. Proprietary predictive modeling tools help identify people at high risk and enable care managers to create individualized care plans to help them obtain the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nMedicare Part D. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people's needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. Each of the plans includes the majority of the drugs covered by Medicare and provides varying levels of coverage to meet the diverse needs of Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.5 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.7 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nMedicare Supplement. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement is currently serving 4.4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program.\n\nPremium revenues from CMS represented 36% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement.\n\n## UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State's primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2021, UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State participated in programs in 32 states and the District of Columbia, and served 7.7 million people; including nearly 1.4 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 18 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## UnitedHealth Group\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain valuebased arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for the individuals enrolled. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements.\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company's obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2021 the Company's IBNR balance was $17 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of claim levels, processing cycles, and consideration of COVID-19.\n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process.",

In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.\n\nShare Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 45 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements.and Supplementary Data.'\n\nDividends. In June 2021, the Company's Board of Directors increased the Company's quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements.and Supplementary Data.'\n\nPending Acquisitions. In 2021, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2022, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $12 billion.\n\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\n\n## Medical Costs Payable\n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period.\n\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion, $880 million and $580 million, respectively.\n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\n\nCompletion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable at the end of the period was $24,483 million, reflecting an increase from $21,872 million at the end of 2021. In contrast, the 2023 filing specifically highlights the disclosure of medical costs payable as a distinct note (Note 7) in the consolidated financial statements, indicating a more transparent and detailed reporting approach for that year. This evolution suggests that while the company's medical costs payable increased in dollar terms in 2022, it shifted toward enhanced disclosure and categorization of these obligations in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the medical costs payable at the end of the period was $24,483 million, showing an increase from the previous year.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects both a quantitative increase in obligations in 2022 and a qualitative shift toward more detailed and transparent reporting in 2023."

Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million.\n\nFinancing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and \u20ac750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes.

Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of \u20ac700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021.\n\nFinancing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020.\n\nThe company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in openmarket or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\n",

AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. (1)\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\n\n## Segments\n\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms \"AbbVie\" or \"the company\" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to i nnovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics). The acquisition complements AbbVie's neuroscience portfolio, adding a wide range of potentially best-in-class assets that may transform standards of care across psychiatric and neurological disorders where significant unmet needs remain for patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's then President and Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, retired from the role of CEO and became Executive Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the board of directors of AbbVie unanimously elected Mr. Michael to succeed Mr. Gonzalez as Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2025, at which time Mr. Gonzalez will retire from the board.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.\n\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and i ndependent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 55,000 employees.\n\n## 33 | 2024 Form 10-K",

The company emphasized its comprehensive product portfolio and innovation in developing therapies for serious diseases. By 2024, AbbVie maintained aesthetics as a core part of its portfolio but demonstrated a shift toward more direct engagement with healthcare providers for aesthetic product distribution and expanded through strategic acquisitions like ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, which, while primarily impacting oncology and neuroscience, reflect a broader strategy of enhancing its therapeutic leadership, including aesthetics.

On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\n\n## Segments\n\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms \"AbbVie\" or \"the company\" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" This section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## Company Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has l eadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to i nnovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics). The acquisition complements AbbVie's neuroscience portfolio, adding a wide range of potentially best-in-class assets that may transform standards of care across psychiatric and neurological disorders where significant unmet needs remain for patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's then President and Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, retired from the role of CEO and became Executive Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the board of directors of AbbVie unanimously elected Mr. Michael to succeed Mr. Gonzalez as Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2025, at which time Mr. Gonzalez will retire from the board.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.\n\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and i ndependent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 55,000 employees.\n\n## 33 | 2024 Form 10-K",

By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, with a 41% drop in the U.S. due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023, and a 13% decline internationally due to continued biosimilar impact.

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline.\n\n## Risks Related to AbbVie's Business\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie's employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\n\n## The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nAbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.\n\nAs patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.\n\nAbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations,\" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018.",

          "chunk_text": "\nOperating cash flows in 2024 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of working capital and higher contingent consideration payments classified as operating cash flows, partially offset by increased results from operations driven by higher net revenues. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie's contributions to its defined benefit plans of $326 million in 2024 and $366 million in 2023.\n\nInvesting cash flows in 2024 included $18.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics offset by cash acquired of $952 million, net sales and maturities of investment securities of $482 million, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $974 million. Investing cash flows in 2023 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.2 billion, capital expenditures of $777 million and net purchases of investments securities totaling $22 million.\n\nFinancing cash flows in 2024 included the issuance of unsecured senior notes totaling $15.0 billion aggregate principal which were used to finance the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. Additionally, financing cash flows included the issuance and repayment of $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement and repayments of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60% senior notes, \u20ac1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.38% senior euro notes, \u20ac700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% senior euro notes, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes, $99 million of secured term notes assumed from ImmunoGen in conjunction with the acquisition and settlement of $400 million aggregate amount of 2.5% convertible senior notes assumed from Cerevel Therapeutics. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the company refinanced its $2.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $2.0 billion term loan due May 2025 and borrowed $2.0 billion under a new term loan due April 2027.\n\nFinancing cash flows in 2023 included repayment of $1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.85% senior notes and $350 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.80% senior notes. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023 the company also repaid \u20ac500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% senior euro notes and $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes at maturity.\n\nFinancing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $11.0 billion in 2024 and $10.5 billion in 2023. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate.\n\nThe company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management's discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 7 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2024 and 10 million shares for $1.6 billion in 2023. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization.\n\nDuring 2024, the company issued and redeemed $7.7 billion of commercial paper. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, AbbVie issued commercial paper borrowings of which $3.3 billion were outstanding as of date of filing of this Annual Report\n\n## 43 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, Other Aesthetics Sales showed strong growth, increasing by 93.0% year-over-year, driven by both U.S. ($1,268M from $666M) and international markets ($198M from $94M). By 2024, the growth pattern had changed significantly, with total Other Aesthetics Sales growing by only 3.7% year-over-year. Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change). This indicates a substantial slowdown in growth momentum for the segment, shifting from rapid expansion to near-stable performance.",

By 2024, the amount for 'Other Expense, Net' had risen significantly to $3,240 million from $2,448 million in 2022.

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",

      "question": "How did the growth trajectory of Rinvoq sales evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of total revenue and the contribution from international markets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Rinvoq generated total sales of $1,651 million, with $1,271 million from the United States and $380 million from international markets, representing growth of over 100% compared to the previous year. By 2024, Rinvoq's total sales had increased to $5,971 million, with $4,259 million from the United States and $1,712 million from international markets, showing a 50.4% growth compared to 2023. This indicates that while Rinvoq continued to grow strongly through 2024, the growth rate had moderated from the explosive increases seen in 2022. The international contribution also expanded significantly, rising from $380 million in 2022 to $1,712 million in 2024, reflecting a broader geographic adoption of the product.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Rinvoq had total sales of $1,651 million, with $380 million from international markets, showing over 100% growth.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - Rinvoq had total sales of $5,971 million, with $1,712 million from international markets, showing 50.4% growth compared to 2023.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - Growth trajectory shifted from explosive year-over-year increases in 2022 to strong but more moderate growth by 2024, with significant international expansion."

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) \u2014 AbbVie had $750 million in interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021, which were used to convert floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 The interest rate swap contracts matured in November 2022 and were not replaced, indicating no active cash flow hedging for floating-rate obligations by 2024.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The company's use of these hedges was discontinued, signaling a shift in its interest rate risk management strategy for floating-rate debt."

These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designed as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.\n\nThe company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $8.6 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of \u20ac5.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and \u20ac6.6 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling \u20ac4.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and \u20ac971 million at December 31, 2020. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\n\nNo amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.\n\n75 | 2021 Form 10-K",

These contracts had notional amounts totaling $5.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of \u20ac3.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and \u20ac5.4 billion December 31, 2023. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling \u20ac6.2 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD500 million and CHF50 million at December 31, 2024 and \u20ac4.9 billion, SEK1.4 billion, CAD750 million and CHF50 million at December 31, 2023. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\n\nNo amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.",

      "question": "How did the growth trajectory of Humira's international sales evolve between 2021 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its market position in the face of biosimilar competition?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Humira's international revenues decreased by 13% due to direct biosimilar competition. By 2024, the international sales decline had moderated to a 17.5% decrease at actual currency rates compared to 2023, indicating that while biosimilar pressure persisted, the rate of decline had somewhat stabilized over time.",

        "Step 1: In 2021, Humira's international revenues decreased by 13% primarily due to biosimilar competition.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the international revenue decline was 17.5% at actual currency rates compared to 2023, showing continued pressure but a more moderate rate of decline.",
        "Step 3: The change from a 13% decline in 2021 to a 17.5% decline in 2024 indicates that while biosimilar competition remained a challenge, the pace of revenue erosion slowed, suggesting some stabilization in its international market position."

In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.\n\nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year.\n\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $5.1 billion, and it was influenced by higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time, and lower discount rates. In 2024, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $3.8 billion, reflecting higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. This indicates that while Skyrizi sales continued to positively influence the fair value change in 2024, the impact of higher discount rates began to constrain the overall increase compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the fair value change of $5.1 billion was driven by stronger Skyrizi sales and market share uptake, along with lower discount rates.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the fair value change decreased to $3.8 billion, still influenced by higher Skyrizi sales but partially offset by higher discount rates.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows that while Skyrizi sales continued to grow and positively impact the contingent consideration liabilities, the effect of higher discount rates in 2024 reduced the overall magnitude of the change compared to 2023."

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt issued to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions.\n\nInterest income in 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and the impact of higher interest rates.\n\nOther expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $3.8 billion in 2024 and $5.1 billion in 2023. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2023, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time and lower discount rates.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nThe effective income tax rate was (15%) in 2024, 22% in 2023 and 12% in 2022. The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law and business development activities. The effective income tax rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations with lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, the U.S. global minimum tax, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, tax audits and settlements, tax credits and incentives in the United States, Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective income tax rate in 2024 was lower than prior periods due to the resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to multiple prior tax years, including the closing of U.S. IRS examinations covering three tax years, partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to prior years. The lower effective i ncome tax rate in 2024 also reflects an increase due to acquisition costs related to certain business development activities and a decrease related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than prior periods due to increased changes in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible asset impairments and the impacts of the transition from the Puerto Rico excise tax to an income tax.\n\nIn 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023.

      "question": "How did the charges related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities for Skyrizi evolve from 2021 to 2024, and what factors contributed to these changes in each respective year?",
      "answer": "In 2021, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities included $2.7 billion in charges, with a significant portion attributed to the Skyrizi liability, driven by higher estimated sales due to stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results, and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. By 2024, the charges increased to $3.8 billion, with the Skyrizi contingent consideration again playing a key role, reflecting higher estimated sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. This indicates a growing liability tied to Skyrizi's performance, despite the offsetting effect of higher discount rates in both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2021, the total charge related to contingent consideration was $2.7 billion, with Skyrizi's liability increasing due to higher estimated sales, clinical trial results, and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the total charge rose to $3.8 billion, with Skyrizi again a major contributor, driven by higher estimated sales and the passage of time, with a similar offset from higher discount rates.",
        "Step 3: The evolution shows a consistent but increasing impact of Skyrizi-related contingent consideration liabilities over time, despite the moderating influence of higher discount rates in both periods."

By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline.\n\n## Risks Related to AbbVie's Business\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition.\n\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie's operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie's employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie's employees, patients, customers and business partners.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\n\n## The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\n\nAbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.\n\nAs patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.\n\nAbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business-Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations,\" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018.",
