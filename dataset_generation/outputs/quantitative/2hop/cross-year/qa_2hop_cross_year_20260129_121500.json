      "question": "How has Goldman Sachs' structure of equity-based compensation agreements evolved from 2023 to 2024, based on the specific forms of award agreements disclosed in each year's filing?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Goldman Sachs disclosed a variety of equity award agreements, including multiple forms of RSU and restricted stock awards such as Form 10.35 (fully vested RSU), Form 10.36 (Base and Supplemental RSU), and Form 10.44 (Performance-Based RSU fully vested). By 2024, these older forms were no longer listed; instead, new structures emerged, such as Form 10.46 (Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership for the Long Term Executive Carried Interest Incentive Program) and Form 10.47 (Subscription Agreement for the same program). This reflects a shift in the structure of equity-based compensation from traditional RSU and restricted stock formats to more partnership-linked long-term incentive arrangements.",

        "Step 1: Identify the forms of equity compensation agreements disclosed in 2023, including traditional RSU and restricted stock agreements such as Forms 10.35, 10.36, and 10.44.",
        "Step 2: Identify the forms of equity compensation agreements disclosed in 2024, noting the absence of the 2023 forms and the addition of partnership-linked long-term incentive forms such as 10.46 and 10.47.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two sets of agreements to assess structural changes, noting the removal of older forms and the introduction of new long-term incentive structures."

By 2024, however, the LTICP was reintroduced with amendments, specifying that future grants could be made under the plan, including grants on or after January 23, 2024, and January 24, 2023. This indicates a strategic shift in the company's compensation structure, reactivating the LTICP for future incentive compensation planning.",

      "question": "How has the regulatory framework governing the relationship between Wells Fargo's Parent company and its subsidiary banks evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm\u2019s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, the Parent's access to funds from subsidiary banks was governed by federal restrictions on covered transactions (10% single affiliate, 20% aggregate) and the 'source of strength' doctrine.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, a new Support Agreement introduced conditional liquidity and capital triggers that restrict the IHC from paying dividends to the Parent, fundamentally altering the capital distribution mechanism.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The regulatory framework shifted from standardized federal banking laws to a more complex, conditional structure involving internal agreements and new restrictions tied to performance metrics."

          "chunk_text": "the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity  and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability to satisfy  its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support A greement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support A greement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.\n\nRecovery Plan . In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank's plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.\n\n## Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions\n\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A  significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent's subsidiaries. V arious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent's subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the Parent's subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Similarly, as part of their supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions. The ability  of the Parent's subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent's subsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under the Support Agreement, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A ny such restriction could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability  to satisfy  its debt and other obligations, as well as its ability  to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock. See the 'Risk Factors' section of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders for additional information on the Support A greement.\n\nIn addition to these restrictions on the ability  of our subsidiary  banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends and share repurchases. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as rules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. banking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated as global systemically important banks (GSIBs). The failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability  to make capital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers. For additional information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, see the 'Capital M anagement' and 'Risk Factors' sections of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. In addition, the FDIC may recover by special assessment on member banks losses to the DIF as a result of resolving a failed bank. For additional information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors hav e engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.",

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's relationship with its subsidiary banks evolved in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Parent's ability to receive dividends from subsidiary banks was restricted by FRB-imposed capital requirements, including Basel III and G-SIB surcharges.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Support Agreement introduced new conditional liquidity mechanisms tied to capital and liquidity metrics, altering the relationship between the Parent and its subsidiary banks.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from general regulatory restrictions to a structured, conditional liquidity support framework indicates a transformation in the Parent's dependency on and control over subsidiary banks."

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's approach to capital distributions evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of regulatory constraints and internal liquidity mechanisms?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo emphasized the Federal Reserve's requirement for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit annual capital plans, including planned capital distributions such as dividends, and compliance with Basel III capital requirements, leverage ratios, and capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Failure to meet these could limit capital distributions. By 2024, the company introduced a new internal liquidity mechanism through the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), which imposed restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if bankruptcy proceedings are authorized. This indicates a shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations on capital distributions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Wells Fargo was subject to FRB-mandated capital planning and Basel III requirements that could restrict capital distributions if not met.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company implemented the Support Agreement with the IHC, introducing internal liquidity triggers that could restrict dividend payments to the Parent, in addition to maintaining compliance with existing regulatory frameworks.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from 2023 to 2024 reflects a transformation in the nature of capital distribution constraints\u2014from primarily regulatory in 2023 to a hybrid of regulatory and internal liquidity-based triggers in 2024."

          "chunk_text": "the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity  and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability to satisfy  its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support A greement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support A greement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.\n\nRecovery Plan . In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank's plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.\n\n## Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions\n\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A  significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent's subsidiaries. V arious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent's subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the Parent's subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Similarly, as part of their supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions. The ability  of the Parent's subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent's subsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under the Support Agreement, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A ny such restriction could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability  to satisfy  its debt and other obligations, as well as its ability  to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock. See the 'Risk Factors' section of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders for additional information on the Support A greement.\n\nIn addition to these restrictions on the ability  of our subsidiary  banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends and share repurchases. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as rules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. banking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated as global systemically important banks (GSIBs). The failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability  to make capital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers. For additional information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, see the 'Capital M anagement' and 'Risk Factors' sections of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. In addition, the FDIC may recover by special assessment on member banks losses to the DIF as a result of resolving a failed bank. For additional information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors hav e engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.",

Revenue from software licenses was recognized upon granting access rights. By 2024, BlackRock disclosed future revenue expectations tied to unsatisfied performance obligations under Technology Services, indicating a shift toward more structured, forward-looking revenue recognition based on contractual commitments. This evolution reflects a strategic emphasis on long-term service delivery and improved revenue visibility.",

      "answer": "In 2023, BlackRock recognized performance fee revenue of $214 million, which was a decrease from $263 million in 2022, indicating a decline in realized performance-based revenue. By 2024, the company explicitly disclosed that performance fee revenue recognition is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met, and a liability for deferred carried interest is recorded when cash or capital allocations are received prior to meeting those criteria. This evolution shows a more detailed articulation of the timing and conditions under which performance fees are recognized, emphasizing the deferral mechanism and liability treatment, which was not explicitly described in 2023.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, performance fee revenue was recognized at a value of $214 million, showing a decrease from the prior year, but no explicit mention was made about deferral or liability treatment.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company introduced a clear disclosure that performance fee revenue is recognized only after meeting specific criteria and that a liability is recorded if cash or capital allocations are received in advance.",
        "Step 3: The change between years reflects a more transparent and structured approach in 2024 regarding the timing and conditions of performance fee revenue recognition, including the establishment of a liability for deferred carried interest, which was not detailed in 2023."

          "chunk_text": "The Com pany records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to m eeting the revenue recognition criteria. A portion of the deferred carried interest m ay also be paid to certain em ployees. T he ultim ate tim ing of the recognition of perform ance fee revenue and related com pensation expense, if any, is unknown.\n\nTechnology services revenue. The C om pany offers investm ent m anagem ent technology system s, risk m anagem ent services, wealth m anagem ent and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. C lients include banks, insurance com panies, official institutions, pension funds, asset m anagers, retail distributors and other investors. F ees earned for technology services are prim arily recorded as services are perform ed over tim e and are generally determ ined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform , or on a fixed-rate basis. R evenue derived from  the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nDistribution Fees. The C om pany earns distribution and service fees related to distributing investm ent products and shareholder support services for investm ent portfolios. D istribution fees are passed-through to third-party distributors, which perform  various fund distribution services and shareholder servicing of certain funds on the C om pany's behalf, and are recognized as distribution and servicing costs. T he C om pany presents distribution fees and related distribution and servicing costs incurred on a gross basis.\n\nDistribution fees prim arily consist of ongoing distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and upfront sales com m issions for serving as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for certain m anaged m utual funds. T he service of distribution is satisfied at the point in tim e when an investor m akes an investm ent in a share class of the m anaged m utual funds. F ees are generally considered variable consideration because they are based on the value of AU M  and are uncertain on trade date. Accordingly, the C om pany recognizes distribution fees when the am ounts becom e known and the portion recognized in the current period m ay relate to distribution services perform ed in prior periods. U pfront sales com m issions are recognized on a trade date basis. Shareholder servicing fees are based on AU M  and recognized in revenue as the services are perform ed.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue. Advisory and other revenue prim arily includes fees earned for advisory services, fees earned for transition m anagem ent services prim arily com prised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of custom ers, and equity m ethod investm ent earnings related to certain strategic investm ents.\n\nAdvisory services fees are determ ined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over tim e as the related services are com pleted.\n\nCommissions related to transition m anagem ent services are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nStock-based Compensation . T he C om pany recognizes com pensation cost for equity classified awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. T he com pensation cost is recognized over the period during which an em ployee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.\n\nThe Com pany generally m easures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ('R SU s') using the C om pany's stock price on the date of grant. T he grant-date fair value related to the October 2024 incentive retention R SU s granted in connection with the G IP  T ransaction, are reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the vesting period discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate, given that they are not entitled to participate in dividends until they vest (See N ote 3, Acquisitions and Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation for further inform ation on the G I P  T ransaction). Stock-based awards m ay have perform ance, m arket and/or service conditions. F or em ployee stock options and awards with m arket conditions, the C om pany uses pricing m odels. C om pensation cost for awards containing perform ance conditions is recognized if it is probable that the conditions will be achieved. T he probability of achievem ent is assessed on a quarterly basis. If a stock-based award is m odified after the grant-date, increm ental compensation cost is recognized for an am ount equal to the excess of the fair value of the m odified award over the fair value of the original award im m ediately before the modification. Awards under the C om pany's stock-based com pensation plans vest over various periods. C om pensation cost is recorded by the C om pany on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, m ultiple awards and is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n\nThe Com pany am ortizes the grant-date fair value of stock-based com pensation awards m ade to retirem ent-eligible em ployees over the requisite service period. U pon notification of retirem ent, the C om pany accelerates the unam ortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirem ent notification period.\n\nThe Com pany recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in incom e tax expense on the consolidated statem ents of incom e, which results in volatility of incom e tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the C om pany's stock price. Accordingly, the C om pany recorded a discrete incom e tax benefit of $37 m illion, $41 m illion and $87 m illion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for vested R SU s where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price.\n\nDistribution and Servicing Costs . D istribution and servicing costs include paym ents to third parties, prim arily associated with distribution and servicing of client investm ents in certain BlackR ock products. D istribution and servicing costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nDirect Fund Expense . D irect fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, prim arily consists of third-party non-advisory expense incurred by BlackR ock related to certain investm ent products for the use of certain index tradem arks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund adm inistration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the non-advisory operations of the fund.\n\nLeases . T he C om pany determ ines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. T he C om pany accounts for its office facility leases as operating leases, which m ay include escalation clauses that are based on an index or m arket rate. T he C om pany accounts for lease and non-lease com ponents, including com m on areas m aintenance charges, as a single component for its leases. The C om pany elected the short-term  lease exception for leases with an initial term  of 12 m onths or less. C onsequently, such leases are not recorded on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition. T he C om pany's lease term s include options to extend or term inate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment of $(3) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment was minimal at $(3) million, suggesting relative stability in prior year claims estimation.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same metric worsened to $(28) million, indicating a significant negative development in prior year estimates.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a fivefold increase in magnitude of negative prior year development, suggesting either a deterioration in claims estimation accuracy or unexpected claims developments in older accident years."

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $24 million. By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a reversal or correction in the prior year development. This shift suggests that AIG adjusted its loss reserve estimates downward in 2024, reflecting either improved claims resolution or a change in actuarial assumptions regarding unallocated loss adjustment expenses.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, AIG reported a positive unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $24 million.",

        "Step 3: The change from a positive to a negative value indicates a significant shift in AIG's estimation or adjustment of unallocated loss reserves between the two years."

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $(1) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. By 2024, this figure significantly worsened to $(28) million, showing a substantial negative development. This suggests that AIG experienced greater-than-anticipated loss adjustment expenses in 2024, which could signal challenges in accurately forecasting or managing claims-related costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG reported unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $94 million, indicating a net negative impact on reserves from prior year adjustments. In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $1 million. By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a significant negative adjustment. This shift from a small positive adjustment to a substantial negative one suggests that AIG may have revised its prior estimates downward in 2024, reflecting either improved claims resolution or a reassessment of loss reserves that year.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, AIG's unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development was $1 million, as disclosed in the 2023 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the same metric was reported as -$28 million, showing a notable reversal in direction and magnitude.",
        "Step 3: The change from a minor positive amount to a significant negative one indicates a shift in how AIG assessed or adjusted its prior year loss reserves related to unallocated loss adjustment expenses."

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both asset management fees (from $12,002 million to $13,875 million) and brokerage fees (from $3,561 million to $3,891 million).

By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments.

The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation.

      "answer": "In 2023, BAC reported a negative tax adjustment of approximately $186 million in 2022 and a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, both tied to U.K. enacted corporate income tax rate changes, with corresponding adjustments to U.K. net deferred tax assets. These assets, primarily composed of historical net operating losses (NOLs) from the U.K. broker-dealer entity, were assessed regularly for impairment. By 2024, management concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary for these U.K. NOL carryforwards, citing sufficient estimated future taxable income and the indefinite carryforward period under U.K. law. The Corporation expected realization of these assets over an extended number of years in a U.K. subsidiary. This marks a shift from a reactive adjustment stance in 2023 to a more confident forward-looking realizability assessment in 2024.",

( 2)\n\nManagement concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets related to the U.K. NOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and certain  state  NOL  carryforwards  since  estimated  future  taxable  income  will  be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. Additionally ,  the Corporation has U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs that are expected to be realized in a U.K. subsidiary over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the relevant entity and the indefinite period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change  in  those  estimates  could  lead  management  to  reassess  such  valuation allowance conclusions.\n\nAt  December  3 1,  202 4,  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  had  not  been  provided  on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the Corporation were  to record the associated  deferred tax liability ,  the  amount  would  be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal  or  most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting  standards  that  require  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its  financial  instruments  into  three  levels  based  on  the  established  fair  value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. T ransfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and  liabilities  b ecome  unobservable  or  observable,  respectively ,  in  the  current marketplace, or when previously insignificant unobservable and observable inputs become  significant,  respectively .  For  more  information  regarding  the  fair  value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .  Th e  Corp ora tion  a ccounts  for  certain  financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 2 1 - Fair Value Option .\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe  following  sections  outline  the  valuation  methodologies  for  the  Corporation's assets  and  liabilities.  While  th e  Corporation  believes  its  valuation  meth ods  are appropriate  and  consistent  with  other  market  participants,  the  use  of  different methodologies  or  assumptions  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  certain  financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring  202 4,  there  were  no  significant  changes  to  valuation  approaches  or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\n\nThe  fair  values  of  trad ing  account  assets  and  liabilities  are  primarily  b ased   on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed  transactions.  The  fair  values  of  debt  securities  are  generally  based  on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor  in  th e  d etermination  of  th e  fair  values  of  trad ing  account  assets  and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed  significantly  or  ceased.  Some  of  these  instruments  are  valued  using  a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity  and  prepayment  rates. Principal and  interest cash  flows  are discounted  using  an  observable  discount  rate  for  similar  instruments  with adjustments  that  management  believes  a  market  participant  would  consider  in determining fair value for the specific security . Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach that considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying  assets  are  valued  using  external  pricing  services,  where  available,  or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are  triggered  by  th e  market's  perception  of  cred it  uncertainty  regard ing  a  single company or a specific market sector. In these",

      "answer": "Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume increased from $11,464 billion in 2022 to $12,087 billion in 2024, representing a 5% growth. However, the growth rates for specific segments changed over time. In 2022, the Consumer Credit segment grew by 17% globally, while in 2024, this growth rate slowed to 6%. Similarly, the Commercial segment saw an increase in growth rate, from 29% in 2022 to 12% in 2024 globally. This indicates a moderation in the expansion of Consumer Credit and a sustained but slower growth in Commercial payments volume.",

This indicates a significant moderation in the rate of credit volume growth over the two-year period.",

        "Step 3: The change in growth rate from 25% in 2022 to 6% in 2024 indicates a significant slowdown in the expansion of Visa's Consumer Credit Volume."

      "answer": "In 2022, the recovery through conversion rate adjustment was $135 million for Series B and $6 million for Series C. By 2024, this amount decreased to $19 million for Series B and $11 million for Series C.

      "answer": "In 2023, COF reported total gross unrealized losses of $9,156 million in its investment securities available for sale. In 2024, this figure slightly increased to $9,152 million. Despite the small numerical decrease, the magnitude of the unrealized losses remained largely significant, indicating that the company continued to face substantial market value declines in its investment portfolio over this period.",

        "Step 1: Identify the gross unrealized losses in 2023, which were reported at $9,156 million in the 2023 10-K filing.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change as minor in magnitude but stable in terms of significant unrealized losses, indicating persistent market value pressures."

We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CV As, which may be adjusted due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments ('DVAs') to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality.\n\n## Balance Sheet Presentation\n\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, and their related gains or losses are included in operating activities as changes in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Table 10.1: Derivative Assets and L iabilities at Fair V alue\n\n",

The Company is working to integrate thinkpipes into its ongoing offerings as well as TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal as part of our offering for RIA clients. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nThe Advisor Services segment also includes the Retirement Business Services business unit. Retirement Business Services provides trust, custody, and retirement business services to independent retirement plan advisors and independent recordkeepers. Retirement plan assets are held at Charles Schwab Trust Bank (Trust Bank) or trusteed by a separate, independent trustee. The Company and independent retirement plan providers work together to serve plan sponsors, combining the consulting and administrative expertise of the administrator with our investment, technology, trust, and custodial services. Retirement Business Services also offers the Schwab Personal Choice Retirement Account , a self-directed brokerage offering for retirement plans. \u00ae\n\n## Sources of Net Revenues\n\nSchwab's largest sources of net revenues are net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and bank deposit account fees. These revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank, broker-dealer, and asset management operating subsidiaries, each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are seeking.\n\nNet interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Schwab's primary funding source for interest-earning assets is uninvested client cash balances held on our balance sheet as part of clients' overall relationship with the Company. Schwab's interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of high-quality fixed income securities, margin loans, and bank loans.\n\nThe majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds, proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and fee-based advisory solutions.\n\nTrading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in certain individual equities, options, futures, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs; order flow revenue; and principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab eliminated online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options.\n\nBank deposit account fees are primarily recognized pursuant to the Company's IDA agreement, as well as sweep agreements with other third-party depository institutions. Under these agreements, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions for bank deposit account fees.\n\n## Regulation\n\nAs a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, Schwab is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). We are also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which we operate. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements.\n\n## Holding Company and Bank Regulation\n\nCSC is a savings and loan holding company and is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve. On March 16, 2021, CSC's declaration electing to be treated as a Financial Holding Company (FHC) was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve. In addition to the activities that a savings and loan holding company that has not elected to be treated as an FHC is permitted to conduct, the Company may now also engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity (FHC Activities), including securities underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, various insurance underwriting activities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC's ability to conduct otherwise permissible FHC Activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements, including requirements",

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab reported Bank Deposit Account Fees of $1.409 billion, reflecting the full-year contribution from the TD Ameritrade acquisition and a high average BDA balance of $158.4 billion. By 2024, these fees had decreased to $729 million, indicating a significant drop in revenue from this stream. This decline suggests a strategic shift where Schwab moved more BDA balances onto its own balance sheet to utilize them as a funding source for interest-earning assets, which aligns with the company's capital management strategy mentioned in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Bank Deposit Account Fees were $1.409 billion, with an average BDA balance of $158.4 billion, showing the full-year impact of the TD Ameritrade acquisition.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Bank Deposit Account Fees dropped to $729 million, indicating a significant decrease in revenue from this source.",
        "Step 3: The decrease in fees from 2022 to 2024 reflects a strategic decision to move BDA balances onto Schwab's balance sheet, reducing fee revenue but increasing net interest revenue through investment in interest-earning assets."

This increased trading activity and a higher percentage of derivatives trades drove significant growth in commissions and order flow revenue. Overall, TD Ameritrade contributed $3.3 billion of trading revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\n\nTrading revenue increased by $664 million, or 88%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In addition, the Company saw a significant increase in DATs and higher order flow revenue in 2020, which were partially offset by the Company's October 2019 pricing actions. Order flow revenue increased by $486 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019.\n\n## Bank Deposit Account Fees\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 pursuant to the IDA agreement and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the floating- and fixed-rate reference yields. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate.\n\nBank deposit account fees totaled $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $355 million from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and the period of October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the total average BDA balance was $158.4 billion and $161.3 billion, respectively, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts for both periods.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company transferred $10.6 billion of BDA balances to its balance sheet from the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party banks. Transfers of BDA balances to Schwab's balance sheet result in lower balances upon which bank deposit account fee revenue is earned but provide a source of funding to invest in interest-earning assets to increase net interest revenue. See also Capital Management and Item 8 - Note 15 for discussion of the IDA agreement and the potential to move IDA balances to Schwab's balance sheet.\n\n## Other Revenue\n\nOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $417 million, or 126%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. Other revenue attributable to TD Ameritrade totaled $462 million and $110 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

      "answer": "In 2022, there is no mention of restructuring costs related to Investor Services, indicating that no such costs were incurred or disclosed during that year. However, by 2024, the company disclosed a total of $365 million in restructuring and related costs for the Investor Services segment in 2023, which included $214 million in employee compensation and benefits, $13 million in facility exit costs, and $134 million in other costs. This indicates a significant strategic adjustment or cost-reduction initiative undertaken in the Investor Services segment between 2022 and 2024.",

        "The introduction of substantial restructuring costs in 2024 that were absent in 2022 signals a strategic shift involving cost-cutting, operational restructuring, or downsizing within the Investor Services segment."

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Segment Net Revenues\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade's results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition.\n\nInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services' growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n## Segment Expenses Excluding Interest\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade's results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 - Note 15).\n\nInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services' expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment's client base and greater client base growth from TDA.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nSchwab's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.\n\nOur risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.",

By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",

Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Table 21: Credit Score Distribution\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, the average loans held for investment decreased by $605 million to $252.7 billion, largely due to declines in the credit card portfolio from higher customer payments and the transfer of a $2.6 billion international card partnership portfolio to held for sale. In contrast, by 2023, average loans held for investment increased by $1.0 billion to $92.5 billion, driven by growth across the loan portfolio, including credit cards. This shift indicates a strategic adjustment in Capital One's credit card lending, moving from a period of contraction and portfolio divestiture in 2022 to renewed growth in 2023, suggesting a recalibration of credit risk appetite and market positioning.",

In comparison, we reported net income of $2.7 billion ($5.18 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.5 billion for 2020 and net income of $5.5 billion ($11.05 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $28.6 billion for 2019.\n\nOur  common equity Tier  1  capital  ratio  as  calculated  under  the  Basel  III  Standardized Approach  was  13.1%  and  13.7%  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See 'MD&amp;A-Capital Management' for additional information.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock. We repurchased  approximately  $2.6  billion  of  shares  of  our  common  stock  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  to  complete  this authorization. On January 21, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of shares of our common stock. See 'MD&amp;A-Capital Management-Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases' for additional information.\n\nBelow are additional highlights of our performance in 2021. These highlights are based on a comparison between the results of 2021 and 2020, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our  financial  condition  and  credit  performance  as  of  December  31,  2021  compared  to  December  31,  2020. We  provide  a  more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this 'Executive Summary and Business Outlook.'\n\nDiscussions of our performance in 2019 and comparisons between 2020 and 2019 can be found in 'Part II-Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A')' of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Total Company Performance\n\n- Earnings:\n\nOur net income increased by $9.7 billion to $12.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by:\n\n- higher  net  interest  income  primarily  driven  by  lower  interest  rates  paid  on  interest-bearing  deposits  and  higher average outstanding balances in our auto loan portfolio;\n- higher non-interest income primarily driven by higher net interchange fees due to an increase in purchase volume, partially offset by the absence of a gain on our equity investment in Snowflake Inc.; and\n- lower  provision  resulting  from  allowance  releases  in  2021  due  to  strong  credit  performance  and  an  improved economic outlook, compared to allowance builds in 2020 driven by expectations of economic worsening at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese drivers were partially offset by higher non-interest expense, primarily driven by increased marketing spend.\n\n- Loans Held for Investment :\n- Period-end  loans  held  for  investment  increased  by  $25.7  billion  to  $277.3  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios.\n- Average loans held for investment decreased by $605 million to $252.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven  by  lower  outstanding  balances  in  Credit  Card  due  to  higher  customer  payments  and  the  transfer  of  a  $2.6 billion international card partnership portfolio to held for sale in the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher purchase volume in our credit card loan portfolio as well as growth in our auto loan portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Loan Classification\n\nWe classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management's intent and ability with regard to the loans, which may change over time. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification, whether we elect the fair value option, whether the loans are originated or purchased and whether purchased loans  are  considered  to  have  experienced  a  more-than-insignificant  deterioration  in  credit  quality  since  origination.  The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management's intent at acquisition or origination. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to hold for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Loans Held for Investment\n\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with consolidated securitization transactions are classified as held for investment. Loans classified as held for investment, except for credit card loans, are reported at  their  amortized  cost  basis,  excluding  accrued  interest.  For  these  loans,  we  elect  to  present  accrued  interest  within  interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans classified as held for investment, earned finance charges and fees are included in either loans held for investment (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer).\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing loans on an accrual basis. We defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees. We recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the effective interest method. For credit  card  loans,  loan  origination  fees  and  direct  loan  origination  costs  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  a  12-month period. The amortized cost of loans held for investment is subject to our allowance for credit losses methodology described below under the 'Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment' section of this Note.\n\n## Loans Held for Sale\n\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Multifamily commercial real estate loans originated with the intent to sell to government-sponsored enterprises are accounted for under the fair value option. We elect the fair value option on these loans as part of our management of interest rate risk along with the corresponding forward sale commitments. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred and are reported in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is calculated based on the loan's stated rate of interest and is reported in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nAll  other  loans  classified  as  held  for  sale  are  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value.  Loan  origination  fees,  direct  loan origination costs and any discounts and premiums are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized as part of the total gain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale, then on the transfer date, any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded as a charge-off and any allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses. The loan is then reclassified to held for sale at its amortized cost at the date of the transfer. A valuation allowance is established, if needed, such that the loan held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we report write-downs or recoveries in fair  value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gains or losses on loans held for sale in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income. We calculate the gain or loss on loan sales as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold, net of the fair value of any residual interests retained.",

By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns.

      "answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan's 10-K filing primarily introduced MEV (Macroeconomic Variable) as a defined term within the glossary, with no explicit application or strategic context provided. By 2024, the treatment of MEV evolved significantly, as it became a core component in the estimation of collateral values for mortgage risk modeling. Specifically, in 2024, MEV was applied through MSA-level home price indices, which were used to forecast collateral values for junior lien home equity products. This shift indicates a move from a purely definitional disclosure in 2023 to a functional, risk-modelling role in 2024, particularly in the context of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio calculations.",

T hese MSA-lev el home price indices consist of actual data to the extent av ailable and forecasted data where actual data is not av ailable. As a result, the estimated collateral v alues used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-lev el collateral v alues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.\n\n## Combined LTV ratio\n\nThe LTV ratio considering all av ailable lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.\n\nMacro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present rev enue on a fully taxableequiv alent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believ es this prov ides information to enable inv estors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.\n\nMarkets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses.\n\nMaster netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions gov erned by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the ev ent of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliv er collateral or margin when due).\n\nMBS: Mortgage-backed securities\n\nMD&amp;A: Management's discussion and analysis\n\nMeasurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair v alues at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar inv estment of the same issuer.\n\nMerchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments serv ices. Through Merchant Serv ices, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.\n\nMEV: Macroeconomic variable\n\nMoody's: Moody's Investor Serv ices\n\nMortgage origination channels:\n\nRetail - Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.\n\nCorrespondent - Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.\n\n## Mortgage product types:\n\n## Alt-A\n\nAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv ) a debt-to-income ratio abov e normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not prov ide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\n\n## Option ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that prov ides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect mov ements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cov er interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which conv erts the loan to a v ariable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniv ersary date triggers.\n\n## Prime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptiv e requirements related to income and ov erall debt lev els. New prime mortgage borrowers prov ide full documentation and generally hav e reliable payment histories.\n\n## Subprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv ) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower's",

By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for.

JPMorganChase uses the asset and liability method to prov ide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorganChase's expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A v aluation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.\n\nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm's businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorganChase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for sev eral years. Thus, the Firm's final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.\n\nEffectiv e January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting for Inv estments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance, under the modified retrospectiv e method. Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 14 for additional information.\n\n## Effective tax rate and expense\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effectiv e tax rate.\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n",

      "question": "How did the role of the CCB segment in JPMorgan's derivative risk management activities evolve between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the CCB segment was primarily involved in mortgage-related revenue generation through Home Lending production and net mortgage servicing revenue, with no mention of its involvement in derivative risk management. By 2024, the CCB segment was explicitly listed as being responsible for managing risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) through specified risk management strategies involving derivatives. This marks a clear shift from a purely revenue-generating role to one that includes active risk management using financial instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - CCB's role was focused on mortgage production and servicing revenue, with no mention of derivatives or risk management.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - CCB is explicitly listed as managing risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, and MSRs using derivatives.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The role of CCB evolved from being revenue-focused to including risk management responsibilities using derivatives, indicating a strategic shift in the segment's function."

      "answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",

T hese MSA-lev el home price indices consist of actual data to the extent av ailable and forecasted data where actual data is not av ailable. As a result, the estimated collateral v alues used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-lev el collateral v alues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.\n\n## Combined LTV ratio\n\nThe LTV ratio considering all av ailable lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.\n\nMacro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets.\n\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present rev enue on a fully taxableequiv alent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believ es this prov ides information to enable inv estors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.\n\nMarkets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses.\n\nMaster netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions gov erned by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the ev ent of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliv er collateral or margin when due).\n\nMBS: Mortgage-backed securities\n\nMD&amp;A: Management's discussion and analysis\n\nMeasurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair v alues at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar inv estment of the same issuer.\n\nMerchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments serv ices. Through Merchant Serv ices, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.\n\nMEV: Macroeconomic variable\n\nMoody's: Moody's Investor Serv ices\n\nMortgage origination channels:\n\nRetail - Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.\n\nCorrespondent - Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.\n\n## Mortgage product types:\n\n## Alt-A\n\nAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv ) a debt-to-income ratio abov e normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not prov ide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\n\n## Option ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that prov ides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect mov ements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cov er interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which conv erts the loan to a v ariable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniv ersary date triggers.\n\n## Prime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptiv e requirements related to income and ov erall debt lev els. New prime mortgage borrowers prov ide full documentation and generally hav e reliable payment histories.\n\n## Subprime\n\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv ) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower's",

      "question": "How did JPMorgan Chase's treatment or disclosure of Core Deposit Intangibles evolve between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, particularly regarding the First Republic acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the state of Core Deposit Intangibles disclosure in 2023 \u2014 JPM disclosed a $1.3 billion core deposit intangible from the First Republic acquisition, with details on valuation methodology and future amortization over 7 years.",
        "Step 2: Identify the state of Core Deposit Intangibles disclosure in 2024 \u2014 JPM repeated the $1.3 billion valuation and 7-year amortization but updated the language to reflect that amortization was now in progress, and added a new note about disputed amounts with the FDIC.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The core valuation remained stable, but the amortization language evolved from future to present tense, and new context about FDIC disputes was introduced, indicating an evolution in the financial relationship and disclosures related to the acquisition."

This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

In 2023, PayPal provided a more detailed geographic breakdown of revenues, categorizing transaction revenues by primary geographical markets, although specific dollar amounts or percentages by region were not disclosed in the provided excerpt.

          "chunk_text": "- Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n- Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period,  divided  by  active  accounts  at  the  end  of  the  period.  The  number  of  payment  transactions  per  active account provides management with insight into the average number of times a customer account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period.\n- TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated  with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments  platform,  management  uses  these  metrics  to  gain  insights  into  the  scale  and  strength  of  our  payments  platform,  the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors' evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\n\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically  developed  or  acquired  through  business  combinations. While  the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction  revenues :  Net  transaction  fees  primarily  charged  to  merchants  on  a  transaction  basis  based  on  the  TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable  on  our  payments  platform.  We  earn  additional  fees  from  merchants  and  consumers  on  transactions  where  we perform  currency  conversion,  where  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the  merchant  and consumer  are  in  different  countries),  to  facilitate  the  instant  transfer  of  funds  for  our  customers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account  to  their  debit  card  or  bank  account,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues  from  other  value  added  services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues  from  interest  and  fees  earned  on  our  portfolio  of  loans  receivable,  and  interest  earned  on  certain  assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that impact our revenue.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's treatment and disclosure of foreign currency exchange gains and losses evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly regarding the accounting of foreign currency exchange contracts and their impact on financial statements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, PayPal described its use of foreign exchange contracts to offset exposure on assets and liabilities, with gains/losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and noted the legacy net investment hedge from 2020 with deferred recognition in AOCI.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, PayPal provided a more detailed breakdown of 'Other income (expense), net,' explicitly listing foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement, forward points on net investment hedges, and fair value changes on non-hedging derivatives.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in the depth and specificity of PayPal's disclosure regarding foreign currency exchange gains and losses, shifting from a general explanation of hedging practices to a more granular and structured presentation of how these items affect financial results."

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Visa did not disclose any specific charge related to Lease Consolidation Costs. However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",

During fiscal 2024, basic and diluted earnings per class A common stock was unchanged, as a result of the downward adjustments of the class B-1 and B-2 common stock conversion rates during the period. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, basic earnings per class A common stock was unchanged and increased $0.01, respectiv ely, and diluted earnings per class A common stock was unchanged in both fiscal years, as a result  of  the  downward  adjustments  of  the  class  B-1  common  stock  conv ersion  rate  during  the  periods.

In 2024, the growth rate slowed to 6%, with the volume reaching $2,990 billion from $2,826 billion the previous year.

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, MetLife described administrative adjustments made to Performance Shares due to the 2017 separation of Brighthouse Financial, which included increasing the number of Shares covered by outstanding Performance Shares by an Adjustment Ratio to maintain intrinsic value. By 2024, MetLife provided a detailed methodology for determining the performance factor, which ranged from 0% to 175% based on return on equity and total shareholder return relative to peers, with a cap of 100% if shareholder return was zero or negative. For the 2021\u20132023 performance period, the payout factor was 147.5%. The 2024 filing also introduced the concept of 'Significant Events'\u2014such as accounting changes, business combinations, or regulatory settlements\u2014that the Compensation Committee may exclude from performance calculations, representing a new layer of discretion not mentioned in the 2022 filing.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The methodology evolved from a purely administrative adjustment to a more nuanced, performance-based system with discretion for external impacts."

By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",

The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  amounts  reported  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  For  a  discussion  of  our significant  accounting  policies,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  most  critical  estimates include those used in determining:\n\n- (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n\n(iii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n\n(iv) investment allowance for credit loss ('ACL') and impairments;\n\n(v) estimated  fair  values  of  freestanding  derivatives  and  the  recognition  and  estimated  fair  value  of  embedded  derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n\n(vi) measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n\n(vii) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n\n(viii) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n\n(ix) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Liability for Future Policy Benefits\n\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value  of  future  expected  benefits  to  be  paid,  reduced  by  the  present  value  of  future  expected  premiums.  Such  liabilities  are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions  used  in  the  establishment  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  are  mortality,  morbidity,  policy  lapse,  renewal, retirement,  disability  incidence,  disability  terminations,  investment  returns,  inflation,  expenses  and  other  contingent  events  as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established  on  a  block  of  business  basis.  If  experience  is  less  favorable  than  assumed,  additional  liabilities  may  be  established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nFuture  policy  benefit  liabilities  for  disabled  lives  are  estimated  using  the  present  value  of  benefits  method  and  experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the  effects  of  current  developments,  anticipated  trends  and  risk  management  programs,  reduced  for  anticipated  salvage  and subrogation.\n\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  Liabilities  for  ULSG  and  paid-up  guarantees  are  determined  by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits  ratably  over  the  accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  The  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n\nWe  regularly  review  our  estimates  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  and  compare  them  with  our  actual  experience. Differences  between  actual  experience  and  the  assumptions  used  in  pricing  these  policies  and  guarantees,  as  well  as  in  the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or a period of sustained low market yields, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and/or the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative. Reductions in net income from these factors may in turn harm our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition.\n\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating the sensitivity of our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may not be able to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while certain hedged items may follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges  in  credit  spreads  may  result  in  market  price  volatility  and  cash  flow  variability.  Market  price  volatility  may  result  in  defaults  and  a  lack  of  pricing transparency, and can make valuations of our securities difficult if trading becomes less frequent, which may require us to add to our reserves. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments. The discount rate used to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits includes a component for market credit spreads that does not necessarily align to our investment spreads. Changes in market credit spreads could result in volatility to liabilities for future policy benefits relative to our asset values.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity and life insurance business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity and life products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit ex posure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds, real estate ventures, real estate funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash, which may differ from performance of public equity markets, which drives performance of our equity hedges. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.",

Assessments  are  used i nternally by management to monitor operaEng performance as it allows for comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trends. Assessments  do  not represent our net revenue.\n\nThe following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:\n\n- DomesHc assessments are charges based on acEvity related to cards that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domesEc dollar volume of acEvity (e.g., domesEc purchase volume, domesEc cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n- Cross-border assessments are charges based on acEvity related to cards that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are  different.  These  assessments  are  primarily  driven  by  the  cross-border  dollar  volume  of  acEvity  (e.g.,  cross-border  purchase  volume,  cross-border  cash volume).\n- Transaction processing assessments a re  cha rges  pri ma ri l y dri ve n by the number of s witched tra ns a ctions  on our pa yment network. Switching activities include:\n- Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval\n- Cl e a ri ng, the  determina Eon and exchange of financial transacEon informaEon between issuers and acquirers aVer a transacEon has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction\n- Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\n\nThese  assessments  can  also  include  connecEvity  services  and  network  access,  which  are  based  on  the  volume  of  data  transmiNed  and  the  number  of authorization and settlement messages.\n\n- Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\n\n## 51 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K",

      "question": "How did the presentation and disclosure of Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the level of quantitative detail provided?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MA provided quarterly and annual percentage increases in Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), with an annual increase of 21% reported for the year ended December 31, 2021. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted its disclosure approach, opting to present GDV in a chart format for select programs and solutions without providing the same level of detailed percentage growth metrics or quarterly breakdowns. This represents a move from detailed, time-based quantitative reporting to a more generalized, program-focused presentation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, MA disclosed quarterly and annual GDV growth percentages, including a 21% annual increase.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, MA disclosed GDV in a chart for select programs without detailed growth metrics or quarterly data.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in disclosure strategy from granular quantitative reporting to a more limited, visual format without time-based comparisons."

      "answer": "In 2023, American Express reported $1,433 million in current consumer Card Member Loans and $103 million in 30-89 days past due, with $36 million in 90+ days past due. In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due.

      "answer": "In 2023, consumer Card Member Loans had $103 million in 30-89 days past due balances and $36 million in 90+ days past due balances. Small business loans showed $45 million and $16 million in the same categories. By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively. This indicates a moderate increase in credit risk, suggesting potential deterioration in loan quality or economic pressures affecting repayment capabilities.",

        "Step 1: Identify delinquency figures for consumer and small business Card Member Loans in 2023: $103M (30-89 days) and $36M (90+ days) for consumers; $45M and $16M for small businesses.",
        "Step 2: Identify delinquency figures for the same categories in 2024: $110M (30-89 days) and $45M (90+ days) for consumers; $56M and $22M for small businesses.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: All delinquency categories increased from 2023 to 2024, indicating a moderate rise in credit risk for Card Member Loans."

      "answer": "In 2023, the total restructuring and related costs for Investor Services were $87 million, composed of $66 million in compensation and benefits, $18 million in occupancy and equipment, and minor amounts in professional services and other categories. In 2024, the total costs increased significantly to $365 million, driven primarily by a substantial rise in compensation and benefits to $214 million and a large increase in other costs to $134 million, with facility exit costs also contributing $13 million. This represents a major transformation in both the magnitude and structure of costs.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - Total Investor Services restructuring cost was $87 million, primarily in compensation and occupancy.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change was a transformation in both scale and composition of restructuring costs."

      "answer": "In 2023, MetLife experienced gross margin compression on its universal life insurance products due to interest rate sensitivity, and managed the risk through product design features and asset/liability management (ALM) strategies, including interest rate derivatives. However, lowering crediting rates could be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees. By 2024, MetLife significantly reduced its interest rate risk exposure for universal life products as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving minimal exposure from this block. This represents a major reduction in the risk profile of these products year-over-year.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, MetLife's universal life insurance products were exposed to interest rate risk leading to gross margin compression, which was managed through ALM strategies and derivatives.",

Additionally,  we  ex perience  gross  margin compression  from  our  disability  policy  claim  reserves  for  which  crediting  rates  cannot  be  reduced.  We  use  interest  rate  derivatives  to  mitigate  gross  margin compression for both products.\n\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and the prevailing interest rate assumptions.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario . We reinvest our cash flows from our group insurance products in higher yielding assets, mitigating the impact of (i) higher interest crediting rates on, primarily, our retained asset accounts, and (ii) lower income from our derivative positions used to mitigate low interest rate margin compression.\n\n## Retirement and Income Solutions\n\nThis business contains both short- and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products.\n\nThe two hypothetical interest rate scenarios do not assume any additional ALM actions we may take to preserve margins.\n\nDeclining  Interest  Rate  Scenario .  A  significant  portion  of  short-duration  products  are  managed  on  a  floating  rate  basis,  which  mitigates  gross  margin compression. Our long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2027.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario . Our long-duration products, which have very predictable cash flows, benefit from reinvesting in higher yielding assets, which is partially offset by the negative impact of lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment. A significant portion of our short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis. The negative impact of higher crediting rates on these short-duration products is partially offset by higher income from derivative positions designed to protect against a rising interest rate environment.\n\n## Asia (Japan Only)\n\nDeclining  Interest  Rate  Scenario. Our  Japan  business  offers  traditional  life  insurance  and  accident  &amp;  health  products,  many  of  which  are  U.S.  dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\n\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. For U.S. dollar denominated products, higher reinvestment rates on cash flows from these products more than offset the negative impacts  of  (i)  higher  interest  crediting  rates  on  such  products,  and  (ii)  lower  income  from  derivative  positions  designed  to  protect  against  a  low  interest  rate environment.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nDeclining  Interest  Rate  Scenario. Our  interest  rate  sensitive  life  products  include  traditional  and  universal  life  products.  Since  most  of  our  traditional  life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, our interest rate risk exposure has been substantially reduced as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023 and we have minimal exposure from this block.\n\nOur annuity products can experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. While most of these contracts are either at or slightly above their minimum crediting rate, we use interest rate derivatives to manage the gross margin compression risk.",

This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.

      "answer": "In 2022, Visa explicitly stated that net revenues were positively impacted by growth in processed transactions, along with payments volume and cross-border activity. The filing directly tied revenue changes to transaction metrics. In contrast, the 2023 filing shifted focus toward service revenue recognition based on prior-quarter nominal payments volume and included more granular details on how volume categories (e.g., consumer prepaid, Interlink, and cash volume) fed into reporting. The 2023 disclosure also introduced a lagged relationship between volume and revenue, and provided a more structured breakdown of the components of total nominal volume. This evolution indicates a more detailed and methodical approach to explaining how processed transactions influence revenue over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, processed transactions were directly linked to net revenue growth as a positive driver.",
        "In 2023, the focus shifted to how service revenue is based on prior-quarter nominal payments volume, with more detailed categorization of transaction types.",
        "The change reflects a more structured and transparent disclosure framework in 2023 that clarifies the timing and composition of volume and revenue relationships."

In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. Consumer Debit Volume grew to $2,826 billion, reflecting a 6% increase compared to the previous year.

      "question": "How did Visa's disclosure and treatment of Total Nominal Volume evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of reporting methodology and transparency?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Visa provided detailed quantitative breakdowns of Total Nominal Volume, including specific dollar amounts for consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories across U.S. and international segments, along with percentage changes year-over-year (e.g., Total Nominal Volume was $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021). In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, Visa disclosed detailed Total Nominal Volume figures with comparative data across regions and categories, including year-over-year changes (e.g., $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021).",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2023, Visa referenced Total Nominal Volume in terms of its role in revenue calculation and provided definitions, but did not disclose updated dollar amounts or comparative metrics.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change reflects a shift from quantitative reporting to qualitative explanation, with no updated figures provided in 2023 despite prior detailed disclosures."

      "question": "How did Visa's disclosure of Nominal Payments Volume for consumer debit and commercial segments in 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in its reporting granularity and strategic focus?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Visa reported detailed Nominal Payments Volume figures by segment, including a 26% year-over-year increase in U.S. consumer debit volume and a 9% increase in commercial volume. By 2023, Visa no longer provided the same level of granular breakdown, instead disclosing that service revenue was based on prior-quarter nominal payments volume and noting that volume information might be updated, though not materially. This reflects a shift toward more generalized reporting and a strategic emphasis on linking volume metrics directly to revenue drivers rather than segment-level transparency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Visa provided detailed Nominal Payments Volume data segmented by consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories, showing specific year-over-year percentage changes like 26% growth in U.S. consumer debit volume.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Visa's disclosure shifted focus to the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter volume, without providing updated volume figures by segment, indicating a move away from detailed segment reporting.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a reduced emphasis on segment-level transparency and a more revenue-centric disclosure strategy, suggesting a shift in how Visa communicates the strategic importance of volume metrics."

This  contract  matured  in  2020.  Gains  and  losses  associated  with  this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated.\n\nAdditionally,  in  connection  with  transactions  occurring  in  multiple  currencies  on  our  payments  platform,  we  generally  set  our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when  transactions  occur.  Given  that  we  also  have  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  on  our  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  our  subsidiaries,  we  have  an  additional  foreign  currency  exchange  exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other  income  (expense),  net,  and  are  offset  by  the  gains  and  losses  on  the  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts.  These  foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\n\n## KEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## KEY METRICS\n\nActive  accounts,  number  of  payment  transactions,  number  of  payment  transactions  per  active  account,  and  TPV  are  key  nonfinancial performance metrics ('key metrics') that management uses to measure the performance of our business, and are defined as follows:\n\n- An active  account is  an  account  registered  directly  with  PayPal  or  a  platform  access  partner  that  has  completed  a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third party's login credentials, including entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts, an increase of 2% compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nWe measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including TPV , payment transactions, and active accounts:\n\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nNumber of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAn active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gatewayexclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third-party's login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities.

The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\nOur business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive profitable growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:\n\n- Two-sided platformwe facilitate online and offline transactions for millions of consumers and merchants. Our relationship on both sides of a transaction enables us to offer unique product experiences designed to remove friction, drive sales, and enhance shopping experiences. We utilize the data about how our customers use our platform to continually innovate and improve it.\n- Trusted brandswe have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, V enmo, and Braintree. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers.\n- Open ecosystemwe are technology and platform agnostic. This approach allows our merchants to offer and use a variety of our branded and unbranded payment processing solutions and business financing products, alongside other tools. We give consumers flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of funding options and digital wallet solutions, including their bank account, PayPal and V enmo account balance, buy now, pay later, debit and credit options.\n- Scaleour global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts in approximately 200 markets around the world. 1\n- Risk and compliance managementour enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help keep customer information secure and ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.\n- Regulatory licenseswe believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth.\n\nA market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in w hich w e offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of law s and regulations. 1",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal did not explicitly disclose its cross-border TPV figures, but it emphasized the role of foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposure risks on its payments platform, indicating that cross-border transactions were a material part of its business requiring active financial risk management. By 2024, PayPal explicitly stated that cross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through its Xoom product. Additionally, TPV grew from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, representing a 10% increase. The inclusion of Xoom in the definition of cross-border TPV in 2024 suggests a more integrated approach to international payments compared to 2022, where foreign exchange risk management was discussed in broader terms without specific product linkage.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, PayPal discussed foreign exchange exposure related to cross-border transactions broadly, using foreign currency contracts to manage risk, implying significant cross-border TPV activity but without explicit figures or product linkage.",
        "In 2024, PayPal explicitly defined cross-border TPV and included the Xoom product as a contributor, showing a more structured and integrated approach to international payments.",
        "The evolution from general risk management language in 2022 to a product-specific, quantified disclosure in 2024 indicates a transformation in how PayPal manages and reports on its cross-border TPV activity."

The  number  of  payment  transactions  per  active account provides management with insight into the average number of times a customer account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period.\n- TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated  with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments  platform,  management  uses  these  metrics  to  gain  insights  into  the  scale  and  strength  of  our  payments  platform,  the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors' evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\n\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically  developed  or  acquired  through  business  combinations. While  the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction  revenues :  Net  transaction  fees  primarily  charged  to  merchants  on  a  transaction  basis  based  on  the  TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable  on  our  payments  platform.  We  earn  additional  fees  from  merchants  and  consumers  on  transactions  where  we perform  currency  conversion,  where  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the  merchant  and consumer  are  in  different  countries),  to  facilitate  the  instant  transfer  of  funds  for  our  customers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account  to  their  debit  card  or  bank  account,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues  from  other  value  added  services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues  from  interest  and  fees  earned  on  our  portfolio  of  loans  receivable,  and  interest  earned  on  certain  assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that impact our revenue.",

      "answer": "The fair value of non-agency RMBS decreased from $996 million in 2022 to $690 million in 2024. This indicates a significant reduction in the company's exposure to non-agency RMBS over this period. In 2022, the fair value was $996 million with $205 million in gross unrealized gains and no gross unrealized losses. By 2024, the fair value had declined to $690 million, with $89 million in gross unrealized gains and $5 million in gross unrealized losses. The decline in fair value, coupled with the emergence of unrealized losses, suggests a strategic reduction and potential de-risking from this segment of the portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife emphasized the use of actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, and investment returns to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits, with a focus on establishing these liabilities based on expected future benefits and premiums. The company also noted that unfavorable experience relative to assumptions could result in additional liabilities. By 2023, the focus shifted to how external financial conditions, particularly low interest rates and declining risk asset returns, could negatively impact these liabilities. Specifically, the 2023 filing highlights that declining interest rates may necessitate increases in reserves, including those for future policy benefits, due to lower investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches. This indicates a shift from an internal actuarial focus in 2022 to a more market-risk oriented perspective in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, MetLife described liabilities for future policy benefits as being calculated based on actuarial assumptions like mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns, with liabilities adjusted if actual experience deviated from assumptions.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company highlighted how macroeconomic conditions, especially low interest rates and poor asset returns, could increase liabilities for future policy benefits due to reduced investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in emphasis from internal actuarial modeling (2022) to external financial risk factors (2023) as key drivers of liability volatility."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  amounts  reported  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  For  a  discussion  of  our significant  accounting  policies,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  most  critical  estimates include those used in determining:\n\n- (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n\n(iii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n\n(iv) investment allowance for credit loss ('ACL') and impairments;\n\n(v) estimated  fair  values  of  freestanding  derivatives  and  the  recognition  and  estimated  fair  value  of  embedded  derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n\n(vi) measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n\n(vii) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n\n(viii) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n\n(ix) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Liability for Future Policy Benefits\n\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value  of  future  expected  benefits  to  be  paid,  reduced  by  the  present  value  of  future  expected  premiums.  Such  liabilities  are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions  used  in  the  establishment  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  are  mortality,  morbidity,  policy  lapse,  renewal, retirement,  disability  incidence,  disability  terminations,  investment  returns,  inflation,  expenses  and  other  contingent  events  as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established  on  a  block  of  business  basis.  If  experience  is  less  favorable  than  assumed,  additional  liabilities  may  be  established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nFuture  policy  benefit  liabilities  for  disabled  lives  are  estimated  using  the  present  value  of  benefits  method  and  experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the  effects  of  current  developments,  anticipated  trends  and  risk  management  programs,  reduced  for  anticipated  salvage  and subrogation.\n\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  Liabilities  for  ULSG  and  paid-up  guarantees  are  determined  by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits  ratably  over  the  accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  The  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n\nWe  regularly  review  our  estimates  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  and  compare  them  with  our  actual  experience. Differences  between  actual  experience  and  the  assumptions  used  in  pricing  these  policies  and  guarantees,  as  well  as  in  the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.",

      "answer": "In both 2022 and 2023, MetLife cited low interest rates as increasing the cost of risk transfer measures, which decreases profit margins. However, in 2023, MetLife expanded the context by emphasizing that reductions in net income from these factors could harm credit instrument covenants or the rating agency assessment of their financial condition, a detail not explicitly included in the 2022 filing. This indicates a heightened focus on the downstream implications of low interest rates beyond just cost increases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, MetLife stated that low interest rates increase the cost of risk transfer measures and reduce profit margins, with a focus on reinvestment risks and investment spread compression.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, MetLife reiterated the same cost-increasing effect of low interest rates on risk transfer measures but added new language about the broader financial consequences, such as impacts on credit covenants and rating agency evaluations.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in how MetLife communicates the impact of low interest rates \u2014 maintaining the core relationship but introducing new context around financial condition and covenant risks."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Public Health Risks\n\nPandemics and other public health issues, and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, have affected and may continue to affect economic conditions. They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business  confidence,  behavior  and  activity,  changes  to  interest  rates  and  other  market  risk  factors,  and  governmental  or  other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other  reasons,  losses  incurred  in  our  general  account  and  the  impact  of  guarantees,  including  increases  in  liabilities,  capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\n\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived  returns.  This  may  result  in  cash  outflows  requiring  the  sale  of  investments  on  less  favorable  terms,  resulting  in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ('VOBA'), reducing net income, harming our credit  instrument  covenants  and  rating  agency  assessment  of  our  financial  condition.  Interest  rate  increases  may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity  needs.  Furthermore,  if  interest  rates  rise,  our  unrealized  gains  on  fixed  income  securities  may  decrease  and  our unrealized  losses  may  increase.  We  would  recognize  the  accumulated  change  in  estimated  fair  value  of  these  fixed  income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\n\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may  not  be  able  to  invest  assets  at  the  full  liability  duration,  thereby  creating  some  asset/liability  mismatch.  In  addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Adjusted Earnings Available to Common Shareholders were influenced by foreign currency fluctuations calculated on a constant currency basis using average exchange rates, and the company noted that reconciliations of non-GAAP measures were not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to unpredictable variations in investment and derivative gains or losses. By 2023, foreign currency had a measurable negative impact of $220 million on Adjusted Earnings, primarily affecting the Asia segment, while market factors, such as lower returns on private equity and hedge funds, reduced adjusted earnings by $3.0 billion. This represents a shift from the 2022 explanation, which focused more on definitional and reconciliation challenges rather than quantified impacts.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, the document primarily described the definition and methodology behind Adjusted Earnings Available to Common Shareholders, emphasizing the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis and the difficulty of reconciling non-GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the document provided specific quantitative impacts on Adjusted Earnings Available to Common Shareholders, including a $220 million decrease due to foreign currency and a $3.0 billion decrease from market factors such as investment returns.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift from a definitional and methodological focus in 2022 to a more results-oriented disclosure in 2023, where specific drivers of earnings changes were quantified and analyzed."

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported that approximately 5% of its invested assets each year were subject to reinvestment risk through 2024, primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on long-duration products and guaranteed minimum crediting rates on deferred annuities and retained asset accounts. By 2023, this percentage increased to 6% of invested assets annually, with reinvestment risk extending through 2026. This indicates a slight increase in MetLife's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and a longer duration of reinvestment risk, suggesting a more sustained vulnerability to gross margin compression under a low interest rate environment.",

A significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. Our long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest  rate  derivatives  and  asset/liability  duration  matching  to  mitigate  gross  margin  compression.  These  mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2024.\n\nRising  Interest  Rate  Scenario. Our  long-duration  products  which  have  very  predictable  cash  flows  benefit  from reinvesting  in  higher  yielding  assets,  which  is  partially  offset  by  the  negative  impact  of  lower  income  from  derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment. A significant portion of our short-duration products are  managed  on  a  floating  rate  basis.  The  negative  impact  of  higher  crediting  rates  on  these  short-duration  products  is partially offset by higher income from derivative positions designed to protect against a rising interest rate environment.\n\n## Asia\n\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. Our Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident &amp; health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\n\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. For U.S. dollar denominated products, higher reinvestment rates on cash flows from these products more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates on such products, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nDeclining Interest Rate Scenario. Our interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since  most  of  our  traditional  life  insurance  is  participating,  we  can  mitigate  gross  margin  compression  by  adjusting  the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. Although we are able to mitigate gross margin  compression  by  lowering  interest  crediting  rates  on  certain  in-force  universal  life  policies,  these  actions  may  be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees.\n\nOur annuity products experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these contracts are at their minimum crediting rate, and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate gross margin compression.\n\nOur  long-term  care  business  experiences  gross  margin  compression  as  we  cannot  reduce  interest  crediting  rates  for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory  approval  to  reflect  emerging  experience.  We  review  the  discount  rate  assumptions  and  other  assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\n\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\n\nBased on our investment  portfolios  and  cash  flow  estimates,  approximately  5%  of  our  invested  assets  each  year  are subject to reinvestment risk through 2024.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. Higher reinvestment rates on cash flows, over time, more than offset the negative impacts of (i) higher interest crediting rates, and (ii) lower income from derivative positions designed to protect against a low interest rate environment.",

By 2023, GDV was still disclosed but only appeared in a chart format without a direct explanation of its impact on revenue.

In 2023, the filing no longer provided a specific growth percentage but instead focused on refining the definition and methodology of measuring Switched Transactions, including normalization for switching and carryover days, and noting the impact of data exclusions from sanctioned Russian banks starting in Q1 2022. This shift indicates a move from purely reporting growth to enhancing transparency around measurement practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Switched Transactions grew by 25%, showing strong quantitative reporting of transaction growth.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the focus shifted to the methodology of measuring Switched Transactions, including normalization adjustments and data exclusions from Russia.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a change in disclosure strategy from reporting performance metrics to clarifying how those metrics are measured, particularly in response to operational changes like the exclusion of Russian data."

      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon referenced the 'Information on Stock Ownership' section under 'Additional Information' in the Proxy, which was incorporated by reference into Item 12 of the 10-K filing. By 2024, the company maintained the same structural reference, incorporating the 'Information on Stock Ownership' under the 'Additional Information' section of the Proxy for Item 12. However, there was a noticeable evolution in the formatting and internal presentation of related content, including changes in punctuation (e.g., the use of &amp; instead of 'and') and minor rewording in the description of incorporated sections. While the core information and location within the Proxy remained consistent, the presentation was refined, suggesting a subtle shift in how the company communicates its governance and ownership disclosures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 totaled $1,439 million. In 2023, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident years increased to $2,055 million. This significant rise indicates a lengthening of the claims settlement timeline, suggesting that AIG is taking longer to settle claims, which could imply either more complex claims or a more conservative approach to claims resolution. This also points to potential reserving implications, as the company may have initially underestimated the ultimate payout for these accident years.",

In the 2023 disclosure, cumulative paid losses for accident year 2014 decreased to $439 million and for accident year 2015 decreased to $495 million. This indicates a reduction in the claims payout for these older accident years in the 2023 reporting period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG reported liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance, at $3,850 million. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1,251 million. This represents a significant decline in the company's net loss reserves over the year, indicating a substantial reduction in the estimated future payouts for prior accident years. The change reflects a negative impact on AIG\u2019s reserves, suggesting that the company revised its estimates downward, either due to favorable loss experience or changes in actuarial assumptions.",

      "question": "How has the risk profile of American Express's Discount Revenue evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Discount Revenue was described as American Express\u2019s largest revenue source, primarily earned from transactions at merchants accepting American Express cards, with no specific emphasis on surcharging or airline-related risks. By 2024, the company explicitly noted that surcharging and differential acceptance practices in regions like Australia, Canada, and the EU were materially impacting merchant discount rates and card usage. Additionally, in 2024, the company highlighted a 7% exposure of worldwide billed business to airline merchants, introducing credit risk if airlines fail to deliver services after payments are made. This indicates a shift from viewing Discount Revenue as a stable core income stream to recognizing it as increasingly vulnerable to external pressures such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific credit risks.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n- Expense management products and services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n\nOur various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. We have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). The commercial arrangements with GBT include, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBT uses the American Express brand, GBT's support of certain of our partnerships, joint negotiation with travel suppliers and a strategic relationship between GBT and our GCS business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT was reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT's acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights remain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG). Upon consummation of the business combination, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by APSG's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals, the terms of certain of our commercial arrangements with GBT will be amended and GBT will become a public company.\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., domestic or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for 'non-swiped' card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, service fees earned from merchants, travel commissions and fees, and Membership Rewards program fees; and\n- Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with our GNS partners (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, earnings (losses) from equity method investments (including GBT), insurance premiums, and prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue.",

See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.\n\nSimilarly, we are ex posed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor additional information relating to operational risks of our business partners, see ' We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business ' below.\n\n## We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rates and network and loan volumes.\n\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\n\n## Surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIn certain countries, such as Australia, Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are permitted by law to engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices for certain card purchases and certain merchants and merchant organizations continue to push for these practices in other jurisdictions. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, such as limiting the use of our cards for certain transactions. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nRecently introduced products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other",

Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods.

The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes.

Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\n\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.",

Prior period segment results have been revised to conform with current period presentation.\n\nResults of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below.\n\n## TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE\n\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the GCSG and GCS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment's Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue.\n\nNet card fees and Other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported.\n\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported.

We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor additional information relating to operational risks of our business partners, see ' We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business ' below.\n\n## We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rates and network and loan volumes.\n\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\n\n## Surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIn certain countries, such as Australia, Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are permitted by law to engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices for certain card purchases and certain merchants and merchant organizations continue to push for these practices in other jurisdictions. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, such as limiting the use of our cards for certain transactions. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nRecently introduced products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other",

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business environment, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\n\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.",

This indicates a significant shift in the company's claims management or reserving practices, moving from a net positive development in prior years to a negative adjustment in 2024, suggesting either overestimation of prior loss reserves or a change in claims settlement patterns.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG reported a prior year development of $92 million for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, indicating a net increase in estimated expenses from previous years. However, by 2024, this figure had shifted to a negative $28 million, meaning the company experienced a net reduction in unallocated loss adjustment expenses from prior years. This trend suggests that AIG's loss reserve estimates became more accurate over time, as the company reduced its need for additional expense adjustments. The reversal from a positive to a negative development reflects an improvement in the company's ability to estimate and manage these costs.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, AIG reported a $92 million positive prior year development for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, indicating an upward revision in estimated expenses from prior years.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, AIG reported a -$28 million prior year development for the same metric, indicating a downward revision in prior year estimates.",
        "Step 3: The change from a positive to a negative development over this period indicates an evolution toward more accurate loss reserve management, as the company reduced its need for expense adjustments."

By 2024, this figure had changed to $(28) million, indicating a shift from a positive adjustment to a negative one. This change suggests that AIG revised its prior estimates downward more significantly in 2024 compared to 2022, reflecting a more pronounced need to increase loss reserves based on new information or claims development.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG reported liabilities for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses at $3,570 million for periods before 2012, with a prior year development of $334 million. By 2024, this liability for periods before 2015 had decreased to $919 million, with only $51 million in prior year development. This significant reduction indicates that AIG's earlier loss reserves were potentially overestimated or that the company has improved its claims settlement processes, leading to lower ultimate losses than initially projected. The smaller development in 2024 also suggests greater actuarial precision or more conservative reserving practices compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Card Member Loans were primarily described as a core component of American Express's lending business, directly contributing to net interest income and reflecting the company's lending features such as Pay Over Time and Plan It. These loans were positioned as a stable and integral part of the company's financial model. By 2023, however, the narrative shifted as the company noted increasing risks to Card Member Loans due to external pressures such as heightened competition, the rise of alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, and macroeconomic disruptions including natural disasters affecting key states like Florida and California. These factors were noted to negatively impact credit performance and borrowing trends, signaling a more vulnerable position for this revenue stream compared to the previous year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Card Member Loans were described as a key part of the company's lending business, with structured payment features and a clear role in generating net interest income.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, external pressures such as competition and alternative financing were noted to negatively impact the performance and growth of Card Member Loans.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The role of Card Member Loans shifted from a stable and integral revenue source in 2022 to a more vulnerable asset in 2023 due to external threats and macroeconomic events."

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAverage discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.\n\nBilled business - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' for further related definitions under Basel III.\n\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\n\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\nCobrand cards - Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.\n\nCredit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.\n\nDiscount revenue - Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express disclosed that modifications to Card Member Loans did not reduce the principal balance and that there were no payment term extensions, indicating a stable and consistent internal policy regarding loan modifications. By 2023, external economic pressures such as geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters in key states like California and Florida, and increased competition from alternative financing products began to negatively impact the credit performance and spending behavior of Card Members. These external factors introduced new risks that could affect repayment trends and loan performance, marking a shift from internal policy consistency to external vulnerability.",

As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts, an increase of 2% compared to December 31, 2023.\n\nWe measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers through certain metrics, including TPV , payment transactions, and active accounts:\n\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nNumber of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAn active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gatewayexclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third-party's login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\nOur business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive profitable growth and differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:\n\n- Two-sided platformwe facilitate online and offline transactions for millions of consumers and merchants. Our relationship on both sides of a transaction enables us to offer unique product experiences designed to remove friction, drive sales, and enhance shopping experiences. We utilize the data about how our customers use our platform to continually innovate and improve it.\n- Trusted brandswe have built and strengthened well-recognized and trusted brands, including PayPal, V enmo, and Braintree. Our communications and marketing efforts across multiple geographies and demographic groups play an important role in building brand visibility, usage, and overall preference among customers.\n- Open ecosystemwe are technology and platform agnostic. This approach allows our merchants to offer and use a variety of our branded and unbranded payment processing solutions and business financing products, alongside other tools. We give consumers flexibility to make and receive payments using a wide variety of funding options and digital wallet solutions, including their bank account, PayPal and V enmo account balance, buy now, pay later, debit and credit options.\n- Scaleour global scale helps us to drive organic growth. As of December 31, 2024, we had 434 million active accounts in approximately 200 markets around the world. 1\n- Risk and compliance managementour enterprise risk and compliance management program is designed to help keep customer information secure and ensure we process legitimate transactions around the world, while identifying and minimizing illegal, high-risk, or fraudulent transactions.\n- Regulatory licenseswe believe that our regulatory licenses, which enable us to operate in markets around the world, are a distinct advantage and help support business growth.\n\nA market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction, such as a country, territory, or protectorate, in w hich w e offer some or all of our products and services. A country, territory, or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of law s and regulations. 1",

      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that retail e-commerce sales were among several macroeconomic factors influencing transaction and credit losses, specifically affecting the funding mix and consumer spending behavior. By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process. The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million, with models now explicitly incorporating forecasted retail e-commerce sales sourced externally using a single economic scenario for each period.",

Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Allowance for Consumer Loans Receivable\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for loans and interest receivable was $461 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $341 million relates to consumer loans receivable. The allowance for consumer loans receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario to reflect the economic conditions applicable to a particular period.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses; and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for consumer loans receivable, including controls over certain consumer loss models, and for the revolving credit portfolio, forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales used to estimate expected credit losses. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the allowance for consumer loans receivable; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and consumer loss models used by management and (b) for the revolving credit portfolio, the reasonableness of forecasted macroeconomic factors related to household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 4, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, up from 0.90% in 2022, primarily due to unfavorable product mix changes, especially from unbranded card processing.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Transaction Expense Rate decreased slightly to 0.93%, indicating a small improvement or stabilization following the prior year's increase.",
        "Step 3: The change from 0.94% in 2023 to 0.93% in 2024 represents a minor decrease, suggesting that while the company faced cost pressures in 2023, it experienced slight relief in 2024, possibly through better funding mix or cost management."

      "answer": "In 2022, Short-Term Borrows contributed a net increase of $9 million to interest expense, with a breakdown showing $6 million from average volume and $3 million from average rate. By 2023, the company disclosed a significant increase in the total value of Short-Term Borrows, reporting $32,953 million in total, which included $26,400 million in FHLB borrowings and $6,553 million in other short-term borrowings. This indicates both a quantitative increase and a qualitative shift in the composition of borrowings, with the introduction of detailed categories not previously itemized.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Short-Term Borrows contributed $9 million to interest expense, with volume and rate effects of $6 million and $3 million respectively.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company disclosed a much larger total value of $32,953 million for Short-Term Borrows, with specific categories such as FHLB borrowings ($26,400 million) and other short-term borrowings ($6,553 million).",
        "Step 3: The change reflects both a significant increase in magnitude and a transformation in how the company reports its borrowings, introducing new categories and showing a much larger total exposure."

By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Net interest revenue\n\nNet interest revenue is not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606), because it is generated from financial instruments covered by various other areas of GAAP. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Our primary interest earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans; investment securities; and bank loans. Fees earned and incurred on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by the Company's brokerdealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are also included in interest revenue and expense.\n\n## Asset management and administration fees\n\nThe majority of asset management and administration fees are generated through our proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Mutual fund and ETF service fees are charged for investment management, shareholder, and administration services provided to Schwab Funds and Schwab ETFs , as well as recordkeeping, shareholder, and administration services provided to third-party funds. Advice solutions fees are charged for brokerage and asset management services provided to advice solutions clients. Both mutual fund and ETF service fees and advice solutions fees are earned and recognized over time. Fees are generally based on a percentage of the daily value of assets under management and are collected on a monthly or quarterly basis. \u00ae \u2122\n\n## Trading revenue\n\nTrading revenue is primarily generated through commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, fixed income securities, and certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs, as well as order flow revenue. Commissions revenue is earned when the trades are executed and collected when the trades are settled. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is recognized when the trades are executed and is collected on a monthly or quarterly basis.\n\n## Bank deposit account fees\n\nBank deposit account fees consist of revenues resulting from sweep programs offered to certain clients whereby uninvested client cash is swept off-balance sheet to FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) accounts at the TD Depository Institutions and other thirdparty depository institutions. The Company provides marketing, recordkeeping, and support services related to these sweep programs to the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party depository institutions in exchange for bank deposit account fees. These revenues are based on floating and fixed yields as elected by the Company subject to certain requirements, less interest paid to clients and other applicable fees. Bank deposit account fees are earned and recognized over time and collected on a monthly basis.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Generally, the most significant portion of other revenue is exchange processing fees, which are comprised of fees the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries charge clients to offset the exchange processing fees imposed on us by third-parties. Exchange processing fees are earned and collected when the trade is executed and are recognized gross of amounts remitted to the third-parties, which are included in other expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, OTC derivative trading revenues were directly tied to the fair value measurement of financial instruments, including derivatives related to financial instruments and commodities, and were presented net-by-counterparty. This indicated that counterparty credit quality and the Firm\u2019s own credit risk were integral to the valuation and revenue recognition of these instruments. By 2024, the firm explicitly noted that its credit ratings can 'have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions.' This evolution reflects a more explicit acknowledgment of the role credit ratings play in influencing counterparty confidence and transaction volume in OTC derivatives, rather than just valuation adjustments. The change suggests a growing emphasis on the indirect revenue implications of creditworthiness.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, OTC derivative revenues were tied to fair value measurements, which inherently included credit risk considerations in valuation.",
        "In 2024, the firm explicitly stated that credit ratings influence trading revenues in OTC derivatives due to counterparty performance concerns.",
        "The change indicates a shift from implicit to explicit recognition of credit ratings\u2019 impact on OTC derivative business performance."

For borrow ings w ith put options, maturity represents the earliest put date.\n\nBorrowings  of  $289  billion  at  December  31,  2024  increased  when  compared with  $264  billion  at  December  31,  2023,  primarily  due  to  issuances  net  of maturities and redemptions.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nWe  believe  that  accessing  debt  investors  through  multiple  distribution channels  helps  provide  consistent  access  to  the  unsecured  markets.  In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings  with  original  maturities  greater  than  one  year  are  generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.\n\nThe availability  and  cost  of  financing  to  us  can  vary  depending  on  market conditions,  the  volume  of  certain  trading  and  lending  activities,  our  credit ratings  and  the  overall  availability  of  credit.  We  also  engage  in,  and  may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our marketmaking activities.\n\nFor further information on Borrowings, see Note 13 to the financial statements.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nWe  rely  on  external  sources  to  finance  a  significant  portion  of  our  daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in  those  businesses  where  longer-term  counterparty  performance  is  a  key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions.
