      "question": "How has the composition of equity award agreements disclosed by Goldman Sachs evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what specific types of agreements were added or removed?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Goldman Sachs disclosed multiple forms of equity award agreements, including various types of RSU agreements such as Year-End RSU Award Agreements (both fully and not fully vested), Short-Term RSU Award Agreements, Fixed Allowance RSU Award Agreements, and Performance-Based RSU Award Agreements. By 2024, the firm no longer listed certain Performance-Based RSU agreements and instead introduced new forms related to the Long Term Executive Carried Interest Incentive Program, specifically the Form of Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership and the Form of Subscription Agreement and Materials for Participants in the same program. This reflects a shift in compensation structure emphasizing long-term executive incentives.",

By 2024, the company highlighted that failure to meet regulatory standards such as 'well capitalized' and 'well managed' status could result in limitations on its activities and adversely affect its financial condition, signaling a shift toward a more risk-aware stance. Additionally, in 2024, the company noted that its ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to regulatory constraints, which was not explicitly emphasized in 2022.

Additionally, while Exhibit 21.1 (primary subsidiaries) remained filed herewith in both years, the 2024 filing included Exhibit 19.1 on insider trading policies, a new addition not present in 2022.

In contrast, by 2024, BK not only reaffirmed the existence of primary subsidiaries through Exhibit 21.1 but also elaborated on the operational structure, including the roles of key U.S. banking subsidiaries such as The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, National Association, and their respective business segments. Additionally, BK detailed the international presence of BNY SA/NV, highlighting branches across multiple European cities and its role in Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. This indicates a more comprehensive disclosure and a clearer articulation of the subsidiaries' roles and geographic reach in 2024 compared to 2022.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in the depth and specificity of disclosure regarding primary subsidiaries, particularly in operational focus and international presence, marking a transformation in how the entity relationship is communicated."

At that time, the company reported $2.4 trillion in assets under management. By 2024, BNY had stabilized its segmentation approach, maintaining three principal segments including Investment and Wealth Management, and reported $2.0 trillion in assets under management. This indicates a strategic consolidation rather than expansion, with a slight decrease in assets under management despite overall growth in assets under custody and administration.",

By 2024, the Proxy sections remained largely similar, but the formatting evolved from 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' to 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis,' suggesting a minor refinement in presentation or emphasis.

      "answer": "In 2022, the document highlighted that the Parent company's ability to meet obligations, including shareholder dividends, was dependent on dividends from subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC. It also noted that failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends could limit capital return to shareholders. In 2023, the disclosure evolved to emphasize that the ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the Board's discretion and may be limited by U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and the failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends. The 2023 disclosure added more regulatory and governance context compared to the more operationally-focused 2022 version.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - The Parent's dependence on subsidiaries for capital and the impact of preferred stock dividend failures on shareholder returns were emphasized.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2023) - The disclosure expanded to include regulatory discretion, U.S. banking laws, and Delaware law as limiting factors on capital returns, alongside preferred stock dividend considerations.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The treatment evolved from operational dependency to a broader regulatory and legal framework affecting capital returns, indicating a transformation in how preferred stock dividends are contextualized."

      "answer": "In 2022, BK mentioned climate change as a risk that could adversely affect its business, client activity levels, and reputation. By 2023, the company expanded this risk to include broader ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) concerns, explicitly stating that these issues could not only affect business and client activity but also subject the company to additional regulatory requirements. This evolution reflects a more comprehensive framing of ESG-related risks in BK's financial condition disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, BK specifically identified 'climate change' as a risk affecting business, client activity, and reputation.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, BK broadened the scope to 'ESG concerns, including climate change,' and added new dimensions such as regulatory requirements and expanded impacts on reputation.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation in how ESG factors are framed in the context of financial condition, moving from a narrow climate focus to a broader ESG risk profile."

      "question": "How has the focus of BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of asset management responsibilities and organizational structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment was described as part of a two-segment structure before being disaggregated into Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment and Wealth Management segment remained unchanged during this reorganization. It managed $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the Investment and Wealth Management segment remained one of the three principal business segments, but assets under management decreased to $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023. This indicates a shift in asset management scale, though the segment's structural role within the company remained consistent.",

        "Step 1: Identify the state of the Investment and Wealth Management segment in 2022, including its role and asset under management figures ($2.4 trillion).",

        "Step 3: Analyze the change by comparing the asset management scale and organizational positioning between the two years."

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $46.7 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury\n- Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY Mellon SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and is also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules. BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France.  BNY Mellon SA/NV's activities are in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management.

      "answer": "In 2022, the 10-K filing included standard sections such as Business (Item 1), Risk Factors (Item 1A), and Properties (Item 2), with no dedicated cybersecurity section. By 2023, a new Item 1C was added specifically for Cybersecurity, appearing immediately after Unresolved Staff Comments and before Properties. This indicates that the company has responded to emerging regulatory expectations and strategic concerns around cybersecurity by formally integrating it into its disclosure framework. The addition reflects a proactive alignment with evolving governance and risk management standards, suggesting a growing emphasis on digital risk transparency.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BK noted that its fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by slowing market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance, and negative trends in savings rates or investment preferences. By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize continued dependence on fee-based business for a substantial majority of revenue, with additional specificity that fee-based revenue sensitivity extended to 'slowing market activity' and 'weak financial markets' but also included 'underperformance and/or negative trends in savings rates or in investment preferences.' While the overall exposure remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure refined the characterization of market sensitivity without indicating a material quantitative shift in fee income composition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, BK disclosed that fee-based revenues were vulnerable to slowing market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance, and negative trends in savings or investment preferences.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2023, BK reiterated its dependence on fee-based revenue and maintained similar risk language, but slightly rephrased the factors affecting fee income, preserving the same core risks with minor wording adjustments.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The description of fee-based revenue exposure remained largely consistent across years, with no indication of a quantitative change in fee income magnitude. The evolution was primarily linguistic, not substantive, suggesting stable exposure to the same market-driven risks."

However, there was a notable change in the method of filing related to the consent of auditors: in 2023, the consent was filed under KPMG LLP, while in 2024, it was filed under KPMGLLP. This suggests a possible change in the legal or operational structure of the auditing entity involved, which could indicate an internal restructuring or a shift in service providers.

In 2024, the filing explicitly outlined the roles of The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, National Association, specifying that the former houses Securities Services businesses including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services, and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, while the latter focuses on Wealth Management and certain Pershing business activities.

By 2024, this risk was expanded to include the specific concern that BK 'may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our transition to a platforms operating model,' indicating a more concrete and strategic shift with defined expectations and potential shortfalls. This evolution reflects a deepening risk as the company moves from general transformation initiatives to a specific operating model transformation.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $52.1 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.0 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2024. With its subsidiaries, BNY has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe divide our businesses into three principal business segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, tax credit investments and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bankadvised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses\n\nour Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve'). The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe.

      "question": "How has the expansion of sustainability-related risk disclosures in 2024, specifically the inclusion of diversity alongside climate change, likely influenced BNY Mellon's client engagement strategy compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon cited ESG concerns\u2014specifically climate change\u2014as a risk that could affect client activity levels. By 2024, the company broadened its risk language to include 'sustainability concerns, including a focus on climate change and diversity.' This evolution indicates that BNY Mellon likely expanded its client engagement strategy to incorporate diversity-related initiatives as a material factor influencing client behavior and expectations. The addition of diversity as a risk factor suggests a strategic shift in how the firm anticipates client priorities evolving, requiring more comprehensive ESG integration across products and services to retain and attract clients.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company identified ESG concerns, particularly climate change, as a factor that could affect client activity levels, indicating a focus on environmental aspects of ESG.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the language evolved to include 'sustainability concerns, including a focus on climate change and diversity,' which signals an expanded view of ESG beyond environmental to include social dimensions.",
        "Step 3: The change implies a broader client engagement strategy in 2024 that must now address both climate and diversity issues to align with client expectations, suggesting a strategic evolution in response to changing client activity drivers."

By 2024, while the company continued to highlight the importance of liquidity management, the specific mention of credit loss allowances was absent. Instead, the focus shifted toward broader liquidity risk factors, including regulatory capital requirements and the Parent's reliance on dividends and credit extensions from its subsidiaries.

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $52.1 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.0 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2024. With its subsidiaries, BNY has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe divide our businesses into three principal business segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, tax credit investments and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bankadvised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses\n\nour Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').

      "answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon's forward-looking statements referenced estimates regarding 'capital ratios' in a general sense, primarily in the context of financial condition and risk management processes. By 2024, the disclosures became more strategic, explicitly tying capital ratios to 'capital plans including dividends and repurchases' and broader 'strategic priorities and initiatives' such as the transition to a platforms operating model and efficiency savings. This evolution indicates a shift from general risk-related disclosures to more forward-looking, strategy-driven commentary on capital management.",

In 2024, the disclosure expanded to include limitations imposed by U.S. banking laws, regulatory capital requirements, Delaware law provisions, and the impact of preferred stock dividend delays, indicating a more nuanced and restricted view of its ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends.

This indicates that despite an increase in gross settlement exposure from $75,023 million to $78,385 million, the company applied more risk mitigation arrangements, increasing them from $12,167 million to $13,466 million. However, the net settlement exposure still rose, suggesting that the growth in gross exposure outpaced the additional risk mitigation.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Payment Network Revenue included $15,182 million of rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased by 22% on both an as-reported and currency-neutral basis compared to 2022, primarily due to growth in key drivers and new or renewed deals. In 2024, while the company continued to recognize revenue net of rebates and incentives, the disclosures emphasized a structural clarification that rebates and incentives are attributed directly to the relevant revenue category, with a focus on variable consideration based on transaction volumes. This reflects a shift toward more transparent revenue disaggregation and recognition aligned with contractual performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, rebates and incentives totaled $15,182 million and increased 22% year-over-year, indicating a growing investment in customer incentives tied to network growth.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company clarified that rebates and incentives are now explicitly attributed to the relevant revenue category and recognized net of variable consideration based on transaction volumes.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from merely reporting incentive amounts to explaining how these incentives are integrated into revenue recognition practices, indicating a more structured and transparent approach."

Revenue\n\nMastercard  is  a  payments  network  service  provider  that  generates  revenue  from  a  wide  range  of  payments  soluEons  provided  to  customers. Revenue  from contracts with customers is recognized when services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideraEon to which the Company expects to be enEtled to i n e xcha nge for those services (i.e., fees charged to customers). The Company disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and soluEons. The Company's net revenue categories, payment network and value-added services and soluEons, are recognized net of rebates and incenEves provided to customers. Rebates and incenEves can be either fixed or variable and are aNributed to the category of revenue to which they pertain.\n\n## Payment network\n\nMastercard's payment network involves four parEcipants in addiEon to the Company: account holders (a person or enEty who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders' financial insEtuEons), merchants and acquirers (the merchants' financial insEtuEons). Revenue from the Company's payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market parEcipants) for providing switching and other  network-related  services,  as  well  as  by  charging  fees  to  customers  based  primarily  on  the  gross  dollar  volume  of  acEvity  (GDV,  which  includes  both domesEc and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry the Company's brands.  As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its customers with conEnuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transacEon processing over the contractual term.  ConsideraEon is variable and is recognized as revenue in the period in which volumes and transactions occur.\n\n## Value-added services and solutions\n\nThe Company generates revenues from value-added services and soluEons through either fixed or transacEon-based fees.  These services and soluEons can be i ntegra ted a nd s old with the Company's payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone basis. These services and soluEons primarily include security s ol uEons,  consumer  acquisiEon  and  engagement  services,  business  and  market  insights,  digital  and  authenEcaEon  soluEons,  processing  and  gateway,  ACH batch and real-Eme account-based payments and soluEons, and open banking.  Revenue from these services and soluEons is recognized in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or transactions occur.",

By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Mastercard classified its revenues into two distinct categories: payment network and value-added services, with the payment network primarily generating revenue from fees based on GDV and network-related services.",

        "Step 3: The change from a dual classification of revenue in 2023 to a single reportable segment in 2024 indicates a transformation in how Mastercard organizes and reports on its payment network business, reflecting a more integrated and unified approach."

Market risk is the potenEal for economic losses to be i ncurred on market risk sensiEve instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform its obligaEons in accordance with contractual terms. The Company's  derivaEve  contracts  are  subject  to  enforceable  master  neUng  arrangements,  which  contain  various  neUng  and  setoff  provisions. However,  the Company has elected to present derivaEve assets and liabiliEes on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.  To miEgate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivaEve contracts with a diversified group of selected financial insEtuEons based upon their credit raEngs and other factors. Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.\n\n## Note 24. Segment Reporting\n\nMastercard has concluded it has one reportable operating segment, 'Payment Solutions.' The Payment Solutions segment derives its revenues from a wide range of payment soluEons provided to customers. Revenue is generated from offering customers access to Mastercard's conEnuous payment network, as well as by providing value-added services and soluEons, whether integrated and sold with the payment network or on a stand-alone basis. Revenue is recognized when s e rvi ce s   a re   pe rforme d  i n  a n  a mount  tha t  re fle cts   the   cons i de ra Eon  to  whi ch  the   Compa ny  expects   to  be  enEtl ed  i n  excha nge  for  thos e  s ervi ces   (i .e.,  fees charged  to  customers).

The  CODM  assesses  performance  for  the  Payment SoluEons  segment  and  decides  how  to  allocate  resources,  including  whether  to  reinvest  profits  into  the  Payment  SoluEons  segment  or  into  other  business acEviEes such as for acquisiEons, to pay dividends or for share repurchases, based on net income as reported on the consolidated statements of operaEons ('Consolidated Net Income').

      "answer": "In 2023, card issuance volumes were among the factors considered by management in estimating rebates and incentives, which contributed to $25.1 billion in total net revenue. By 2024, this figure increased to $28.2 billion, and the relationship evolved such that management's estimation process became more dependent on card issuance and conversion volumes as key performance indicators. This indicates a stronger linkage between customer performance metrics and financial outcomes over time.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) was described in detail with a focus on how currency translation and transactional currency impacts affected GDV growth, including specific percentages: GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4%, while on a local currency basis it increased 11.9% compared to 2022. In contrast, in 2024, GDV was presented in a chart format that highlighted GDV values and the number of cards for select programs and solutions, without explicit mention of currency effects or year-over-year growth percentages. This represents a shift from a narrative explanation of GDV dynamics in 2023 to a more visual and program-specific representation in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the Payment Network was a distinct and significant contributor to net revenue growth, with an 11% operational growth rate.",

Market risk is the potenEal for economic losses to be i ncurred on market risk sensiEve instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform its obligaEons in accordance with contractual terms. The Company's  derivaEve  contracts  are  subject  to  enforceable  master  neUng  arrangements,  which  contain  various  neUng  and  setoff  provisions. However,  the Company has elected to present derivaEve assets and liabiliEes on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.  To miEgate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivaEve contracts with a diversified group of selected financial insEtuEons based upon their credit raEngs and other factors. Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.\n\n## Note 24. Segment Reporting\n\nMastercard has concluded it has one reportable operating segment, 'Payment Solutions.' The Payment Solutions segment derives its revenues from a wide range of payment soluEons provided to customers. Revenue is generated from offering customers access to Mastercard's conEnuous payment network, as well as by providing value-added services and soluEons, whether integrated and sold with the payment network or on a stand-alone basis. Revenue is recognized when s e rvi ce s   a re   pe rforme d  i n  a n  a mount  tha t  re fle cts   the   cons i de ra Eon  to  whi ch  the   Compa ny  expects   to  be  enEtl ed  i n  excha nge  for  thos e  s ervi ces   (i .e.,  fees charged  to  customers).

The  CODM  assesses  performance  for  the  Payment SoluEons  segment  and  decides  how  to  allocate  resources,  including  whether  to  reinvest  profits  into  the  Payment  SoluEons  segment  or  into  other  business acEviEes such as for acquisiEons, to pay dividends or for share repurchases, based on net income as reported on the consolidated statements of operaEons ('Consolidated Net Income').

      "answer": "In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased by 10.4%, while in 2024, the company reported GDV growth on a local currency basis of 11%. This indicates that the company's GDV growth in U.S. dollar terms slowed relative to local currency growth in 2023, suggesting a stronger U.S. dollar during that year. In 2024, the focus shifted to local currency growth without a reported U.S. dollar-converted figure, implying a potential strategic emphasis on underlying volume performance independent of currency fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis grew by 10.4%, compared to local currency growth of 11.9%, indicating a negative impact from currency translation.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company reported GDV growth on a local currency basis of 11%, but did not provide a U.S. dollar-converted growth figure, suggesting a shift in emphasis toward currency-neutral performance.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in how the company communicates GDV performance, focusing more on local currency growth in 2024, which indicates a possible stabilization or strategic reframing of currency exposure."

      "answer": "In 2023, card conversion volumes were considered as part of the estimation factors for rebates and incentives, which contributed to $25.1 billion in total net revenue. By 2024, the net revenue increased to $28.2 billion, and card conversion volumes became a more integral component, indicating a shift from being a general consideration to a dependency in the estimation process. This reflects a growing strategic and financial reliance on card conversion volumes in managing customer agreements and forecasting rebates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, card conversion volumes were listed among several factors considered in estimating customer performance for rebates and incentives, suggesting a general but not central role.",
        "In 2024, the language evolved to position card conversion volumes as a key dependency in the estimation process, indicating a stronger emphasis on this metric in financial forecasting and audit procedures.",
        "The increase in net revenue from $25.1 billion to $28.2 billion supports the idea that the company's financial model became more reliant on card conversion volumes, marking a meaningful evolution in its strategic importance."

The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incenEves within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable.  Variable rebates and incenEves are recorded primarily when volume- and transacEonbased revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Variable rebates and incenEves are calculated based upon esEmated customer performance, such as volume  thresholds,  and  the  terms  of  the  related  business  agreements.

      "answer": "In 2023, the company reported a gross dollar volume (GDV) of $9.0 trillion, reflecting a 12% increase on a local currency basis. This quantitative disclosure highlighted growth momentum and provided insight into the company's expanding transactional scale. However, in 2024, the company shifted its GDV reporting approach by focusing on qualitative aspects, such as a chart detailing GDV and number of cards for select programs and solutions, without disclosing the total GDV figure. This change indicates a strategic pivot from broad volume reporting to a more targeted view of GDV performance by program, suggesting a refined reporting focus aligned with specific business initiatives.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the company disclosed a total GDV of $9.0 trillion with a 12% growth on a local currency basis.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from disclosing a comprehensive GDV figure to a segmented view indicates a change in reporting focus and strategic emphasis."

In 2024, while no updated GDV figure was provided, the company introduced a more detailed explanation of GDV, clarifying that it includes both purchase volume and cash volume, and specifying that cross-border volume growth is measured separately. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced approach to currency conversion, using quarterly average exchange rates to calculate U.S. dollar equivalents.

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and impact of domestic assessments on key metrics evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to currency translation effects?",
      "answer": "In 2023, domestic assessments were indirectly impacted by currency translation, as changes in exchange rates affected the calculation of GDV, which in turn influenced key metrics including domestic assessments. GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4% in 2023, compared to a local currency increase of 11.9%, showing a negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar. In 2024, domestic assessments were more directly defined as charges based on activity where the merchant and issuance country are the same, primarily driven by domestic dollar volume of activity such as purchase and cash volume. While the 2024 report does not explicitly reference currency effects on GDV, the shift in focus from currency-impacted metrics to a more activity-driven explanation suggests a change in how domestic assessments are internally monitored and reported, moving away from emphasizing currency translation effects.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, domestic assessments were indirectly influenced by currency translation effects due to their relationship with GDV, which was impacted by exchange rate fluctuations (e.g., GDV growth of 10.4% on a USD basis vs. 11.9% on a local currency basis).",
        "In 2024, domestic assessments were described as being primarily driven by domestic dollar volume of activity or the number of cards issued, with no mention of currency translation effects, indicating a shift in focus toward transactional volume rather than currency-adjusted metrics.",
        "The change reflects a transformation in how domestic assessments are framed and analyzed over time, moving from a currency-sensitive metric to a more operationally focused, volume-driven performance indicator."

Assessments  are  used i nternally by management to monitor operaEng performance as it allows for comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trends. Assessments  do  not represent our net revenue.\n\nThe following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:\n\n- DomesHc assessments are charges based on acEvity related to cards that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domesEc dollar volume of acEvity (e.g., domesEc purchase volume, domesEc cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n- Cross-border assessments are charges based on acEvity related to cards that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are  different.  These  assessments  are  primarily  driven  by  the  cross-border  dollar  volume  of  acEvity  (e.g.,  cross-border  purchase  volume,  cross-border  cash volume).\n- Transaction processing assessments a re  cha rges  pri ma ri l y dri ve n by the number of s witched tra ns a ctions  on our pa yment network. Switching activities include:\n- Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval\n- Cl e a ri ng, the  determina Eon and exchange of financial transacEon informaEon between issuers and acquirers aVer a transacEon has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction\n- Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\n\nThese  assessments  can  also  include  connecEvity  services  and  network  access,  which  are  based  on  the  volume  of  data  transmiNed  and  the  number  of authorization and settlement messages.\n\n- Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\n\n## 51 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, restricted security deposits held for customers contributed to an $0.8 billion increase in net cash provided by operating activities. By 2024, the amount of restricted security deposits held for customers was $1,874 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $1,845 million in 2023, indicating a modest increase of $29 million. This suggests that while the absolute level of restricted deposits continued to rise, the specific impact on operating cash flow was not as prominently highlighted in 2024 as it was in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the increase in restricted security deposits held for customers was a contributing factor to the $0.8 billion rise in net cash from operating activities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the restricted security deposits held for customers were disclosed as $1,874 million (2024) versus $1,845 million (2023), showing a $29 million increase.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a continued growth in the volume of restricted deposits, but the specific impact on operating cash flow was not reiterated in 2024, suggesting a shift in emphasis or a more stable role in cash flow dynamics."

      "answer": "In 2023, variable rebates and incentives were a portion of total net revenue of $25.1 billion, while in 2024, this figure increased to $28.2 billion. The methodology for estimating these rebates remained consistent, based on customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds, forecasted transactions, card issuance, and historical experience.

The audit procedures also remained consistent, emphasizing the significance and complexity of estimating these incentives.",

The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incenEves within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable.  Variable rebates and incenEves are recorded primarily when volume- and transacEonbased revenues are recognized over the contractual term.

      "question": "How did the presentation and measurement of Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of currency conversion methodology and the reported growth rates on U.S. dollar-converted versus local currency bases?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GDV was reported with a focus on the impact of currency translation and transactional currency, specifically highlighting that GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4% compared to 11.9% on a local currency basis versus 2022. In 2024, the presentation of GDV became more standardized, with an explicit statement that U.S. dollar-converted GDV figures are calculated using quarterly average exchange rates, and the emphasis shifted to reporting period-over-period growth rates based on local currency data to eliminate currency fluctuation effects. The 2024 disclosure formalized the methodology and removed specific comparative growth figures, suggesting a more methodological and consistent approach to GDV reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, GDV was discussed in the context of currency impacts, with specific growth percentages provided (10.4% on U.S. dollar-converted basis vs. 11.9% on local currency basis).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, GDV was described with a standardized methodology using quarterly average exchange rates, and the focus shifted to local currency-based growth rates without specific comparative figures.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from emphasizing currency impact effects with concrete growth numbers to a more formalized, methodological approach that standardizes GDV reporting and removes year-over-year comparisons in favor of consistent measurement."

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

These assessments are primarily driven by the domesEc dollar volume of acEvity (e.g., domesEc purchase volume, domesEc cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n- Cross-border assessments are charges based on acEvity related to cards that carry the Company's brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are  different.  These  assessments  are  primarily  driven  by  the  cross-border  dollar  volume  of  acEvity  (e.g.,  cross-border  purchase  volume,  cross-border  cash volume).\n- Transaction processing assessments a re  cha rges  pri ma ri l y dri ve n by the number of s witched tra ns a ctions  on our pa yment network. Switching activities include:\n- Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval\n- Cl e a ri ng, the  determina Eon and exchange of financial transacEon informaEon between issuers and acquirers aVer a transacEon has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction\n- Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\n\nThese  assessments  can  also  include  connecEvity  services  and  network  access,  which  are  based  on  the  volume  of  data  transmiNed  and  the  number  of authorization and settlement messages.\n\n- Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\n\n## 51 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K",

      "question": "How has the presentation and disclosure of Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the level of quantitative detail provided in the annual reports?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) was reported with specific quarterly and annual growth percentages, such as a 21% annual increase in GDV on a local currency basis. By 2024, the reporting shifted to a more qualitative format, where GDV was referenced but not accompanied by the same level of detailed quantitative performance metrics, instead being presented in a chart without explicit growth figures or time-based comparisons.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, MA provided detailed quarterly and annual growth percentages for GDV, including a 21% annual increase on a local currency basis.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, MA referenced GDV in the context of a chart for select programs and solutions but did not disclose specific growth percentages or comparative figures over time.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from detailed quantitative disclosure in 2022 to a more qualitative or summarized presentation in 2024, indicating a transformation in how GDV performance is communicated."

      "answer": "In 2022, Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) showed mixed quarterly performance with an 8% increase in March, a 10% decrease in June, and 1% increases in September and December, resulting in an overall flat annual change. By 2024, the company formalized its reporting methodology, emphasizing GDV as a key metric that includes both purchase and cash volume on a local currency and USD-converted basis, with cross-border growth also tracked separately. This reflects a shift from ad hoc quarterly reporting to a more structured and strategic approach in tracking GDV.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how GDV is treated by the company \u2014 from a fluctuating operational indicator in 2022 to a formalized, strategic key metric in 2024."

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) was explicitly linked to financial performance, with GDV growth of 21% on a local currency basis directly contributing to a 22% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis. By 2024, while GDV was still a key metric, it was described more in terms of its structural definition and reporting methodology, without specific growth figures or direct linkage to revenue performance. This indicates a shift from emphasizing GDV's financial impact to focusing on its role as a descriptive business metric.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, GDV growth of 21% on a local currency basis was a primary driver of a 22% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis, showing a strong financial impact.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, GDV was defined and categorized as a key business metric, but no specific growth figures or direct financial impact were mentioned, indicating a more structural or descriptive focus.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how GDV was positioned \u2014 from a performance driver with quantified impact in 2022 to a more neutral, descriptive metric in 2024."

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

      "question": "How has the relationship between Gross Dollar Volume and net revenue growth evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's revenue drivers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gross Dollar Volume growth on a local currency basis was 21%, contributing significantly to a 22% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis. By 2024, Gross Dollar Volume grew at a slower pace of 11% on a local currency basis, despite net revenue increasing by 13% on a currency-neutral basis. This indicates that while Gross Dollar Volume remained a key revenue driver, its contribution to overall revenue growth diminished over time, suggesting that other factors, such as pricing, product mix, or additional service offerings, became more influential in driving revenue growth in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Gross Dollar Volume growth was 21% on a local currency basis, directly contributing to the 22% net revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Gross Dollar Volume growth slowed to 11% on a local currency basis, while net revenue growth remained strong at 13% on a currency-neutral basis.",
        "Step 3: The reduced growth rate of Gross Dollar Volume relative to net revenue suggests a shift in the primary drivers of revenue, indicating a transformation in how Gross Dollar Volume contributes to overall financial performance."

      "question": "How has Mastercard's exposure to cross-border volume fees evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of their revenue generation model and external risk factors?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard's revenue generation model included cross-border volume fees as a core component of its payments network services, alongside domestic assessments and transaction processing fees. These fees were derived from the dollar volume of activity (GDV) on Mastercard-branded products. By 2024, while cross-border volume fees remained a significant revenue source, the company highlighted increased exposure to external risks such as geopolitical conflicts, global pandemics, and regulatory actions like those from the G20 Financial Stability Board targeting cross-border interchange fees. These evolving risk factors indicate a growing vulnerability in the stability of cross-border volume fees as a revenue stream.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, cross-border volume fees were a standard and stable part of Mastercard's revenue model, derived from GDV on Mastercard-branded products.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, cross-border volume fees remained significant, but the company explicitly warned of increasing risks including geopolitical instability, global health events, and regulatory scrutiny that could negatively impact these fees.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change is in the risk profile and external pressures affecting cross-border volume fees, indicating a transformation in how this revenue stream is perceived and managed."

This acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Note 3. Revenue\n\nMastercard's core network involves four participants in addition to the Company: account holders (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders' financial institutions), merchants and acquirers (the merchants' financial institutions). Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenue recognized from domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and transaction processing are derived from Mastercard's payments network services.  Revenue  is  primarily  generated  by  charging  fees  to  issuers,  acquirers  and  other  stakeholders  for  providing  switching services, as well as by assessing customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or GDV, on the products that carry the Company's brands. Revenue is generally derived from information accumulated by Mastercard's systems or reported by customers. In  addition,  the  Company  generates  other  revenues  from  value-added  products  and  services,  often  integrated  and  sold  with  the Company's payment offerings, that are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related transactions occur or services are performed.",

Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n- Customers miEgaEng their economic exposure by limiEng the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesEng greater incenEve or greater cost stability from us\n- Consumers and businesses reducing spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend\n- Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. have affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer confidence and spending\n- Government intervenEon (including the effect of laws, regulaEons and/or government investments on or in our financial insEtuEon customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing poliEcal regimes in execuEve, legislaEve and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potenEal negaEve effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products\n- Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility\n\nCross-border  transac'ons. We switch substanEally all cross-border transacEons using  Mastercard,  Maestro and  Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount  of  revenue  from  cross-border  volume  fees  and  fees  related  to  switched  transacEons. Revenue  from  switching  cross-border  and  currency  conversion tra ns a cEons  for our customers fluctuates with the levels and desEnaEons of cross-border travel and our customers' need for transacEons to be converted into their  base  currency.

AddiEonally, any regulaEon of i nterregional interchange fees could also negaEvely impact our cross-border acEvity (for example, the targets announced by the  G20  Financial  Stability  Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive.\n\nRussia's  invasion  of  Ukraine.

          "chunk_text": "- Fair value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability ('hedged item') that is attributable to the hedged risk. All amounts recognized in earnings are recorded to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statement of operations as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Hedged items are measured on the consolidated balance sheet at their carrying amount adjusted for any changes in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  ('basis  adjustments').  The  Company  defers  the  amortization  of  any  basis adjustments until the end of the derivative instrument's term. If the hedge designation is discontinued for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item, the remaining basis adjustments are amortized in accordance with applicable GAAP for the hedged item.\n- Net investment hedges - The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.  The  effective  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  related  to  the  hedging  instruments  are  reported  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  a  cumulative  translation  adjustment component of equity. Gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings only if the Company sells or substantially liquidates its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.\n\nSettlement  assets/obligations -  The  Company  operates  systems  for  settling  payment  transactions  among  participants  in  the payments ecosystem in which the Company operates. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day basis, however, in some circumstances, funds may not settle until subsequent business days. In addition, the Company may receive or post funds in advance of  transactions related to certain payment capabilities over its multi-rail payments network. The Company classifies the balances arising from these various activities as settlement assets and settlement obligations.\n\nProperty,  equipment  and  right-of-use  assets -  Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements and amortization of finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Operating lease amortization expense is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThe useful lives of the Company's assets are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How has the treatment and impact of cross-border volume fees on Mastercard's revenue evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to foreign currency effects and external economic or geopolitical factors?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard highlighted that cross-border volume fees were significantly influenced by foreign currency effects, with GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increasing by 21.9% in 2021 compared to 2020, while local currency GDV growth was 20.5%. The company actively managed transactional currency exposure through foreign exchange derivatives, with some contracts designated as cash flow hedges. By 2024, the focus had shifted to broader external risks, including geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war), global pandemics, and regulatory actions like G20 targets on cross-border interchange fees, which were described as potentially negatively impacting cross-border volume fees. Unlike in 2022, where the emphasis was on currency conversion mechanics and hedging, 2024 framed cross-border volume fees as vulnerable to a wider set of macroeconomic and regulatory disruptions, signaling a strategic shift in risk perception and exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company disclosed that cross-border volume fees were affected by foreign currency translation and transactional impacts, with specific GDV growth metrics (21.9% USD-converted vs. 20.5% local currency) and hedging strategies outlined.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the narrative evolved to emphasize broader macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and G20 regulatory targets, which were stated to 'negatively impact' cross-border volume fees.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a focus on currency mechanics and hedging in 2022 to a broader set of external threats in 2024 indicates a transformation in how cross-border volume fees are perceived in terms of risk and revenue stability."

          "chunk_text": "Operating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n- Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard's transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard's customers. 1\n- Growth rates are normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where transactions  and  volumes  from  days  where  the  Company  does  not  clear  and  settle  are  processed.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  began clearing and settling transactions and volumes on a daily basis. 2\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\n## Currency Impact\n\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, Brazilian real and the British pound. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\n\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting  revenue  and  expense  transactions  occurring  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional  currency.  Changes  in  currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ('GDV') and gross euro volume ('GEV'), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and certain volume-related rebates and incentives. In most nonEuropean regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates  for  the  period.  In  Europe,  GEV  is  calculated  based  on  local  currency  spending  volume  converted  to  euros  using  average exchange  rates  for  the  period. As  a  result,  certain  of  our  domestic  assessments,  cross-border  volume  fees  and  volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S.  dollar,  however,  consumer  spend  in  Australia  is  in  the  Australian  dollar.  The  currency  transactional  impact  of  converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis.  In  2021,  GDV  on  a  U.S.  dollar-converted  basis  increased  21.9%,  while  GDV  on  a  local  currency  basis  increased  20.5% versus 2020. In 2020, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis decreased 1.9%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 0.1% versus 2019. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\n\nThrough  December  31,  2020,  our  approach  to  managing  transactional  currency  exposure  consisted  of  hedging  a  portion  of anticipated revenues impacted by transactional currencies by entering into foreign exchange derivative contracts, and recording the related changes in fair value in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. During the first quarter  of  2021,  we  started  to  formally  designate  certain  newly-executed  foreign  exchange  derivative  contracts,  which  meet  the established accounting criteria,  as  cash  flow  hedges.  Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  changes  in  fair  value  of  these  designated contracts  are  deferred  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  and  subsequently  recognized  in  the  respective component of net revenue when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Activity\n\nWe  incur  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  from  remeasuring  monetary  assets  and  liabilities,  including  settlement  assets  and obligations, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The impact of this foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\n\nOur  foreign  exchange  risk  management  activities  are  discussed  further  in  Note  23  (Derivative  and  Hedging  Instruments)  to  the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\n## Risk of Currency Devaluation\n\nWe are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into U.S. dollars. While these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.",

Any adverse finding could subject us to civil or criminal penalEes, sancEons, or suspension or disbarment.\n\n- Working or contracEng with governments, either directly or via our financial insEtuEon customers, can subject us to heightened reputaEonal risks, including extensive scruEny and publicity, as well as a potenEal associaEon with the policies of those governments.  Any negaEve publicity or negaEve associaEon with  a  government  enEty,  regardless  of  its  accuracy,  may  adversely  affect  our  reputaEon. In  a ddiEon,  threat  intelligence  gathering  services  provided  to governments through our acquisition of Recorded Future could negatively impact how we are viewed by other jurisdictions.\n\nAny of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.\n\n## Global Economic and Political Environment\n\n## Global economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance.  Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n- Customers miEgaEng their economic exposure by limiEng the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesEng greater incenEve or greater cost stability from us\n- Consumers and businesses reducing spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend\n- Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. have affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer confidence and spending\n- Government intervenEon (including the effect of laws, regulaEons and/or government investments on or in our financial insEtuEon customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing poliEcal regimes in execuEve, legislaEve and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potenEal negaEve effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products\n- Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility\n\nCross-border  transac'ons. We switch substanEally all cross-border transacEons using  Mastercard,  Maestro and  Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount  of  revenue  from  cross-border  volume  fees  and  fees  related  to  switched  transacEons. Revenue  from  switching  cross-border  and  currency  conversion tra ns a cEons  for our customers fluctuates with the levels and desEnaEons of cross-border travel and our customers' need for transacEons to be converted into their  base  currency.  Cross-border  acEvity  has  been,  and  may  conEnue  to  be,  adversely  affected  by  world  geopoliEcal,  economic,  health,  weather  and  other conditions. These include or have included:\n\n- Global pandemics (and related post-pandemic global economic impacts) and potenEal separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics)\n- Current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business\n- The threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change)\n\nThe impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ulEmately decrease cross-border acEvity.  AddiEonally, any regulaEon of i nterregional interchange fees could also negaEvely impact our cross-border acEvity (for example, the targets announced by the  G20  Financial  Stability  Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive.\n\nRussia's  invasion  of  Ukraine. In  a ddiEon to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sancEons and our decision to suspend our business operaEons  in  Russia  has  led,  and  could  further  lead,  to  other  legal  ramificaEons  and  operaEonal  challenges,  including  fines,  the  naEonalizaEon  of  our s ubsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.\n\nStandards. Our operaEons as a global payments network rely in part on global interoperable standards to help facilitate payments. To the extent geopoliEcal events or government intervenEon result in jurisdicEons no longer parEcipaEng in the creaEon or adopEon of these standards, or the creaEon of compeEng s ta nda rds , our products and services could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny of these developments potentially could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, translation adjustments on net investment hedges were reported at a value of $(38) million, which decreased further to $(175) million by the end of the year. By 2024, the starting value was $309 million, which decreased to $181 million by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant shift in the company's foreign currency exposure management, transitioning from a net liability position to a net asset position over the two-year period. The change highlights a strategic evolution in how the company is hedging its foreign currency risks.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, translation adjustments on net investment hedges started at $(38) million and decreased to $(175) million by the end of the year.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, translation adjustments on net investment hedges started at $309 million and decreased to $181 million by the end of 2023.",
        "Step 3: The change from a negative value in 2022 to a positive value in 2024 indicates a transformation in the company's foreign currency exposure management, moving from a liability to an asset position."
