      "answer": "In 2021, Linde reported net purchases of ordinary shares amounting to $4,562 million, reflecting a significant buyback activity. By 2024, net purchases of ordinary shares slightly decreased to $4,451 million. This indicates that the company maintained a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, albeit at a slightly reduced pace in 2024 compared to 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

Sales increased 2% from higher price attainment primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments. Sales from volume were flat as growth from new project start-ups was offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, largely in the Americas and APAC.\n- Reported operating profit of $8,635 million was 8% above 2023 reported operating profit of $8,024 million. Adjusted operating profit of $9,720 million was 7% above 2023 adjusted operating profit of $9,070 million. The increase in the reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives in 2024. These increases more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation and currency translation.*\n- Net income - Linde plc of $6,565 million and diluted earnings per share of $13.62 increased from $6,199 million and $12.59, respectively in 2023. Adjusted net income - Linde plc of $7,475 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.51 were 7% above 2023 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,423 million was $118 million above 2023. The increase was driven by higher net income, partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $4,497 million; dividends paid were $2,655 million; net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million; and debt borrowings, net were $3,167 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2025 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

The increase in the year was driven by higher volumes and price, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. Cost reduction programs and other charges were $273 million in 2021 and $506 million in 2020.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2021 decreased $38 million, or 33%, versus 2020 . On an adjusted basis interest expense decreased $54 million, or 29% in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\nOn both a reported and adjusted basis, the decrease year over year was driven by a lower effective borrowing rate and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on an unhedged intercompany loan in the prior year.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $192 million and $177 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in benefit largely relates to a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2021 was 24.7% versus 25.0% in 2020. The decrease is primarily driven by increased pre-tax income and jurisdictional mix. 2021 includes a deferred income tax charge related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities for a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom, offset by a reduction to tax expense related to uncertain tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of $47 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2021 was 24.1% versus 23.8% in 2020. The increase in the adjusted ETR is primarily due to lower tax benefits in 2021 relative to higher pre-tax income.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2021 was $119 million as compared to $85 million in 2020. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2021 was $231 million versus $142 million in 2020.\n\nOn a reported basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021, partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segment in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests from continuing operations\n\nAt December 31, 2021, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders' investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies.\n\nReported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $10 million, from $125 million in 2020 to $135 million in 2021, primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $36 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa, which more than offset the increase from higher income from continuing operations.\n\n## Income from continuing operations\n\nReported income from continuing operations increased $1,324 million, or 53%, primarily due to higher overall operating profit.",

On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.

By 2024, the reserves related to these receivables increased to $36 million, and they were now combined with receivables from the sale of GIST, indicating a shift in the composition of this category.

Volume growth across all end markets and project start-ups increased sales by 8% . Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Favorable currency translation and higher cost pass-through increased sales by 5%, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which decreased sales by 3% .\n- Reported operating profit of $4,984 million was 50% above 2020. Adjusted operating profit of $7,176 million was 24% above 2020. The increase in both reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and other charges and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC.*\n- Income from continuing operations of $3,821 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.32 increased from $2,497 million and $4.70, respectively in 2020. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $5,579 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.69 were 28% and 30%, respectively above 2020 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,725 million was 31% above 2020. Capital expenditures were $3,086 million; dividends paid were $2,189 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $4,562 million; and debt repayments, net were $514 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income, which was partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments, and higher cash taxes.\n\n## Investing\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $4,644 million in 2024 compared to $4,670 million in 2023. The decrease was due to lower acquisition spend and higher proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, which more than offset higher capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2024 were $4,497 million, an increase of $710 million from 2023.

Divestitures decreased sales by 3% primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $2,160 million, or 14%, for the year primarily due to higher volumes, cost pass-through and currency impacts, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 57.0% and 56.5% of sales, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher cost pass-through.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&amp;A\") decreased $4 million, from $3,193 in 2020 to $3,189 million in 2021. SG&amp;A was 10.4% of sales in 2021 versus 11.7% in 2020, primarily due to continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher cost pass-through on sales. Currency impacts increased SG&amp;A by approximately $62 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&amp;A decreased due to continued productivity initiatives.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nReported depreciation and amortization expense increased $9 million versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts, partially offset by a decrease related primarily to intangible assets acquired in the merger becoming fully amortized.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $66 million, or 2%, versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts which increased depreciation and amortization by approximately $60 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying depreciation was relatively flat as the impact of new project start ups was largely offset by the decrease related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Cost reduction programs and other charges\n\nLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $273 million and $506 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the company's cost reduction program, which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nOn an adjusted basis, these costs have been excluded in both periods.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nReported operating profit increased $1,662 million in 2021, or 50%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%, for 2021 versus 2020.",

Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between  a  traditional  benefit  (the  'Traditional  Design')  and  an  account-based  benefit  (the  'Account-Based  Design').  The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant's career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after  April  30,  2002  into  businesses  adopting  this  plan.  The  U.S.  pension  plan  assets  are  comprised  of  a  diversified  mix  of investments, including corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary  retirement  benefits  primarily  to  higher  level  employees  that  are  unfunded  and  are  nonqualified  for  federal  tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde's non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through  separate  plans.  Obligations  under  such  plans  are  primarily  provided  for  through  diversified  investment  portfolios,  with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.\n\nLinde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the  performance  of  the  corresponding  investment.  There  are  no  minimum  funding  requirements.  The  pension  obligations  in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted.\n\n## Multi-employer Pension Plans\n\nIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (\"MEPs\"), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees.

By 2024, the company demonstrated continued strategic commitment by appointing Juergen Nowicki as CEO of Linde Engineering in April 2024, following his prior role as Senior Vice President, Commercial, and a long career within the company.

Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices. Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

The primary uses of cash included capital expenditures of $4,497 million, net purchases of ordinary shares of $4,451 million, and cash dividends to shareholders of $2,655 million.\n\n## 2024 compared with 2023\n\n## Cash Flows From Operations\n\nCash flows from operations was $9,423 million, an increase of $118 million from 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income, which was partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments, and higher cash taxes.\n\n## Investing\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $4,644 million in 2024 compared to $4,670 million in 2023. The decrease was due to lower acquisition spend and higher proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, which more than offset higher capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2024 were $4,497 million, an increase of $710 million from 2023.

By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering GHG emissions. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\n\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\n\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. Effective November 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for Board oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nAt the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples of such factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nEnvironmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations.

Settlement charges were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $135 million  and  $436  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  funded  status  for  non-U.S.  plans  was  a  deficit  of $1,409 million and $2,334 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S.",

Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024,  subject  to  any  significant  changes  in  ex isting  laws  and  regulations.  Based  on  historical  results  and  current  estimates,  management  does  not  believe  that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nPensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\n\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and 6.02% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\n\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2025 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $145 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.\n\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company's retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.\n\n## Insurance\n\nLinde  purchases  insurance  to  limit  a  variety  of  property  and  casualty  risks,  including  those  related  to  property,  business  interruption,  third-party  liability  and workers' compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States and $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. Through December 31, 2024, the company self retained risk up to \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million deductible on business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. As of January 1, 2025 Linde has a captive insurance company that provides coverage for up to $50 million per event, and $100 million, in the annual aggregate, of losses above local deductibles for property damage and business interruption at the group's sites globally. To mitigate the risk of losses above these self retention levels, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023.

Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How has the role of cost pass-through in Linde's sales performance evolved between 2022 and 2024, given the company's ability to transfer energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers as a key feature of its long-term contracts, indicating a positive impact on its business model. By 2024, this mechanism had a measurable effect, with cost pass-through contributing a -1% change to sales performance, suggesting that rising costs were offset by contractual adjustments. This evolution reflects a shift from a qualitative competitive advantage to a quantifiable factor influencing year-over-year sales dynamics.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The role of cost pass-through evolved from a general strategic benefit to a specific, quantified contributor to sales performance."

From the effective date, the joint venture is reflected as an equity investment on Linde's consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding results reflected in income from equity investments on the consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe fair value of the joint venture at January 1, 2021 was determined using a discounted cash flow model and approximated the carrying  amount  of  its  net  assets.  The  net  carrying  value  of  $852  million  was  mainly  comprised  of  assets  of  approximately $1.9 billion (primarily Other intangibles and Property plant and equipment - net), net of liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion. Upon  deconsolidation  an  equity  investment  was  recorded  representing  Linde's  share  of  the  joint  venture's  net  assets.  The deconsolidation resulted in a gain of $52 million recorded within cost reduction programs and other charges (see Note 3) related to the release of the CTA balance recorded within AOCI. The company did not receive any consideration, cash or otherwise, as part of the deconsolidation.\n\nThe joint venture contributed sales of approximately $600 million in 2020. Future earnings per share will not be affected as the ownership percent remains the same.\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER CHARGES\n\nCost  reduction  programs  and  other  charges  were  $273  million,  $506  million,  and  $567  million  for  the  12  months  ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

By 2024, this figure had increased by $162 million, or 8%, indicating a positive upward trend in sales performance for the segment. However, despite the sales growth, operating profit for the Engineering segment decreased by $81 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher margins in the prior year from the wind-down of sanctioned Russian projects. This suggests that while sales grew, profitability was negatively impacted by the absence of those prior-year benefits.",

Sales increased 2% from higher price attainment primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments. Sales from volume were flat as growth from new project start-ups was offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, largely in the Americas and APAC.\n- Reported operating profit of $8,635 million was 8% above 2023 reported operating profit of $8,024 million. Adjusted operating profit of $9,720 million was 7% above 2023 adjusted operating profit of $9,070 million. The increase in the reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives in 2024. These increases more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation and currency translation.*\n- Net income - Linde plc of $6,565 million and diluted earnings per share of $13.62 increased from $6,199 million and $12.59, respectively in 2023. Adjusted net income - Linde plc of $7,475 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.51 were 7% above 2023 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,423 million was $118 million above 2023. The increase was driven by higher net income, partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $4,497 million; dividends paid were $2,655 million; net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million; and debt borrowings, net were $3,167 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2025 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

      "answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",

Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate: Relates to the current and deferred income tax impact on the adjustments discussed above. The income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using the applicable tax rates for the jurisdictions that were utilized in calculating the GAAP income tax expense (benefit) and included both current and deferred income tax amounts.\n- Adjusted Income from Equity Investments: Represents the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets.\n\nAdjusted Noncontrolling Interests from Continuing Operations: Represents the noncontrolling interests' ownership portion of the adjustments described above determined on an entity by entity basis.\n\n(d) Impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segment\n\n## Net Debt and Adjusted Net Debt\n\nNet debt is a financial liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to evaluate the ability of a company to repay its debt.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

This growth was driven by higher segment operating profits, which rose from $7,176 million in 2022 to $9,720 million in 2024. Additionally, the impact of cost reduction programs and other charges decreased significantly, from a deduction of $273 million in 2022 to $145 million in 2024.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at Completion\n\nAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,867 million of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 was generated from sale of equipment contracts. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimated costs at completion and management's significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management's process for developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions involved evaluating management's ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Stamford, Connecticut February 28, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's or its predecessor's auditor since 1992.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at Completion\n\nAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, $2,322 million of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was generated from sale of equipment contracts. Sales of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Changes to cost estimates and contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as cumulative adjustments for the inception-to-date effect of such change.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the estimated costs at completion and management's significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management's process for developing the estimated costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions involved evaluating management's ability to reasonably estimate costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts on a sample basis by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on similar completed equipment contracts, and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to estimated costs at completion, including actual costs in excess of estimates. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and significant assumptions related to the total estimated material and labor costs.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n## Stamford, Connecticut\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's or its predecessor's auditor since 1992.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2021, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $119 million, with an adjusted figure of $231 million, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in APAC effective January 1, 2021. By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $1,662 million, or 50% in 2021. The increase in the year was driven by higher volumes and price, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. Cost reduction programs and other charges were $273 million in 2021 and $506 million in 2020.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting, cost reduction programs and other charges, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2021 decreased $38 million, or 33%, versus 2020 . On an adjusted basis interest expense decreased $54 million, or 29% in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\nOn both a reported and adjusted basis, the decrease year over year was driven by a lower effective borrowing rate and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency revaluation on an unhedged intercompany loan in the prior year.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $192 million and $177 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in benefit largely relates to a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2021 was 24.7% versus 25.0% in 2020. The decrease is primarily driven by increased pre-tax income and jurisdictional mix. 2021 includes a deferred income tax charge related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities for a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom, offset by a reduction to tax expense related to uncertain tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of $47 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2021 was 24.1% versus 23.8% in 2020. The increase in the adjusted ETR is primarily due to lower tax benefits in 2021 relative to higher pre-tax income.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2021 was $119 million as compared to $85 million in 2020. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2021 was $231 million versus $142 million in 2020.\n\nOn a reported basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021, partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segment in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the increase in income from equity investments was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which is reflected in equity income effective January 1, 2021.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests from continuing operations\n\nAt December 31, 2021, noncontrolling interests from continuing operations consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders' investments in APAC (primarily in China) and surface technologies.\n\nReported noncontrolling interests from continuing operations increased $10 million, from $125 million in 2020 to $135 million in 2021, primarily driven by higher income from continuing operations, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests from continuing operations decreased $36 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) and the buyout of minority shareholders in the Republic of South Africa, which more than offset the increase from higher income from continuing operations.\n\n## Income from continuing operations\n\nReported income from continuing operations increased $1,324 million, or 53%, primarily due to higher overall operating profit.",

The estimated liability is established using statistical analysis and is based upon historical experience, actuarial assumptions and professional judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant  degree  of  inherent  variability.  If  actual  claims  differ  from  the  company's  estimates,  they  will  be  adjusted  at  that  time  and  financial  results  could  be impacted.\n\nLinde recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses. Any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized or pending payments confirmed by its insurance companies.\n\n## SEGMENT DISCUSSION\n\nLinde's operations consist of two major product lines: industrial gases and engineering. As further described in the following paragraph, Linde's industrial gases operations are managed on a geographic basis, which represents three of the company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South  Pacific);  a  fourth  reportable  segment,  which  represents  the  company's  Engineering  business,  designs  and  manufactures  equipment  for  air separation and other industrial gas applications specifically for end customers and is managed on a worldwide basis operating in all geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\n\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen,  helium,  carbon  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,  electronic  gases,  specialty  gases,  acetylene).  Many  of  these  products  are  co-products  of  the  same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde's industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through one of three basic distribution methods: on-site or tonnage; merchant or bulk; and packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution methods are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer's needs and very few of its products can be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\n\nThe company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG  merger, cost reduction program and other charges, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends. This is the manner in which the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde reported contract liabilities of $2,950 million, with $418 million related to suspended engineering projects in Russia due to sanctions. The Engineering business was described as globally managed and involved in designing and manufacturing equipment for air separation and industrial gas applications, with revenue recognized over time based on costs incurred. By 2024, the Engineering business continued to operate globally, with plant components produced in factories across Germany, France, the U.S., and China, and was explicitly described as designing and constructing turnkey process plants for both third-party and internal gases businesses. While specific contract liability figures for 2024 are not provided, the prior year\u2019s liabilities had decreased from 2022 to 2023, with a reclassification of some liabilities to contingent liabilities, indicating a shift in risk exposure. This suggests a strategic adjustment in managing geopolitical risks while maintaining or expanding the global scope of engineering operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

This change was primarily driven by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to a decrease in benefit obligations in 2024, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains compared to 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

The decrease was due to lower acquisition spend and higher proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, which more than offset higher capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2024 were $4,497 million, an increase of $710 million from 2023.

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde acknowledged that environmental protection costs may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and the company faced physical risks from climate change and extreme weather. It also noted that regulations were expected to raise the cost of energy, a significant expense for Linde, and that long-term contracts included provisions to recover increased costs. By 2024, Linde reported that environmental protection costs incurred were not significant and anticipated that future annual expenditures would remain similar to 2024 levels unless there were significant regulatory changes. This indicates a shift from expecting rising costs to a more stable outlook, suggesting improved cost control or regulatory adaptation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncontinues to  develop  new  applications  that  can  help  customers  lower  emissions  by  reducing  energy  consumption  and  increasing  product  throughput.  Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024,  subject  to  any  significant  changes  in  ex isting  laws  and  regulations.  Based  on  historical  results  and  current  estimates,  management  does  not  believe  that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nPensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\n\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and 6.02% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\n\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2025 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $145 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.\n\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company's retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.\n\n## Insurance\n\nLinde  purchases  insurance  to  limit  a  variety  of  property  and  casualty  risks,  including  those  related  to  property,  business  interruption,  third-party  liability  and workers' compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States and $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. Through December 31, 2024, the company self retained risk up to \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million deductible on business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. As of January 1, 2025 Linde has a captive insurance company that provides coverage for up to $50 million per event, and $100 million, in the annual aggregate, of losses above local deductibles for property damage and business interruption at the group's sites globally. To mitigate the risk of losses above these self retention levels, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies.",

For the main non-U.S. plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 5.30%  expected  return), 30%-50%  fixed  income  securities  (approximately 5.80%  expected  return),  and 30%-50%  alternative investments (approximately 5.60% expected return).\n\nFor the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10-year period ended December 31, 2024 was approximately 7.20%. For the non-U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 4.00%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as a factor in estimating the ex pected long term rate of return. For 2025, the ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans and 6.02% for non-U.S. plans.\n\n## Pension Plan Assets\n\nThe investments of the U.S. pension plan are managed to meet the future expected benefit liabilities of the plan over the long term by investing in diversified portfolios  consistent  with  prudent  diversification  and  historical  and  ex pected  capital  market  returns.  Investment  strategies  are  reviewed  by  management  and investment performance is tracked against appropriate benchmarks. There are no concentrations of risk as it relates to the assets within the plans. The non-U.S. pension plans are managed individually based on diversified investment portfolios, with different target asset allocations that vary for each plan.

      "answer": "In 2023, the net interest expense was $200 million, calculated from $480 million in interest incurred on debt and other, partially offset by $197 million in interest income. By 2024, the net interest expense increased to $256 million, driven by a rise in interest incurred on debt and other to $555 million, despite a further increase in interest income to $228 million. This indicates that the company's financing costs grew, and its capital structure management experienced increased pressure due to higher debt-related expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the net interest expense in 2023, which was $200 million, derived from $480 million in interest incurred on debt and other, offset by $197 million in interest income.",
        "Step 2: Identify the net interest expense in 2024, which rose to $256 million, with interest incurred on debt and other increasing to $555 million and interest income rising to $228 million.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change, noting a significant increase in net interest expense ($200 million to $256 million) due to a larger rise in interest incurred on debt and other compared to interest income."

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde's relationship with Linde Engineering was primarily characterized by fixed-price plant sales contracts, with an estimated $48 billion in future minimum purchase obligations. This indicated a strong dependency on Linde Engineering's project delivery capabilities. By 2024, the relationship evolved into a more strategic stake, evidenced by the appointment of Juergen Nowicki as CEO of Linde Engineering in April 2024, signaling a deeper integration and long-term commitment to the engineering segment. This leadership change reflects a shift from transactional dependency to strategic ownership.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Engineering Segment Sales decreased by $602 million, or 22%, compared to 2022, largely due to the winding down of sanctioned Russian projects, which contributed approximately $238 million in 2023 versus $894 million in 2022. In contrast, in 2024, Engineering Segment Sales increased by $162 million, or 8%, compared to 2023, driven by project timing. This represents a significant turnaround from the previous year's decline, indicating a recovery in sales performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nApproximately 58% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 22% in the APAC segment and the rest largely in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $7.1 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

By 2024, the company further disclosed that this deconsolidation was a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and was treated as an asset group impairment event under long-lived assets testing, indicating a shift from a focus on equity treatment to a broader asset impairment and financial impact analysis.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived  assets,  including  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  finite-lived  other  intangible  assets,  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For purposes of this test, asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flows. Based upon Linde's business model an asset group may be a single plant and related assets used to support on-site, merchant and packaged gas customers. Alternatively, the asset group may be a collection of distribution related assets (cylinders, distribution centers, and stores) or be a pipeline complex  which includes multiple interdependent plants and related assets connected by pipelines within a geographic area used to support the same distribution methods. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde had deferred tax assets of $1,289 million (net of valuation allowances of $146 million), and deferred tax liabilities of $6,520 million. At December 31, 2024, uncertain tax positions totaled $292 million (see Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Income tax expense was $2,002 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or about 23.4% of pre-tax income (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to taxes).\n\nIn the preparation of consolidated financial statements, Linde estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions  where  the  company  conducts  business.  Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  represent  tax   benefits  or  obligations  that  arise  from  temporary differences  due  to  differing  treatment  of  certain  items  for  accounting  and  income  tax   purposes.  Linde  evaluates  deferred  tax   assets  each  period  to  ensure  that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character (e.g. capital gain versus ordinary income treatment), amount and timing to result in their recovery. A valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value. Considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters. As events and circumstances change, related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time. Linde's tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities  could  challenge  the  company's  tax   positions.  The  company's  practice  is  to  review  tax   filing  positions  by  jurisdiction  and  to  record  provisions  for uncertain income tax positions, including interest and penalties when applicable. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets. If new information becomes available, adjustments are charged or credited against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe company accrues liabilities for non-income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized or realizable. If new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts, adjustments are charged against income at that time. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations.\n\nLinde is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). Such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures. Linde believes it records and/or discloses such contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company's financial statements.\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nLinde does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.",

In 2024, the company continued to use one-to-three-year supply contracts for packaged gases, and there was no mention of any new minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments, indicating that the contractual flexibility remained consistent. However, the 2024 filing emphasized that revenue for packaged gases is recognized at a point in time, either upon delivery or customer pickup, which adds clarity to the revenue recognition timing not explicitly detailed in 2023.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "question": "How did Linde's Russia-related charges evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of impairment and deconsolidation losses?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Linde incurred a total loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax) due to the deconsolidation of its Russian gas and engineering business entities as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This included a $407 million loss on deconsolidation recorded within Other charges. Additionally, other Russia-related charges in 2022 were $103 million ($73 million after tax), primarily related to asset impairments. In contrast, 2023 saw no further deconsolidation losses, and the total Other charges were $40 million, which included an income tax benefit of $81 million, partially offset by a $85 million accrual for an international income tax matter. This indicates a significant reduction in Russia-related financial impact from 2022 to 2023.",

        "Step 1: Identify the Russia-related charges in 2022, which included a $787 million deconsolidation loss and $103 million in other charges related to asset impairments.",
        "Step 2: Identify the Russia-related charges in 2023, which showed no deconsolidation losses and only $40 million in Other charges, which included a net tax benefit.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change, which shows a transformation from significant impairment and deconsolidation losses in 2022 to a much smaller and structurally different charge in 2023, indicating a stabilization or resolution of earlier issues."

In 2024, the company added specificity by referencing the '2018 business combination,' thereby anchoring the transaction to a concrete year and potentially signaling a longer-term integration phase. This evolution indicates a shift in how Linde contextualizes the merger's impact, moving from a general description to a more historically grounded explanation, which enhances transparency and investor understanding of ongoing purchase accounting effects.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",

        "Step 3: The shift from a supportive mechanism in 2023 to a detractor in 2024 represents a transformation in the role of cost pass-through, likely due to increased cost pressures or reduced ability to pass these costs to customers."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nApproximately 58% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 22% in the APAC segment and the rest largely in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $7.1 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How did Linde plc's Net Pension and OPEB Cost (Benefit), excluding service cost, change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's pension obligations or investment performance?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Linde plc reported a Net Pension and OPEB Cost (Benefit) of $-164 million, excluding service cost. In 2024, this figure decreased further to $-190 million, indicating a 16% increase in the net benefit. This suggests that the company's pension obligations improved or the performance of plan assets deteriorated less than expected, contributing to a larger net benefit in 2024 compared to 2023.",

RETIREMENT PROGRAMS\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.\n\nThe Linde retirement plans are non-contributory defined benefit plans covering eligible employees and its participating affiliates. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between a traditional benefit (the 'Traditional Design') and an accountbased benefit (the 'Account-Based Design'). The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant's career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan.  The  U.S.  pension  plan  assets  are  comprised  of  a  diversified  mix   of  investments,  including  corporate  equities,  government  securities  and  corporate  debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax  purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde's non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.\n\nLinde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in G ermany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in G ermany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the  performance  of  the  corresponding  investment.  There  are  no  minimum  funding  requirements.  The  pension  obligations  in  G ermany  are  partly  funded  by  a Contractual Trust Agreement. Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted.\n\n## Multi-employer Pension Plans\n\nIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (\"MEPs\"), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire on different dates through 2029. In connection with such agreements, the company is required to make periodic contributions to the MEPs in accordance with the terms of the respective collective bargaining",

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, indicating a proactive approach to cost management. By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Linde explicitly described its long-term contracts as enabling the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs, highlighting it as a strategic advantage.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company quantified the impact of cost pass-through as a negative 1% on sales growth, indicating a measurable effect on financial performance.",
        "Step 3: The change from a qualitative strategic benefit in 2023 to a quantified negative impact in 2024 shows an evolution in how cost pass-through affected the company's financials, suggesting a more nuanced or challenged application of the mechanism."

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde spent $953 million on acquisitions, primarily driven by the acquisition of nexAir in the Americas. In contrast, 2024 saw a significant decrease in acquisition spending to $317 million, a decline of $636 million, with the focus shifting to smaller packaged gas businesses in the Americas. This indicates a strategic shift from a major acquisition-led approach to a more selective and smaller-scale inorganic growth strategy in the Americas.",

        "Step 1: Identify the acquisition activity and specific mention of nexAir in 2023, which contributed to a total acquisition spend of $953 million.",

        "Step 3: Compare the two years to conclude that Linde's acquisition strategy shifted from a major strategic move (nexAir) to smaller, more focused additions in the same region."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nApproximately 58% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 22% in the APAC segment and the rest largely in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $7.1 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde explicitly stated that variable components of consideration in merchant contracts were constrained and noted that this consideration was not significant. In 2024, the company removed the specific mention of variable consideration in the merchant business entirely, indicating a shift in emphasis or possibly a simplification of contract terms related to these three to seven year supply agreements. This suggests a strategic or policy evolution in how Linde manages or reports variable consideration in these contracts.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Linde disclosed that variable components of consideration existed in merchant contracts and were considered constrained, though not significant.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, there is no explicit mention of variable consideration in merchant contracts, suggesting either a change in contract structure or a shift in disclosure focus.",
        "Step 3: The removal of the disclosure about variable consideration implies a change in how Linde manages or reports these elements of three to seven year supply agreements, indicating an evolution in financial or contractual strategy."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

On an adjusted basis, the increase was from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024. The year-over-year growth in adjusted income from equity investments was modest, driven by improved performance in certain investments, although in the prior year, a decline was attributed to the overall performance of investments in APAC.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2023, the company disclosed that adjusted income from equity investments was influenced by the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets. By 2024, the adjusted income from equity investments had risen to $242 million from $239 million in 2023. This indicates a slight increase in the adjusted valuation of equity investments, suggesting that the company's fair value adjustments related to these investments remained relatively stable but showed a marginal upward trend over time.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company explained that adjusted income from equity investments was based on the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments tied to depreciable and amortizable assets.",

        "Step 3: The slight increase indicates that the fair value adjustments on equity investments continued to be a factor but had a minimal upward impact year-over-year."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).

On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023.

Additionally, on an adjusted basis, income from equity investments rose from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024.

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of Income from Equity Investments evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its adjustment methodology and reported value?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the company explained that 'Adjusted Income from Equity Investments' represented the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments related to depreciable and amortizable assets, specifically tied to purchase accounting impacts from the Linde AG merger. This was a non-GAAP adjustment aimed at providing a clearer view of operational performance by removing the effects of fair value step-ups. In 2024, the company disclosed a reported value of $170 million for Income from Equity Investments, showing a 2% increase from the $167 million reported in 2023. Unlike 2023, where the focus was on the adjustment methodology, 2024 included the metric in a comparative financial table without specific mention of fair value amortization, suggesting a shift from explaining the adjustment to emphasizing the actual performance of equity investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - The 2023 filing described Income from Equity Investments as being adjusted for the amortization of increased fair value on equity investments, primarily due to the Linde AG merger.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - In 2024, the Income from Equity Investments was reported at $170 million, a 2% increase from $167 million in 2023, and was included in a comparative financial table without detailed adjustment explanation.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The focus shifted from explaining the adjustment methodology in 2023 to reporting the metric's performance in 2024, indicating a change in how the company communicated the significance of this metric."

The company also designs, engineers, and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers its customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\n\nLinde's industrial gas operations are managed on a geographical basis and in 2024 89% of sales were generated by Linde's three geographic segments (Americas, EMEA and APAC) and the remaining 11% were related largely to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent Other (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for operating segment details).\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics. The diversity of end-markets supports financial stability for Linde in varied business cycles.\n\nLinde's industrial gas business generates most of its revenues and earnings in the following geographies where the company has its strongest market positions and where distribution and production operations allow the company to deliver the highest level of service to its customers at the lowest cost.\n\n",

      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, merger-related costs for 2022 were clearly disclosed as $139 million ($93 million after tax), primarily related to severance actions, impairment of an equity method investment, and the sale of the GIST business. By the 2024 filing, the company repeated the same disclosure about 2022 merger-related costs without introducing any new or updated figures for 2023 or 2024. This indicates that the company did not incur new merger-related costs in 2023 or 2024, and the disclosure remained static, suggesting the merger integration activities had concluded or were no longer material.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In the 2023 filing, merger-related costs for 2022 were specifically quantified at $139 million pre-tax and were tied to identifiable actions like severance and asset impairments.",
        "Step 2: In the 2024 filing, the same disclosure about 2022 merger-related costs was repeated verbatim without any new or updated figures for 2023 or 2024.",
        "Step 3: The absence of new or updated merger-related cost figures in the 2024 filing suggests that such costs were either no longer incurred or no longer material to the company's financial reporting."

By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Engineering Segment Operating Profit was $473 million, as shown in the operating profit table. In 2023, this figure decreased by $64 million, or 12%, resulting in an operating profit of $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower sales, including the impact of terminated or suspended projects in Russia, which accounted for approximately $894 million in sales in 2022 and only $238 million in 2023. Despite the drop in sales, the profit decline was partially offset by higher margins realized during the wind-down of sanctioned projects.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Linde disclosed the use of long-term contracts that allowed for passing through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, emphasizing stability in cash flow.",

        "Step 3: The change shows that while cost pass-through remained in place, its financial impact shifted from being a stabilizing factor to a source of sales headwind, suggesting evolving cost pressures or market conditions."
