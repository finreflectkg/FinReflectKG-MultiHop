By 2024, this exposure increased significantly to $42 million on the asset side and $110 million on the liability side, indicating a more pronounced use of derivatives for regulatory hedging.

      "question": "How did the treatment or significance of unamortized ITCs within regulatory liabilities evolve between 2022 and 2024, based on the disclosures in the 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, unamortized ITCs were disclosed as part of regulatory liabilities, primarily attributed to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law. By 2024, unamortized ITCs continued to be included in regulatory liabilities, but the disclosure emphasized their ongoing impact on the financial structure rather than just being a disclosed item. However, the specific balances for unamortized ITCs were not quantified in either year, indicating a consistent qualitative treatment but no explicit quantitative evolution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, unamortized ITCs were disclosed as part of regulatory liabilities, with a reference to Note 2 for balances at December 31, 2021, and 2020, though no specific figures were included in the provided chunk.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, unamortized ITCs were again included in regulatory liabilities, with a reference to Note 2 for balances at December 31, 2024 and 2023, but again without specific figures in the provided chunk.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The treatment of unamortized ITCs remained consistent in terms of categorization, but the shift from 'discloses' to 'impacts' suggests a subtle change in how the company frames their significance, though no quantitative change can be determined from the provided evidence."

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power had 241 employees, making it one of the larger operating segments of Southern Company, which had a total of 1,728 employees across all its entities. By 2024, while specific employee numbers for Alabama Power are not directly disclosed, the segment's increased prominence in derivative liabilities\u2014$23 million in current liabilities and $100 million in total net liabilities recognized\u2014suggests a relative increase in its operational complexity and regulatory exposure compared to other Southern Company segments. This indicates that Alabama Power's role likely expanded or became more financially significant within the company's structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Site Safety Programs were identified as a critical component of operational readiness for major construction projects like Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with risks including delays due to inadequate safety protocols. By 2024, the impact of Site Safety Programs had shifted to being a potential negative factor, as workforce challenges and contractor replacement costs were highlighted as contributors to rising safety-related expenses and operational risks. This evolution indicates that while safety remained a priority, its implementation became a source of financial and scheduling pressure over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Site Safety Programs were a dependency for operational readiness and were tied to the successful completion of high-profile nuclear projects, with risks including delays due to non-compliance or inadequate planning.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Site Safety Programs were linked to increased costs and operational risks due to workforce turnover, contractor replacement, and broader labor market challenges.",
        "Step 3: The relationship evolved from being a prerequisite for project success to a potential source of financial and scheduling risk, indicating a transformation in how Site Safety Programs impacted Southern Company's strategic goals."

          "chunk_text": "## The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to continuing workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer in higher rates during recent years as compared to prior years and challenges competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully-remote work options. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. The Southern Company system is also subject to risks associated with the failure to adequately manage contract resources. In addition, the failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the Southern Company system's ability to manage and operate its business.\n\n## Supply chain disruptions, inflation, elevated interest rates, tariffs, and other economic factors could negatively impact operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment, materials, and other resources. The delivery of components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern Company system's operations has been impacted by domestic and global supply chain disruptions. Future pandemic health events or continued international tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflicts and any strained relationships between the United States and other countries related to such conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the impact of tariffs, could further ex acerbate global supply chain disruptions. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction, maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments.\n\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment, and other needed commodities, and these inflationary increases may continue. Further inflation, a continued elevated interest rate environment, tariffs, or other economic factors may negatively affect operations and the timely recovery of costs.\n\n## CONSTRUCTION RISKS\n\nThe Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recov er their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing expenditures, including those to maintain reliability and meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.\n\nThe businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements, including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for Southern Company Gas, to, among other things, maintain reliability. These ex penditures also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to certain existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system and is involved in new gas pipeline construction projects. The traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing surface impoundments to comply with the CCR Rule and, where applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, ex panding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to maintain reliability and to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed.\n\nCompletion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; potential impact of newlylevied tariffs; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational performance; challenges related to pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological conditions; delays or increased costs to",

      "question": "How did the impact of the cost of natural gas on SO's financial derivatives position evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about changing market conditions or risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - The cost of natural gas resulted in a $27 million loss in derivatives.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in 2021, reflecting a 24.4% increase compared to 2020, driven by higher fuel costs and energy purchase volumes. Specifically, natural gas prices rose by 35.7%, and a new PPA in September 2020 contributed to a 19.4% increase in energy purchased. By 2024, the company faced new demand dynamics, particularly from data centers and advanced manufacturing industries, leading to projected demand that exceeded historical levels. This shift created a need for new generation and transmission infrastructure, with the risk that regulators may not allow timely cost recovery, potentially exposing the company to regulatory lag and financial risk. The nature of demand evolved from being primarily driven by traditional economic and seasonal factors to being significantly influenced by new, less predictable industries, increasing the complexity of capacity planning and cost recovery.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, fuel and purchased power expenses were rising due to higher natural gas prices and new PPAs, with a total expense of $1.6 billion in 2021 and a 24.4% year-over-year increase.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the company identified a shift in demand drivers, with data centers and advanced manufacturing industries creating new demand that exceeded historical patterns, requiring significant new infrastructure investment.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from cost-driven expense increases in 2022 to demand-driven planning risks in 2024 reflects a strategic and operational shift in how Southern Company must manage energy demand and cost recovery."

See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.\n\nFuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $314 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate ECR\" for additional information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense was $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $265 million, or 27.3%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 35.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 25.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an 8.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 6.7% decrease in the average cost of nuclear fuel per KWH generated and a 3.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\n## Purchased Power -Non-Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $221 million in 2021, an increase of $30 million, or 15.7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 19.4% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to a new PPA that began in September 2020 and a 10.6% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices.\n\nEnergy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Purchased Power -Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from affiliates was $147 million in 2021, an increase of $19 million, or 14.8%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an 87.4% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 38.8% decrease in the volume of KWH purchased as Alabama Power's units generally dispatched at a lower cost than other available Southern Company system resources.",

In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.\n\n## A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.\n\nThere are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company noted that distributed generation technologies, such as smaller-scale and more fuel-efficient systems, posed a risk of reducing demand for centralized energy as customers increasingly opted for self-generation. By 2024, the narrative shifted to emphasize rising overall demand, particularly driven by new industries such as data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing, suggesting that while distributed generation remains a factor, it is being overshadowed by new large-scale energy demands. This indicates a shift from concern over demand erosion due to customer self-generation to a focus on managing increased system load and infrastructure investment needs.",

        "In 2022, the company expressed concern that distributed generation could reduce demand for energy from centralized providers due to customer self-generation and regulatory shifts.",
        "In 2024, the company reported that demand projections now exceed recent levels, driven by data centers and advanced manufacturing, requiring new generation and transmission infrastructure.",

Broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, a state PSC or legislature may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' business as a result of these advances in technology, which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation.\n\nIt is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Southern Company Gas competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., where the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located.\n\nIf new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution and storage facilities could be reduced. Additionally, these technology and customer-induced changes to the electric generation business models could change the risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.\n\n## The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with major construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer at higher rates as compared to prior years. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Southern Company and its subsidiaries' ability to manage and operate their businesses.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, disruption to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 for Southern Company and Georgia Power.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most jurisdictions, including in the United States, initially instituted restrictions on travel, public gatherings, and non-essential business operations. While some jurisdictions, including some in the Southern Company system's service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, some remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be reimposed in the future. These restrictions, as well as changes in individual behavior in response to the pandemic, have significantly disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020 and 2021 and could continue to do so in the future. The Registrants cannot predict the extent or duration of the pandemic, the impact of new variants of COVID-19, the timing, availability, distribution, or effectiveness of vaccines, anti-virals, or other treatments or preventions for COVID-19, governmental responsive measures, including vaccine mandates, or the extent of the effects or impacts on the global, national, or local economy, the capital markets, or the Subsidiary Registrants' customers, suppliers, or operations.\n\nThe effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include new or extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and new or prolonged reductions in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, new or prolonged reductions in demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, further increases in costs of necessary equipment, and further challenges to the development, construction, and/or operation of the Registrants' facilities, including electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets, the performance of necessary corporate and customer service functions, and access to funds from financial institutions and capital markets.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could further disrupt or delay construction, testing, supervisory, and support activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" in Item 8 herein.",

Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

      "answer": "In 2022, the 'Cost of Other Sales' was reported at $109 million, with a year-over-year increase of $15 million from 2020, indicating a relatively minor upward trend. However, by 2024, this cost category had evolved into a more significant factor, as noted in the consolidated results of operations, where it was explicitly listed among the key cost drivers that 'negatively impacted' net income. This shift shows that while the cost was modestly rising in 2022, it had become a more pronounced financial burden by 2024.",

Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

By 2024, this metric had further increased, contributing to a rise in total operating expenses, as noted in Southern Company's 2024 results. The increase in Cost of Other Sales was influenced by capital investments in infrastructure and technology, particularly in Atlanta Gas Light's Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan and Virginia Natural Gas' SAVE program, which together added significant project-related expenditures. Additionally, the surcharge recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC and the base rate increases sought by Virginia Natural Gas were implemented to offset these rising costs, indicating a direct link between operational spending and the evolution of the Cost of Other Sales.",

See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares primarily related to stock-based compensation, was $3.99 in 2024 and $3.62 in 2023. EPS for 2024 and 2023 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.06 per",

      "answer": "In 2022 (reporting 2021 data), the Cost of Other Sales increased by $15 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects at Georgia Power, but it did not have a significant negative impact on net income. By 2024, however, the Cost of Other Sales was explicitly cited as a factor that negatively impacted consolidated net income, contributing to increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.\n\nIn 2021, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 32.4%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily the result of a $1.1 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $170 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.\n\n## Fuel\n\nIn 2021, fuel expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 35.2%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 51.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 25.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 12.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 4.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\n## Purchased Power\n\nIn 2021, purchased power expense was $978 million, an increase of $179 million, or 22.4%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 25.8% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas prices.\n\nEnergy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Cost of Other Sales\n\nCost of other sales increased $15 million, or 16.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects at Georgia Power.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $559 million, or 13.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily associated with increases of $174 million in transmission and distribution expenses, including $37 million of reliability NDR credits applied in 2020 at Alabama",

Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which included annual base rate increases of $72 million, $73 million, and $74 million effective January 1, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Virginia Commission approved the extension of the existing SAVE program through 2029. The extension of the program includes investments of $70 million in each year from 2025 through 2029, with a potential variance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a max imum total investment over the five-year extension (2025 through 2029) of $355 million.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approx imately 8.9 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and ex ecution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance.\n\nThe financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate RSE\" and \"Mississippi Power - Performance Evaluation Plan\" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company Gas\" herein for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics.\n\nSouthern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Southern Company\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $425 million, or 10.7%, from 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing and weather impacts, an increase in natural gas revenues associated with rate increases, an increase in other revenues, and an increase in other electric revenues, partially offset by increases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and cost of other sales.\n\nBasic EPS was $4.02 in 2024 and $3.64 in 2023.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company identified specialized operator training as a critical component of operational readiness for major construction projects like Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with risks tied to delays and cost overruns if readiness was not achieved. By 2024, the emphasis on operator training remained, but it was now explicitly linked to broader workforce challenges, including labor shortages, increased contractor costs, and knowledge transfer issues. This evolution indicates that while training remained a key concern, its context expanded to include systemic workforce pressures that could negatively impact construction timelines and budgets.",

          "chunk_text": "## The Subsidiary Registrants are subject to workforce factors that could affect operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system must attract, train, and retain a workforce to meet current and future needs. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, increased cost or reduced supply of labor, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including workforce needs associated with construction projects and ongoing operations. The Southern Company system may be subject to continuing workforce trends occurring in the United States triggered by decisions of employees to leave the workforce and/or their employer in higher rates during recent years as compared to prior years and challenges competing with other employers offering more flexible or fully-remote work options. The Southern Company system's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. The Southern Company system is also subject to risks associated with the failure to adequately manage contract resources. In addition, the failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the Southern Company system's ability to manage and operate its business.\n\n## Supply chain disruptions, inflation, elevated interest rates, tariffs, and other economic factors could negatively impact operations.\n\nThe Southern Company system's operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment, materials, and other resources. The delivery of components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern Company system's operations has been impacted by domestic and global supply chain disruptions. Future pandemic health events or continued international tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflicts and any strained relationships between the United States and other countries related to such conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the impact of tariffs, could further ex acerbate global supply chain disruptions. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction, maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments.\n\nSupply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment, and other needed commodities, and these inflationary increases may continue. Further inflation, a continued elevated interest rate environment, tariffs, or other economic factors may negatively affect operations and the timely recovery of costs.\n\n## CONSTRUCTION RISKS\n\nThe Registrants have incurred and may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to recov er their investments. Also, existing facilities of the Subsidiary Registrants require ongoing expenditures, including those to maintain reliability and meet AROs and other environmental standards and goals.\n\nThe businesses of the Registrants require substantial expenditures for investments in new facilities as well as capital improvements, including transmission, distribution, and generation facilities for the traditional electric operating companies, generation facilities for Southern Power, and capital improvements to natural gas distribution facilities for Southern Company Gas, to, among other things, maintain reliability. These ex penditures also include those to settle AROs and meet environmental standards and goals. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and/or adding environmental and other modifications to certain existing generating facilities and Southern Company Gas is replacing certain pipe in its natural gas distribution system and is involved in new gas pipeline construction projects. The traditional electric operating companies also are in the process of closing surface impoundments to comply with the CCR Rule and, where applicable, state CCR rules. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, ex panding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to maintain reliability and to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These projects are long term in nature and in some cases may include the development and construction of facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed.\n\nCompletion of these types of projects without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks that have occurred or may occur, including labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with the management of contractors or vendors; subcontractor performance; adverse weather conditions; shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; the impacts of inflation; potential impact of newlylevied tariffs; delays due to judicial or regulatory action; nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto; design and other licensing-based compliance matters; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration; and/or operational performance; challenges related to pandemic health events; continued public and policymaker support for projects; environmental and geological conditions; delays or increased costs to",

These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, government incentives to reduce overall energy usage, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.\n\nMississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.\n\nAs part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.\n\nAlabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nSouthern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.",

Also see Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nThe level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital ex penditures, including ex panding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the United States for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.\n\nEarnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; demand growth in data centers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.\n\nMississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 13.9% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff\" for information on a rate settlement related to Mississippi Power's contract with Cooperative Energy through the end of 2035, subject to approval by the FERC.\n\nAs part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Southern Company reported that the average cost of fuel generated and purchased contributed to a $1.1 billion increase in total fuel and purchased power expenses in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily driven by higher natural gas prices, which led to a 51.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. In contrast, by 2024, the company experienced a $244 million decrease in expenses related to the average cost of fuel generated and purchased, with a 9.0% decrease in the average cost of coal and a 5.4% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. This reflects a significant shift from rising fuel costs in 2022 to cost reductions in 2024, particularly for fossil fuels. Additionally, in 2024, a $55 million credit to nuclear fuel expense also contributed to lowering overall fuel costs. The evolution indicates a strategic and market-driven shift in fuel cost dynamics over the period.",

By 2024, the focus shifted to the uncertainty in demand for energy, particularly driven by new industries such as data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing. This evolving demand created the need for new power generation and transmission infrastructure, with potential risks around cost recovery and regulatory lag. Unlike in 2022, where fuel prices directly impacted revenues (with corresponding cost impacts), the 2024 analysis highlights strategic and regulatory risks tied to demand projections.",

In addition, Southern Company, Southern Company Gas, and Southern Power may provide capital contributions or debt financing to subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet their respective financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Southern Company's common stock.\n\n## A downgrade in the credit ratings of any of the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas could negatively affect their ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or could require posting of collateral or replacing certain indebtedness.\n\nThere are numerous factors that rating agencies evaluate to determine credit ratings for the Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, other commitments for capital, and certain other controllable and uncontrollable events. The Registrants, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or the applicable company has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If any rating agency downgrades any Registrant, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including potential automatic increases in interest rates or fees under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrade could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness (which would rank senior to unsecured indebtedness) and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace ex isting PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally ex pected.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers, as well as wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet obligations could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the",

      "question": "How has the risk associated with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for Southern Power evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding the ability to replace or extend PPAs upon expiration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power faced uncertainty in executing its business plan if market prices dropped below original forecasts and risked being unable to fully recover costs if it could not extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, potentially having to market assets at lower-than-intended prices. By 2024, the risk remained but evolved with additional emphasis on the new and uncertain demand from data centers and advanced manufacturing industries, which introduced further capital spending needs and uncertainty around the actual capacity required to meet these emerging demands. This evolution reflects a shift from general market price risk to a more complex scenario involving both market pricing and demand-side unpredictability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Southern Power's PPA risk centered on market price drops below forecasted levels, which could prevent full cost recovery if PPAs could not be extended or replaced, forcing lower-than-expected pricing.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the risk expanded to include uncertainty around new demand sources\u2014specifically data centers and advanced manufacturing\u2014which introduced new capital needs and uncertainty about required generation capacity.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution from a primarily price-based risk environment to one that includes both pricing and demand-side complexity, increasing the overall risk profile associated with PPAs."

Any credit rating downgrades could require altering the mix of debt financing currently used and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants binding the applicable company.\n\n## Uncertainty in demand for energy can result in lower earnings or higher costs.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power each engage in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets required to serve future load obligations. Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines and storage facilities, replacing existing pipelines, rewatering storage facilities, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution and storage facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, customer technology adoption, and the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in customers' rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts. Southern Power and/or the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to extend or replace existing PPAs upon expiration, or they may be forced to market these assets at prices lower than originally intended.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are currently obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. Southern Power is currently obligated to supply power to wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed the Southern Company system's available generation capacity. Market or competitive forces may require that the traditional electric operating companies purchase capacity in the open market or build additional generation and transmission facilities and that Southern Power purchase energy or capacity in the open market. Because regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs on to their customers, the traditional electric operating companies may not be able to recover some or all of these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional electric operating companies' recovery in customers' rates. Under Southern Power's long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power may not be able to recover all of these costs.\n\n## The businesses of the Registrants and Nicor Gas are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital through capital markets and financial institutions.\n\nThe Registrants and Nicor Gas rely on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity to meet capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If any of the Registrants or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited due to weakened capacity to fund capital investments or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.

Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates.

Southern Company Gas engages in a long-term planning process to estimate the optimal mix and timing of building new pipelines, replacing existing pipelines, and entering new markets and/or expanding in existing markets. These planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities and natural gas distribution facilities. Inherent risk ex ists in predicting demand as future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including economic conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies are experiencing projected demand that exceeds recent experience, creating the need for new power generating resources and transmission facilities. The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies.\n\nBecause regulators may not permit the traditional electric operating companies or the natural gas distribution utilities to adjust rates to recover the costs of new generation and associated transmission assets and/or new pipelines and related infrastructure in a timely manner or at all, these subsidiaries may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs and the recovery in regulated rates. In addition, under Southern Power's model of selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original forecasts.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power faced the risk that if market prices dropped below original forecasts, it might not be able to fully execute its business plan under long-term PPAs. By 2024, this risk persisted, but the context evolved with new demand drivers such as data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing increasing projected power needs. However, uncertainty remained around whether incremental revenues from these new industries would cover the incremental costs and risks associated with meeting this demand, suggesting a continuation of PPA-related exposure but under a shifting demand landscape.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Southern Power's business model relied on selling capacity and energy under long-term PPAs at market-based rates, with a risk that market price drops could prevent full execution of its business plan.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Southern Power remained subject to long-term PPAs, but the underlying demand projections changed significantly with new industries like data centers and EV manufacturing driving increased load forecasts.",
        "Step 3: The exposure to PPAs remained a strategic risk, but the nature of the risk evolved from general market price sensitivity to a more complex scenario involving new demand uncertainties tied to emerging sectors."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company had transitioned its electric generating mix from 70% coal in 2007 to 22% coal by 2021, contributing to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. By 2024, the company had achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 49% from 2007 levels, nearly reaching its intermediate goal of a 50% reduction by 2030. This progress was driven by retiring coal-fired capacity, converting to natural gas, expanding renewable energy resources, and the addition of lower-carbon generation from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The emissions remained flat in 2024 compared to 2023 despite increased electric generation, indicating improved efficiency and cleaner generation mix.",

The ultimate impact of the EPA's announced positions on the traditional electric operating companies cannot be determined at this time, but may be material.\n\nBased on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY \"Cash Requirements,\" Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans,\" and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Environmental Remediation\" for additional information.\n\n## Global Climate Issues\n\nIn 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which would have required states to develop unitspecific CO  emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule back to the EPA. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for writs of certiorari asking the court to review the District of Columbia Circuit's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court's review will focus on the extent of the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from the power sector under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. 2\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. On April 22, 2021 President Biden announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement.\n\nAdditional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 48% natural gas in 2021. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015, as well as constructing and/or acquiring over 11,000 MWs of renewable resource capacity since 2010. See \"Environmental Laws and Regulations - Water Quality\" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO  equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998. 2",

S ee Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\nSouthern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2024 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 49% since 2007. Although electric generation increased, GHG emissions remained flat in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to an increase in lower carbon generation, including from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed further under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - \"Southern Company - Electricity Business\" herein. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. The natural gas distribution utilities also engage in long-term planning processes in accordance with their state regulatory processes and are investing in programs and efforts to reduce GHG emissions associated with the delivery and use of natural gas, such as advanced leak detection and repair and renewable natural gas. Achievement of these goals is dependent on various factors, many of which the Southern Company system does not control, including load growth across the Southern Company system's service territory, energy policy and regulations, natural gas prices, and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to economically transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet through a diverse portfolio of resources including low-carbon and carbon-free resources; making the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continuing to implement effective energy efficiency and demand response programs; customer demand for carbon-free energy; implementing initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution emissions; continuing research and development with a focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engaging with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future. There is no guarantee that the Southern Company system will achieve these goals.\n\n## Environmental Remediation\n\nThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances.

      "answer": "In 2022, the annual base rate adjustment mechanism was explicitly applied to Chattanooga Gas and Atlanta Gas Light, with Chattanooga using it for pipeline replacement program cost recovery. By 2024, this mechanism evolved into a broader framework tied directly to the Authorized ROE or ROE range, allowing for annual adjustments to base rates based on performance relative to the authorized return. Additionally, in 2022, bad debt recovery was handled through a rider at Nicor Gas, while in 2024, the mechanism expanded to include both recovery and refund components based on a benchmark expense level. These changes indicate a shift toward more dynamic and ROE-linked regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that it amortized changes in the market value of return-seeking plan assets over five years, while liability-hedging plan assets were recognized immediately. This approach was a continuation of a method change implemented in 2020, where the company shifted to using fair value for liability-hedging assets to better align with changes in related obligations. By 2024, the company reported specific amounts associated with unamortized net periodic pension costs from Southern Company Gas' pension plans prior to its acquisition, showing $21 million in 2022, $17 million in 2023, and $20 million in 2024. This indicates that while the amortization policy remained consistent, the actual financial impact of unamortized amounts fluctuated year to year, peaking in 2022 and declining slightly in 2023 before rising again in 2024.",

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs\n\nIn April 2020 and June 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections through July 14, 2020 and to defer the resulting incremental bad debt as a regulatory asset. In June 2020 and July 2020, the Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, the incremental costs deferred totaled approximately $38 million (including approximately $23 million of incremental bad debt costs and $15 million of other incremental costs). Since June 2021, Georgia Power has continued a review of bad debt amounts deferred under the Georgia PSC-approved methodology, including consideration of actual amounts repaid by customers from arrears and installment plans after the disconnection moratorium period ended. As a result, Georgia Power's incremental costs deferred at December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $21 million, including an immaterial amount of incremental bad debt costs. The period over which these costs will be recovered is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Fuel Cost Recovery\n\nGeorgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In May 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the second half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding $200 million. Therefore, on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates by 15%, or approximately $252 million annually, effective January 1, 2022. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200 million. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023.\n\nGeorgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $410 million at December 31, 2021 and is included in other deferred charges and assets on Southern Company's balance sheet and deferred under recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled $113 million and is included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheet and over recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheet.\n\nGeorgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.",

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Transmission Asset Sales\n\nOn March 7, 2024, the FERC approved the sale of transmission line assets under the integrated transmission system agreement, with a net book value of $236 million. On April 24, 2024, the sale, with a purchase price of $351 million, was completed resulting in a pre-tax  gain of approx imately $114 million ($84 million after tax ) recorded in the second quarter 2024.\n\n## Fuel Cost Recovery\n\nGeorgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. During 2022, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance increased significantly due to higher fuel and purchased power costs. In May 2023, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to increase annual fuel billings by 54%, or approximately $1.1 billion, effective June 1, 2023. The increase includes a three-year recovery period for $2.2 billion of Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance at May 31, 2023. Under the approved stipulation, Georgia Power is allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the nex t fuel case, subject to a max imum 40% cumulative change, if its under or over recovered fuel balance accumulated since May 31, 2023 exceeds $200 million. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its nex t fuel case no later than February 28, 2026.\n\nGeorgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2024, of which $713 million is included in under recovered fuel clause revenues and under recovered retail fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets, respectively, and $453 million is included in deferred under recovered retail fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. The under recovered fuel balance totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2023, of which $694 million is included in under recovered fuel clause revenues and under recovered retail fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets, respectively, and $1.2 billion is included in deferred under recovered retail fuel clause revenues on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets.\n\nGeorgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.\n\n## Storm Damage Recovery\n\nGeorgia Power defers and recovers certain costs related to damages from major storms as mandated by the Georgia PSC. During 2022, Georgia Power recovered $213 million annually under the 2019 ARP. Beginning January 1, 2023, Georgia Power is recovering $31 million annually under the 2022 ARP. At December 31, 2023, Georgia Power's regulatory asset balance related to storm damage was $54 million, of which $31 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $23 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. During September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane totaled approx imately $870 million, of which approximately $750 million was deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage, approximately $90 million was capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, and approximately $30 million was deferred to be billed in 2025 to open access transmission tariff customers. At December 31, 2024, Georgia Power's regulatory asset balance related to storm damage was $827 million, of which $31 million is included in other regulatory assets, current and $795 million is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's net income but do impact the related operating cash flows.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power's federal and state PTCs reduced income tax expense by $16 million in 2021, $15 million in 2020, and $12 million in 2019, indicating consistent utilization of these credits. By 2024, while the structure of tax benefits remained, the specific quantitative impact was not detailed, suggesting a shift in reporting emphasis or a potential change in the magnitude of tax credit benefits.

      "answer": "The annual expense for the dismantlement of other generation units at FPL increased from $48 million in 2022 to a level that reflects updated depreciation studies and regulatory filings in 2023. This change was based on the FPSC approval of a new annual expense in 2022, which was effective from January 1, 2022, and the ongoing periodic reviews and filings with regulatory bodies in 2023 that influence depreciation rates and expense recognition.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, FPL had an approved annual dismantlement expense of $48 million based on updated studies effective January 1, 2022.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, NEER's depreciation expense included provisions for dismantlement, and periodic depreciation studies were filed with FERC, which resulted in updated depreciation rates.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a systematic update in regulatory filings and depreciation studies, indicating a continuation and refinement of FPL\u2019s dismantlement cost recognition process under regulatory oversight."

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nAsset  Retirement  Obligations -  NEE  and  FPL  each  account  for  asset  retirement  obligations  and  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived  assets.  NEE's AROs  relate  primarily  to  decommissioning  obligations  of  FPL's  and  NEER's  nuclear  units  and  to  obligations  for  the dismantlement  of  certain  of  NEER's  wind  and  solar  facilities.  See  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\n\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using  a  systematic  and  rational  method  over  the  asset's  estimated  useful  life.  Changes  in  the ARO  resulting  from  the  passage  of  time  are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs - For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear and other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear  decommissioning  and  other  generation  dismantlement  studies  periodically  filed  with  the  FPSC.  In  addition,  FPL  accrues  for  interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\n\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively, and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $10.2 billion, or $2.4 billion expressed in 2021 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the application submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds,  which  are  included  in  special  use  funds  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Marketable  securities  held  in  the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2021, 2020 and 2019 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $173 million, $132 million and $125 million, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nOther  generation  plant  dismantlement  studies  are  performed  periodically  and  are  submitted  to  the  FPSC  for  approval.  Previously  approved studies were effective from January 1, 2017 through December 2021 and resulted in an annual expense of $26 million which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved a new annual expense of $48 million based on FPL's updated dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. At December  31,  2021,  FPL's  portion  of  the  ultimate  cost  to  dismantle  its  other  generation  units  is  approximately  $2.5  billion,  or  $1.2  billion expressed in 2021 dollars.\n\nNEER's AROs  primarily  include  nuclear  decommissioning  liabilities  for  Seabrook  Station  (Seabrook),  Duane  Arnold  Energy  Center  (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed a significant financial commitment to NEER with $4.4 billion allocated in the capital expenditure plan for that year. By 2023, NEER's capitalized development costs had increased to $1.5 billion from $1.0 billion in 2022, indicating a growing investment in project development. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward expanding NEER's project pipeline, as evidenced by the increase in capitalized development costs and ongoing construction activities tied to NEER's operations.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, NEE reported a capital expenditure of $4.4 billion for NEER, signaling a major investment in its operations.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in NEE's relationship with NEER, shifting from a focus on immediate capital spending to long-term project development and infrastructure growth."

      "answer": "In 2022, NEER had natural gas transportation agreements with commitments totaling approximately $400 million annually through 2028 and thereafter, primarily related to Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, LLC. By 2023, NEER entered into a new 20-year natural gas transportation agreement with Mountain Valley Pipeline, a joint venture in which NEER holds a 32.8% equity stake, with annual commitments of approximately $70 million. This indicates a strategic expansion in NEER\u2019s natural gas infrastructure commitments, adding a new long-term agreement while maintaining existing obligations. The total firm commitments in 2023 also included $1,065 million, $40 million, and $5 million for 2024 through 2026, respectively, under joint obligations with NEECH.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEECH's relationship with NEER involved a financial structure where interest expense was allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt, and NEE had delivered a five-year total shareholder return of approximately 251.8% as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the relationship shifted to NEE having a stake in NEECH, with the same 70% debt-based capital structure still in place for allocating interest expense. However, NEE's five-year total shareholder return had significantly decreased to 56.4% as of December 31, 2023, lagging behind broader market indices like the S&P 500, which returned 107.2% over the same period. This indicates a transformation in the strategic relationship between NEE and NEECH, accompanied by a notable decline in shareholder returns.",

By 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed a $2,986 million increase to net income compared to the prior year.

The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized.\n\n(b) See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests for a discussion of the sale of two solar generation facilities in Spain (Spain projects).\n\n(c) For 2019, approximately $44 million, $20 million and $6 million of costs are included in Corporate and Other's, Gulf Power's and NEER's net income, respectively.\n\n(d) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2020 related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).\n\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected  or  has  been  discontinued.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  those  transactions  are  marked  to  market  and  reported  in  the  consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the  non-qualifying  hedge  category  for  certain  energy  derivatives  is  offset  by  decreases  (increases)  in  the  fair  value  of  related  physical  asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities,  which  is  included  in  adjusted  earnings,  represents  the  net  unrealized  effect  of  actively  traded  positions  entered  into  to  take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\n## 2021 Summary\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2021 was higher than 2020 by $654 million, or $0.33 per share, assuming dilution, due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power.\n\nFPL's net income increased by $316 million in 2021 primarily reflecting higher results at the FPL segment and at Gulf Power. The FPL segment's increase in net income for 2021 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property. Gulf Power's increase in net income in 2021 was primarily driven by reductions in O&amp;M expenses.",

By 2023, the language evolved to indicate that such retrospective assessments not only remained a risk but were now described as having the potential to 'negatively impact' NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, and prospects, signaling a shift in tone toward a more direct and immediate risk characterization.

If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL  could  be  assessed  significant  retrospective  assessments  and/or  retrospective  insurance  premiums  as  a  result  of  their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.\n\nLiability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance  coverage  for  an  incident  at  any  nuclear  reactor  in  the  U.S.  Under  the  secondary  financial  protection  system,  NEE  is  subject  to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority  to  impose  licensing  and  safety-related  requirements  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  nuclear  generation facilities,  the  addition  of  capacity  at  existing  nuclear  generation  facilities  and  the  construction  of  new  nuclear  generation  facilities,  and  these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility,  depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Any of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.\n\nAny serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility. An incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the  industry,  or  on  certain  types  of  nuclear  generation  units,  which  could  increase  costs,  reduce  revenues  and  result  in  additional  capital expenditures.\n\nThe inability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NEE and FPL.\n\nNEE  and  FPL  rely  on  access  to  capital  and  credit  markets  as  significant  sources  of  liquidity  for  capital  requirements  and  other  operations requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets, including, but not  limited  to,  the  planned  phase  out  of  the  London  Inter-Bank  Offered  Rate  or  the  reform  or  replacement  of  other  benchmark  rates,  could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or  FPL is  unable  to  access  regularly  the  capital  and  credit  markets  on  terms  that  are  reasonable,  it  may  have  to  delay  raising  capital,  issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "answer": "In 2022, fund earnings from NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds, including dividends, interest, and realized gains and losses, were recognized in income and reinvested in the funds. Market adjustments for equity securities were recorded in 'change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds - net' in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In 2023, FPL's fund earnings, which included dividends, interest, and realized gains and losses, were reinvested in the funds but were no longer recognized in income. Instead, these earnings and any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities were reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. This represents a shift from direct income recognition to a regulatory accounting treatment.",

The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 11. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEER's ARO was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and was primarily determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs  associated  with  spent  fuel  storage  above  what  is  expected  to  be  refunded  by  the  DOE  under  a  spent  fuel  settlement  agreement,  is estimated  to  be  approximately  $9.4  billion,  or  $2.1  billion  expressed  in  2021  dollars.  The  ultimate  cost  to  dismantle  NEER's  wind  and  solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nSeabrook  files  a  comprehensive  nuclear  decommissioning  study  with  the  New  Hampshire  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Financing  Committee (NDFC) every four years; the most recent study was filed in 2019. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently, there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach, however, the NRC, and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's  and  Point  Beach's  restricted  funds  for  the  payment  of  future  expenditures  to  decommission  these  plants  is  included  in  nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning  funds  are  primarily  carried  at  fair  value.  See  Note  4.  Market  adjustments  for  debt  securities  result  in  a  corresponding adjustment  to  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI),  except  for  estimated  credit  losses  and  unrealized  losses  on  debt  securities  intended  or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Market  adjustments  for  equity  securities  are  recorded  in  change  in  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  equity  securities  held  in  NEER's  nuclear decommissioning funds - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nMajor Maintenance Costs - FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL  recognizes  costs  associated  with  planned  major  nuclear  maintenance  in  accordance  with  regulatory  treatment.  FPL  defers  nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nNEER uses  the  deferral  method  to  account  for  certain  planned  major  maintenance  costs.  NEER's  major  maintenance  costs  for  its  nuclear generation  units  and  combustion  turbines  are  capitalized  (included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  on  NEE's  consolidated  balance  sheets)  and amortized to O&amp;M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\nRestricted Cash - At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEE had approximately $677 million ($53 million for FPL) and $441 million ($135 million for FPL),  respectively,  of  restricted  cash,  of  which  approximately  $677  million  ($53  million  for  FPL)  and  $374  million  ($93  million  for  FPL), respectively,  are  included  in  current  other  assets  and  the  remaining  balances  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  on  NEE's  and  FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $121 million is netted against derivative assets and $172 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2021 and $183 million is netted against derivative assets and $136 million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2020. See Note 3.\n\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments - Effective January 1, 2020, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides for a new methodology, the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, to account for credit losses for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost. On January 1, 2020, NEE recorded a reduction to retained earnings of approximately $11 million representing the cumulative effect of adopting the new standards update, which primarily related to the impact of applying the CECL model to NEER's receivables. The impact of adopting the new standards update was not material to FPL. See also Note 4 - Special Use Funds.\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Bad Debt - FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated  using  a  percentage,  derived  from  historical  revenue  and  write-off  trends,  of  the  previous  four  months  of  revenue,  and  includes estimates of  credit  and  other  losses  based  on  both  current  events  and  forecasts.  NEER  regularly  reviews  collectibility  of  its  receivables  and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its retail electricity  provider  operations,  as  well  as  includes  estimates  for  credit  and  other  losses  based  on  both  current  events  and  forecasts.  When necessary, NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "question": "How has the relationship between NEE and NEER evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of NEE's involvement and stake in NEER's operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE directly disclosed NEER's capital expenditures, showing a total of $8,363 million invested in various energy assets including wind, solar, and battery storage. By 2023, the relationship evolved as NEE is now described as 'having a stake in' NEER, which suggests a shift from direct operational involvement to a more strategic or financial stake. This is further supported by the 2023 filing's focus on legal proceedings involving NEE directly, while NEER's operations are no longer detailed with specific financial figures, indicating a reduced direct operational role of NEE in NEER.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, NEE directly disclosed NEER's capital expenditures, including specific figures for wind ($3,777 million), solar ($2,011 million), and battery storage ($304 million), indicating direct involvement in NEER's operations.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the relationship is described as NEE 'having a stake in' NEER, with no specific financial details provided about NEER\u2019s operations, and instead, the focus shifts to legal proceedings involving NEE directly.",
        "Step 3: The change from direct disclosure of NEER's financials in 2022 to a more generalized 'stake in' NEER in 2023 indicates a transformation in the nature of NEE\u2019s involvement, likely signaling a strategic shift in how NEE engages with NEER."

      "question": "How has NEE's reliance on proceeds from differential membership investors evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this suggest about its broader financing strategy in relation to long-term debt issuances and equity issuances during the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE received $4,158 million in proceeds from differential membership investors, which decreased to $2,745 million in 2023. This decline coincided with a significant increase in equity issuances, which rose from $1,460 million in 2022 to $4,514 million in 2023, while long-term debt issuances remained relatively stable at around $13.85 billion in both years. This suggests that NEE shifted its financing mix from greater reliance on differential membership proceeds toward more equity financing in 2023, maintaining debt levels while reducing dependence on specialized investor contributions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, proceeds from differential membership investors were $4,158 million, with long-term debt issuance at $13,856 million and equity issuances at $1,460 million.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, proceeds from differential membership investors dropped to $2,745 million, long-term debt issuance remained nearly unchanged at $13,857 million, and equity issuances more than tripled to $4,514 million.",
        "Step 3: The decrease in proceeds from differential membership investors and the corresponding increase in equity issuances indicate a strategic shift in NEE's capital structure, favoring equity over specialized investor funding while maintaining consistent debt levels."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nNEER's results increased in 2021 primarily driven by the absence of an impairment charge related to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline occurring in 2020 and higher earnings on new investments, partly offset by unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2020 and the absence of the 2020 gain on the sale of the Spain projects. In 2021, NEER added approximately 2,008 MW of new wind generating capacity and 728  MW  of  solar  generating  capacity,  repowered  435  MW  of  wind  generating  capacity  and  increased  its  backlog  of  contracted  renewable development projects.\n\nCorporate and Other's results in 2021 increased primarily due to favorable non-qualifying hedge activity.\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt, proceeds from differential membership investors, sales of assets to NEP or third parties and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2021 was $3.57 billion compared to $2.92 billion in 2020. In 2021, net income attributable to NEE increased primarily due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn February 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale of its ownership interest in two solar generation facilities located in Spain with a total generating capacity of 99.8 MW. In December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources sold a 90% noncontrolling ownership interest in a portfolio of three wind generation facilities and four solar generation facilities representing a total net generating capacity of  900  MW. Additionally  in  December 2020, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources sold its 100% ownership interest in a 100 MW solar generation  facility  and  a  30  MW  battery  storage  facility  under  construction,  which  achieved  commercial  operations  in  June  2021,  to  a  NEP subsidiary. In October 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources completed the sale to a NEP subsidiary of their 100% ownership interests in three wind generation facilities and one solar generation facility with a total generating capacity of 467 MW and 33.3% of the noncontrolling ownership interests in four solar generation facilities and multiple distributed generation solar facilities representing a total net generating capacity of  122  MW.  In  December  2021,  subsidiaries  of  NextEra  Energy  Resources  sold  their  100%  ownership  interest  in  a  portfolio  of  seven  wind generation  facilities  and  six  solar  generation  facilities  representing  a  total  generating  capacity  of  2,520  MW  and  115  MW  of  battery  storage capacity,  three  of  which  are  currently  under  construction  with  expected  in-service  dates  in  the  first  half  of  2022.  See  Note  1  -  Disposal  of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests.\n\nIn  March  2021,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  NEET  acquired  GridLiance  Holdco,  LP  and  GridLiance  GP,  LLC  (GridLiance),  which  owns  and operates three FERC-regulated transmission utilities across six states, five in the Midwest and Nevada. See Note 6 - GridLiance.\n\nNEE's effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 11% and 2%, respectively. The rates for both years reflect the impact of PTCs and ITCs and, in 2020, also reflect the impact of lower pretax income and the gain on sale of the Spain solar projects which was not taxable for federal nor state income tax purposes. See Note 5.\n\nOn January  1,  2021,  FPL  and  Gulf  Power  Company  merged,  with  FPL  as  the  surviving  entity.  However,  during  2021,  FPL  continued  to  be regulated as two separate ratemaking entities in the former service areas of FPL and Gulf Power. The FPL segment and Gulf Power continued to be separate operating segments of NEE, as well as FPL, through 2021. See Note 6 - Merger of FPL and Gulf Power Company. Effective January 1, 2022, FPL became regulated as one ratemaking entity with new unified rates and tariffs, and also became one operating segment of NEE. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025.",

By 2023, the relationship shifted from ownership to operation, with the next scheduled refueling outage moved to March 2025. This indicates a strategic evolution from a stakeholder to an operational role, with a notable shift in the timing of the refueling outage.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Retail Base\n\nThe FPL segment's retail base revenues for 2021 and 2020 reflect the 2016 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving  the  2016  rate  agreement  which  became  effective  in  January  2017  and  remained  in  effect  until  December  2021.  The  2016  rate agreement established the FPL segment's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.\n\nRetail base revenues decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and were impacted by a decrease of 2.6% in the average usage per retail customer, primarily related to unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year, partly offset by an increase of 1.5% in the average number of customer accounts. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n## Cost Recovery Clauses\n\nRevenues  from  fuel  and  other  cost  recovery  clauses  and  pass-through  costs,  such  as  franchise  fees,  revenue  taxes  and  storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery  clauses  on  certain  assets,  primarily  related  to  certain  solar,  environmental  projects,  storm  protection  plan  investments  and  the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with the FPL segment's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2021 net underrecovery impacting the FPL segment's operating cash flows was approximately $516 million, primarily related to the fuel cost recovery clause.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues increased approximately $775 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher fuel and energy prices. In 2021 and 2020, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $124 million and $111 million, respectively, to the FPL segment's net income. FPL's fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses are expected to increase in 2022 as a result of the collection of underrecovered 2021 fuel costs and higher projected natural gas prices in 2022.\n\n## Other Items Impacting the FPL Segment's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $807 million in 2021 primarily related to higher fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of the FPL segment's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nNEER's interest expense for 2021 decreased approximately $292 million primarily reflecting $251 million of favorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\n\nNEER recognized $666 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2021 compared to $1,351 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the prior year. The change for 2021 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in 2020 and higher equity in earnings of NEP recorded in 2021 primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Due to continued legal and regulatory challenges related to Mountain Valley Pipeline, NextEra Energy Resources also recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses\n\nPTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Reflected in income taxes in NEE's consolidated statements of income are PTCs totaling approximately $90 million and $150 million and ITCs totaling approximately $237 million and $133 million in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  A  portion  of  the  PTCs  and  ITCs  have  been  allocated  to  investors  in  connection  with  sales  of  differential membership interests. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of PTCs and ITCs and Note 5.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other at NEE is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated  based  on  a  deemed  capital  structure  of  70%  debt  and  differential  membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $268 million during 2021 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $370 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. The favorable non-qualifying hedge activity was partly offset by higher interest and refinancing costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and  sales  of  assets  to  NEP  or  third  parties  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interest), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn  October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests  in  NEP.  Under  the  program,  purchases  may  be  made  in  amounts,  at  prices  and  at  such  times  as  NEE  or  its  subsidiaries  deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated  by  NEE  at  any  time.  The  purpose  of  the  program  is  not  to  cause  NEP's  common  units  to  be  delisted  from  the  New  York  Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2021, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 55.0% of NEP's voting power.",

By 2023, the relationship shifted to 'Operates_In,' with the operating license expiration date significantly moved up to 2032, and the next scheduled refueling outage pushed to October 2024. This indicates a transformation in the company's involvement and a notable reduction in the long-term licensing horizon for the facility.",

      "question": "How has the financial exposure related to retrospective insurance premiums for nuclear incidents changed between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about NEE's risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE was subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. By 2023, the framing of this exposure shifted to emphasize that such retrospective insurance premiums could 'materially adversely affect' NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. This indicates that while the underlying risk remained, its potential financial impact was more explicitly highlighted in 2023, signaling a more pronounced concern in the company's risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, NEE was exposed to retrospective insurance premiums for nuclear incidents in the U.S. and certain European facilities, with the risk described in procedural and structural terms.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the description of the same risk emphasized the material adverse impact such premiums could have on NEE's and FPL's financial condition and operations.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a structural description in 2022 to a more impact-focused warning in 2023 indicates a transformation in how the company communicates the severity of this financial risk, suggesting a heightened concern or evolution in risk perception."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nand the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL  could  be  assessed  significant  retrospective  assessments  and/or  retrospective  insurance  premiums  as  a  result  of  their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.\n\nLiability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance  coverage  for  an  incident  at  any  nuclear  reactor  in  the  U.S.  Under  the  secondary  financial  protection  system,  NEE  is  subject  to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority  to  impose  licensing  and  safety-related  requirements  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  nuclear  generation facilities,  the  addition  of  capacity  at  existing  nuclear  generation  facilities  and  the  construction  of  new  nuclear  generation  facilities,  and  these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility,  depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Any of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.\n\nAny serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility. An incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the  industry,  or  on  certain  types  of  nuclear  generation  units,  which  could  increase  costs,  reduce  revenues  and  result  in  additional  capital expenditures.\n\nThe inability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NEE and FPL.\n\nNEE  and  FPL  rely  on  access  to  capital  and  credit  markets  as  significant  sources  of  liquidity  for  capital  requirements  and  other  operations requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets, including, but not  limited  to,  the  planned  phase  out  of  the  London  Inter-Bank  Offered  Rate  or  the  reform  or  replacement  of  other  benchmark  rates,  could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or  FPL is  unable  to  access  regularly  the  capital  and  credit  markets  on  terms  that  are  reasonable,  it  may  have  to  delay  raising  capital,  issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of",

      "question": "How did NEE's potential retrospective assessments related to nuclear incidents change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this evolution indicate about its exposure to nuclear risk liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NEE was subject to retrospective assessments of up to $963 million ($550 million for FPL), plus taxes, per incident under the secondary financial protection system, with payments capped at $143 million ($82 million for FPL) per incident per year. In 2023, the disclosures indicate a broader exposure, noting that NEE could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums not only for incidents at any U.S. nuclear reactor but also at certain nuclear facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity. This indicates an expanded scope of liability risk for NEE, even though the specific dollar amounts were not updated in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, NEE disclosed specific retrospective assessment limits of $963 million per incident and an annual payment cap of $143 million under the U.S.-based secondary financial protection system.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, NEE expanded its disclosure to include potential retrospective assessments not only for U.S. nuclear incidents but also for certain nuclear incidents in Europe, indicating a broader geographic exposure.",
        "Step 3: Although the exact dollar figures from 2022 were not repeated in 2023, the inclusion of European nuclear incidents in the risk profile signals an evolution in the scope of NEE\u2019s potential liabilities, suggesting increased exposure to international nuclear events."

The  charges  associated  with  these  agreements  are  recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $419 million, $386 million and $316 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $105 million, $108 million and $108 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.\n\n(b) Excludes commitments related to equity contributions and a 20-year natural gas transportation agreement (approximately $70 million per year) with a joint venture, in which NEER has a 31.9% equity investment, that is constructing a natural gas pipeline. These commitments are subject to the completion of construction of the pipeline which has a very low probability of completion. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements .\n\n(c) Includes approximately $370 million of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 9 - Other.\n\n(d) Includes approximately $610 million, $20 million, $5 million, $5 million, $0 million and $5 million for 2022 through 2026 and thereafter, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.\n\nInsurance -  Liability  for  accidents  at  nuclear  power  plants  is  governed  by  the  Price-Anderson Act,  which  limits  the  liability  of  nuclear  reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $450 million of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $100 million private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $13.1 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $963 million ($550 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $143 million ($82 million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $16 million and $20 million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\n\nNEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $2.75 billion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of $1.5 billion for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a limit of $50 million for property damage, decontamination risks and non-nuclear perils. NEE participates in co-insurance of 10% of the first $400 million of losses per site per occurrence, except at Duane Arnold. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $163 million ($104 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $2 million, $2 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\n\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's future storm restoration costs exceed the storm and property insurance reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  loss,  the  amount  of  insurance  available  might  not  be  adequate  to  cover  property  damage  and  other  expenses  incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\n## 16. Segment Information\n\nThe  tables  below  present  information  for  NEE's  and  FPL's  reportable  segments.  NEE's  segments  include  its  reportable  segments,  the  FPL segment, a rate-regulated utility business, and NEER, which is comprised of competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses, as well as an operating segment of NEE, Gulf Power, a rate-regulated utility business. FPL's reportable segments include the FPL segment and Gulf Power.  See  Note  6  -  Merger  of  FPL  and  Gulf  Power  Company.  Corporate  and  Other  for  each  of  NEE  and  FPL  represents  other  business activities,  such  as  purchase  accounting  adjustments for Gulf Power Company, includes eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nNEER's interest expense for 2021 decreased approximately $292 million primarily reflecting $251 million of favorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.\n\n## Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\n\nNEER recognized $666 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2021 compared to $1,351 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the prior year. The change for 2021 primarily reflects the absence of an impairment charge related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in 2020 and higher equity in earnings of NEP recorded in 2021 primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. Due to continued legal and regulatory challenges related to Mountain Valley Pipeline, NextEra Energy Resources also recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2022 of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax). See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses\n\nPTCs from wind projects and ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER's earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. Reflected in income taxes in NEE's consolidated statements of income are PTCs totaling approximately $90 million and $150 million and ITCs totaling approximately $237 million and $133 million in  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  A  portion  of  the  PTCs  and  ITCs  have  been  allocated  to  investors  in  connection  with  sales  of  differential membership interests. See Note 1 - Income Taxes for a discussion of PTCs and ITCs and Note 5.\n\n## Corporate and Other: Results of Operations\n\nCorporate and Other at NEE is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated  based  on  a  deemed  capital  structure  of  70%  debt  and  differential  membership  interests  sold  by  NextEra  Energy  Resources' subsidiaries.\n\nCorporate and Other's results increased $268 million during 2021 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $370 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments. The favorable non-qualifying hedge activity was partly offset by higher interest and refinancing costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures (see Note 15 - Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and  sales  of  assets  to  NEP  or  third  parties  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interest), consistent with NEE's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\n\nIn  October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests  in  NEP.  Under  the  program,  purchases  may  be  made  in  amounts,  at  prices  and  at  such  times  as  NEE  or  its  subsidiaries  deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated  by  NEE  at  any  time.  The  purpose  of  the  program  is  not  to  cause  NEP's  common  units  to  be  delisted  from  the  New  York  Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2021, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2021, NEE owned a noncontrolling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 55.0% of NEP's voting power.",

By 2023, the Corporate and Other segment experienced unfavorable after-tax impacts of approximately $793 million related to non-qualifying hedge activity, driven by changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances.

The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized.\n\n(b) See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests for a discussion of the sale of two solar generation facilities in Spain (Spain projects).\n\n(c) For 2019, approximately $44 million, $20 million and $6 million of costs are included in Corporate and Other's, Gulf Power's and NEER's net income, respectively.\n\n(d) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2020 related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).\n\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected  or  has  been  discontinued.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  those  transactions  are  marked  to  market  and  reported  in  the  consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the  non-qualifying  hedge  category  for  certain  energy  derivatives  is  offset  by  decreases  (increases)  in  the  fair  value  of  related  physical  asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance.

See Note 3.\n\n## 2021 Summary\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2021 was higher than 2020 by $654 million, or $0.33 per share, assuming dilution, due to higher results at the FPL segment, Corporate and Other, NEER and Gulf Power.\n\nFPL's net income increased by $316 million in 2021 primarily reflecting higher results at the FPL segment and at Gulf Power. The FPL segment's increase in net income for 2021 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property. Gulf Power's increase in net income in 2021 was primarily driven by reductions in O&amp;M expenses.",

In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE provided a detailed breakdown of Accrued Asset Removal Costs, showing a total of $489 million, with specific allocations across nuclear decommissioning, other generation plant dismantlement, and interim removal costs. By 2023, the detailed numerical disclosure of these costs was no longer explicitly presented. Instead, the 2023 report referenced Accrued Asset Removal Costs in the context of regulatory accounting differences within rate-regulated operations, particularly mentioning FPL and NEER's nuclear decommissioning and wind/solar dismantlement obligations without specific dollar figures. This indicates a shift from quantitative transparency to a more qualitative regulatory and operational framing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2022, NEE disclosed a detailed table showing Accrued Asset Removal Costs totaling $489 million, broken down by category and year.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2023, NEE no longer provided specific dollar amounts for these costs but referenced them in the context of regulatory accounting and asset retirement obligations related to nuclear and renewable facilities.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change represents a shift from detailed financial disclosure to a more conceptual and regulatory framing, reducing quantitative transparency."

      "answer": "In 2022, reserve amortization adjustments to Accrued Asset Removal Costs were explicitly tied to achieving the targeted regulatory ROE under the 2016 rate agreement, with the impact reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021, and noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020. In 2023, Accrued Asset Removal Costs were referenced in the context of AROs (Asset Retirement Obligations), particularly related to decommissioning nuclear units and dismantling wind and solar facilities, indicating a shift in focus toward long-term legal obligations rather than rate-regulated reserve adjustments. This evolution reflects a strategic and regulatory shift from cost recovery mechanisms to long-term liability planning.",

Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

      "question": "How did the treatment and recognition of disposal gains evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their financial impact and disclosure transparency?",
      "answer": "In 2022, disposal gains were reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and recognized in the income statement, with approximately $26 million ($6 million after tax) reclassified to 'gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.' This indicates that disposal gains were directly tied to prior hedging activities and were realized upon settlement of derivative instruments. In 2023, disposal gains were more transparently disclosed as a distinct line item in the income statement, with a total of $405 million reported under 'Gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net' for the year. This represents a shift from being a reclassified component of AOCI to a clearly itemized and standalone financial metric, enhancing transparency around the company's asset disposal activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, disposal gains were primarily recognized through reclassifications from AOCI, with $26 million reclassified to 'gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.'",
        "Step 2: In 2023, disposal gains were explicitly reported as a separate line item in the income statement with a total of $405 million recognized directly under 'Gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net.'",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how disposal gains were recognized and disclosed \u2014 from an indirect reclassification tied to derivatives in 2022 to a direct, transparent, and standalone financial metric in 2023, indicating a more explicit strategic or accounting shift in reporting asset disposals."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "answer": "In 2022, FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units was approximately $2.5 billion, or $1.2 billion expressed in 2021 dollars, with an annual expense of $48 million based on updated dismantlement studies effective January 1, 2022. By 2023, while the specific updated ultimate cost figure is not disclosed, the continued application of revised dismantlement studies and regulatory approvals indicates a sustained focus on increased dismantlement liability. The annual expense remained elevated at $48 million in 2023, showing no reduction in the accrual rate, which suggests that the dismantlement obligation continued to evolve in line with updated estimates and regulatory decisions.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, FPL disclosed an updated ultimate dismantlement cost of $2.5 billion with an annual expense of $48 million, effective from 2022.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, while the exact updated ultimate cost is not explicitly stated, the continuation of the $48 million annual expense indicates no reversal or reduction in the liability increase.",
        "Step 3: The sustained annual expense and lack of a new lower figure suggest that the dismantlement obligation remained stable or potentially increased, reflecting ongoing regulatory alignment with updated dismantlement studies."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nAsset  Retirement  Obligations -  NEE  and  FPL  each  account  for  asset  retirement  obligations  and  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived  assets.  NEE's AROs  relate  primarily  to  decommissioning  obligations  of  FPL's  and  NEER's  nuclear  units  and  to  obligations  for  the dismantlement  of  certain  of  NEER's  wind  and  solar  facilities.  See  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Plants,  Dismantlement  of  Plants  and  Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\n\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using  a  systematic  and  rational  method  over  the  asset's  estimated  useful  life.  Changes  in  the ARO  resulting  from  the  passage  of  time  are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted.\n\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs - For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear and other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear  decommissioning  and  other  generation  dismantlement  studies  periodically  filed  with  the  FPSC.  In  addition,  FPL  accrues  for  interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\n\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively, and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $10.2 billion, or $2.4 billion expressed in 2021 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the application submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds,  which  are  included  in  special  use  funds  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Marketable  securities  held  in  the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2021, 2020 and 2019 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $173 million, $132 million and $125 million, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\n\nOther  generation  plant  dismantlement  studies  are  performed  periodically  and  are  submitted  to  the  FPSC  for  approval.  Previously  approved studies were effective from January 1, 2017 through December 2021 and resulted in an annual expense of $26 million which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved a new annual expense of $48 million based on FPL's updated dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. At December  31,  2021,  FPL's  portion  of  the  ultimate  cost  to  dismantle  its  other  generation  units  is  approximately  $2.5  billion,  or  $1.2  billion expressed in 2021 dollars.\n\nNEER's AROs  primarily  include  nuclear  decommissioning  liabilities  for  Seabrook  Station  (Seabrook),  Duane  Arnold  Energy  Center  (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE reported $4,400 million in capital expenditures for NEER for that year, with $365 million planned for 2023. However, in 2023, there was no explicit forward-looking capital expenditure disclosure for NEER, and the focus in disclosures shifted toward legal proceedings and shareholder litigation involving NEE and FPL. This indicates a strategic shift or potential reduction in disclosed investment plans for NEER, possibly due to external legal pressures or internal strategic realignment.",

        "Step 3: The absence of NEER capital expenditure projections in 2023 compared to the explicit figures in 2022 suggests a strategic shift or reduction in emphasis on NEER, potentially influenced by legal challenges affecting overall corporate focus."

Other operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to a natural gas and oil electric generation facility and certain battery storage facilities that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, NEE recorded a net investment in sales-type leases of approximately $42 million and $47 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2024 to 2043 and NEE expects to receive approximately $843 million of lease payments over the remaining terms of the power sales agreements with no one year being material. Operating and sales-type lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income for the periods presented.\n\n## 11.

For  NEE's  rate-regulated  operations,  including  FPL,  the  accounting  provisions  result  in  timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting purposes and the method the regulator allows for recovery in rates.

In 2023, NEE no longer explicitly disclosed the specific percentage it assumed for the long-term rate of return, instead emphasizing its process for evaluating actuarial assumptions annually and referencing capital market return assumptions and historical returns.

          "chunk_text": "\nIn developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. In addition, for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its pension fund, as well as its pension fund's historical compounded returns. NEE believes that 7.35% is a reasonable long-term rate of return, net of investment management fees, on its pension plan assets. NEE will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as appropriate.\n\nNEE utilizes in its determination of pension income a market-related valuation of plan assets. This market-related valuation reduces year-to-year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this  purpose  are  the  difference  between  the  expected  return  calculated  using  the  market-related  value  of  plan  assets  and  the  actual  return realized on those plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of  plan  assets  will  be  affected  as  previously  deferred  gains  or  losses  are  recognized.  Such  gains  and  losses  together  with  other  differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of plan assets.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant:\n\n",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

By 2023, the relationship shifted to include direct intercompany commitments, with NEE showing $1,065 million, $40 million, and $5 million in joint obligations with NEECH for 2024 through 2026, respectively. This indicates a transition from a capital-structure-based cost allocation to a more direct financial stake with defined multi-year commitments.",

By 2024, NEECH had issued multiple tranches of debentures, including $4.5 billion in fixed-rate debentures and $500 million in floating-rate debentures, alongside junior subordinated debentures totaling $2.5 billion. This marks a shift from 2023, where the focus was on joint commitments, to 2024, where NEECH took a more active role in raising capital independently, backed by NEE's guarantee. This evolution reflects a strategic shift in how NEE structures its financial relationship with NEECH, moving toward more formalized and capitalized debt instruments.",

        "Step 3: The shift from shared obligations to NEECH independently issuing large-scale debt instruments backed by NEE indicates a transformation in their financial relationship, with NEECH becoming a more capitalized and structurally distinct entity under NEE\u2019s umbrella."

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn June 2024, NEE sold $2.0 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially , a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series N Debenture due June 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than June 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $50 in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from 0.6915 shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $72.31 (the reference price) to 0.5532 shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $90.38 (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a 20-day trading period ending on M ay 26, 2027. T otal annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 7.299%, consisting of interest on the debentures (5.15% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (2.149% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December 1, 2026. A  holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\n\nIn October 2024, NEE sold $1.5 billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially , a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series O Debenture due November 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $1,000 by NEECH.

By 2024, this relationship evolved significantly as NEE issued multiple tranches of equity units tied to NEECH debentures, including $2.0 billion in June and $1.5 billion in October, with NEECH's debentures being used to secure stock purchase contracts.

Additionally, NEER had 1,842 MW of merchant generation capacity, including nuclear and peak generation facilities. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future earnings contributions show a sharp decline after 2025, from $3,945 million in 2025 to just $370 million thereafter, suggesting a major reduction in NEER's financial contribution or operational footprint after the near term. This indicates a strategic shift or divestiture of NEER's assets post-2025, contrasting with the earlier portrayal of NEER as a substantial and contracted generation entity.",

      "question": "How has NEER's capital expenditure outlook evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about its investment strategy in clean energy assets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 30,600 MW of total net generating capacity and operated facilities with a total generating capacity of approximately 37,700 MW, reflecting a significant focus on expanding its clean energy portfolio. By 2024, NEER's capital expenditure outlook showed a sharp decline after the initial year, with $3,945 million allocated for 2025, dropping to $815 million in 2026, and continuing to decrease in subsequent years. This indicates a strategic shift from rapid capacity expansion in 2023 to a more measured or completion-based investment approach by 2024, potentially signaling the maturation of major projects or a pivot in capital allocation priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, NEER reported substantial generating capacity and emphasized development and construction of new clean energy assets.",
        "In 2024, the capital expenditure forecast showed a steep decline after 2025, indicating reduced investment levels in the near future.",
        "The contrast between growing capacity in 2023 and reduced planned spending in 2024 suggests a strategic evolution in NEER's investment approach."

However, in 2024, NEE disclosed a much more detailed and front-loaded capital investment plan for NEER, with $3,945 million allocated for 2025, sharply declining to $815 million in 2026, and only $250 million in 2027.

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) contributed significantly to NEE's revenue, with $24.8 billion in total revenue reported, of which NEER's portion was approximately $6.6 billion. NEER's revenue included income from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions. By 2024, NEER's accounting for derivatives showed a more detailed emphasis on fair value impact, with changes in fair value for power purchases, sales, and trading activities being recognized on a net basis in operating revenues. Additionally, 2024 highlighted the volatility introduced by non-qualifying hedges, which were marked to market and reported directly in the consolidated statements of income, indicating a more transparent and potentially volatile earnings profile tied to NEER's derivative positions.",

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed a positive $2,986 million to net income, significantly boosting NEER's results. However, in 2024, non-qualifying hedge activity had an unfavorable impact, contributing to a decline in NEER's performance despite the addition of 1,365 MW of wind, 2,507 MW of solar, and 755 MW of battery storage capacity. The reversal from a substantial gain to a negative impact reflects changing market conditions such as forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity resulted in a $2,986 million increase in net income, indicating a strong positive contribution.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the non-qualifying hedge activity had an unfavorable impact on results, contributing to a decline in NEER's earnings despite growth in renewable capacity.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation from a major earnings contributor in 2023 to a drag on performance in 2024, driven by shifts in underlying market variables."

T he change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forw ard pow er and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as w ell as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions w ere realized.\n\n(c) For 2023, approximately $300 million of gains are included in FPL's net income; the balance is included in NEER. See Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets for a discussion of the sale of FPL's ownership interest in its Florida City Gas business (FCG).\n\n(b) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value M easurements for a discussion of impairment charges related to the investment in X PLR in 2024 and 2023.\n\n(d) See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value M easurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2022 related to the investment in M ountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (M ountain Valley Pipeline).\n\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category , referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. A s a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economicallylinked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GA A P . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category , referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. A t FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\n## 2024 Summary\n\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2024 was lower than 2023 by $364 million, or $0.23 per share, assuming dilution, due to lower results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by higher results at Corporate and Other.\n\nFPL's net income decreased by $9 million in 2024 primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business in 2023 and a lower earned regulatory ROE in 2024, partly offset by continued investments in plant in service and other property.\n\nNEER's results decreased in 2024 primarily driven by unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023, partly offset by higher earnings from new investments. In 2024, NEER added approximately 1,365 M W of new wind generating capacity , 2,507 M W of solar generating capacity and 755 M W of battery storage capacity and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects.",
