      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment was described as including the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services, with a general emphasis on solar energy systems incentives. By 2024, the segment maintained its dual focus on solar and storage but provided more detailed emphasis on specific products like Powerwall and Megapack, with Powerwall being explicitly positioned for homes and small commercial facilities, and Megapack targeting large-scale commercial and utility customers with installations reaching gigawatt-hour capacities. Additionally, Tesla introduced real-time energy control and optimization platforms to manage these systems remotely. This indicates a strategic evolution toward more sophisticated integration and software capabilities in energy storage solutions.",

We have planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving ('FSD') (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other technologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term 'FSD (Supervised)' includes the equivalent naming convention, 'FSD (Capability)' that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Products\n\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours ('GWh') or greater capacity.\n\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How did Tesla's Automotive Regulatory Credits Revenue evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what factors contributed to the change?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla recognized revenue from automotive regulatory credits under various zero-emission vehicle and emissions compliance programs. By 2024, this revenue had increased by $973 million, or 54%, compared to 2023, driven by heightened demand for these credits in North America as other automakers scaled back their battery electric vehicle initiatives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Tesla disclosed that it earns and recognizes revenue from tradable regulatory credits under ZEV, greenhouse gas, and fuel economy regulations.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Tesla reported a 54% increase ($973 million) in automotive regulatory credits revenue compared to 2023, attributing the growth to increased demand in North America as competitors scaled back EV plans.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a significant increase in the importance of regulatory credit sales to Tesla's revenue, indicating a strategic and financial shift in how the company benefits from regulatory frameworks."

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies\n\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\n\nIn particular, Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Regulations\n\n## Vehicle Safety and Testing\n\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ('NHTSA'), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ('FMVSS') and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\n\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer's suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the 'EPA'), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\n\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020.\n\n## Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations specifically pertaining to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach ('adoption of the new lease standard'). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\n\n## Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.",

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned.\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## 2024 compared to 2023\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue decreased $3.25 billion, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily from lower raw material costs, freight and duties as well as mix , in addition to the volume changes in deliveries year over year as discussed above. The decreases were partially offset by higher costs for Cybertruck.\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $265 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries and a decrease in our direct operating lease cost of revenue driven by lower lease buyouts compared to the prior periods.\n\nCost of services and other revenue increased $2.09 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to volume increases in used vehicle sales at lower average vehicle acquisition cost, insurance services, paid Supercharging, part sales and non-warranty maintenance services and collision.\n\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 19.4% to 18.4% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to lower average selling price on our vehicles and Cybertruck ramp, partially offset by lower average combined cost per unit of our vehicles and increases in regulatory credit and FSD (Supervised) revenue, as discussed above.\n\nGross margin for total automotive &amp; services and other segment decreased from 18.2% to 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes in gross margin are primarily due to the automotive gross margin factors discussed above.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($1.8 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 2% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,120 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.0 billion). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($368 million).\n\nLicensed stores revenue increased $972 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($922 million) and the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency translation ($81 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million).\n\nOther revenues increased $249 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million).

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets\n\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.\n\nLong-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.\n\nOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store's ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial impairment charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.\n\nAsset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.\n\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance",

By 2023, the revenue for this segment had risen to $1,706 million, with a 15% increase (excluding currency translation) compared to 2022.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased by 80 basis points, primarily due to pricing increases and lower supply chain costs. However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",

These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided meditation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra.\n\nOutside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and, in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional month's salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\n\n## Role-based Support\n\nTo help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings, and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination.\n\n## Pay Equity\n\nTo be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\n\nStarbucks is committed to pay equity. We've achieved and maintained racial and gender pay equity for partners in the U.S. who are performing similar work, and we're working toward achieving gender pay equity for Starbucks partners who are performing similar work in all of our company-operated markets globally. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles, which provide equal footing, transparency, and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\n\nAs of September 29, 2024, Starbucks employed approximately 361,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 211,000 people, with approximately 201,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution operations. Approximately 150,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 144,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Approximately 5% of Starbucks partners in U.S. company-operated stores are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by low turnover, a strong culture, and active employee participation.\n\n## Information about our E xecutive Officers\n\n",

By fiscal 2024, this metric stood at 51.4%, up from 50.0% in fiscal 2023, indicating a continued upward trend, albeit at a slower pace than previously reported. The change between the two years was an increase of 140 basis points in 2023 followed by a more modest 140 basis point increase over the two-year span, suggesting a stabilization in expense growth.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, company-operated stores contributed $304 million to the total net revenue increase, driven by 1,426 net new stores opening over the past 12 months, which added $1.2 billion in incremental revenue. However, this was partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales, equivalent to $629 million, mainly due to a 4% drop in comparable transactions. By fiscal 2024, the total number of company-operated stores increased from 19,592 as of October 1, 2023, to 21,018 as of September 29, 2024, a net addition of 1,426 stores, indicating sustained expansion. However, the 2024 data does not directly quantify revenue changes, so while store growth remained consistent, the revenue impact seen in 2023 was not repeated in 2024's operational metrics.",

        "Step 1: In fiscal 2023, company-operated stores contributed $304 million to total net revenue growth, driven by $1.2 billion in incremental revenue from 1,426 net new stores, despite a $629 million drop from comparable store sales.",
        "Step 2: In fiscal 2024, the company added another 1,426 net new company-operated stores, increasing the total from 19,592 to 21,018, but no specific revenue contribution from these stores was disclosed.",
        "Step 3: The revenue contribution from company-operated stores increased significantly in 2023, while in 2024, the focus was on store expansion without a corresponding revenue metric, making it difficult to assess revenue evolution directly. However, the consistent store growth suggests a continuation of the expansion strategy."

By fiscal 2024, this amount increased significantly to $177 million in pre-tax income, driven by realized gains on the contingent consideration related to the same transaction.

      "answer": "In 2023, Lowe's disposed of its Canadian retail business, which included 232 company-operated stores and 210 dealer-owned stores under banners such as RONA and Lowe's Canada. This divestiture led to a $2.5 billion pre-tax impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs in fiscal 2022, which affected earnings. By 2024, Lowe's no longer owned the Canadian retail business but retained a financial stake in the form of performance-based contingent consideration tied to the business's post-sale performance. This contingent consideration was accounted for under the fair value option, with changes in its value recognized in SG&A expenses, indicating ongoing financial exposure to the business despite the divestiture.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) \u2013 Lowe's disposed of its Canadian retail business, which had a significant financial impact through a $2.5 billion pre-tax charge.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2013 Lowe's no longer directly operated the Canadian retail business but maintained a financial stake through contingent consideration linked to the business\u2019s post-sale performance.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2013 The relationship shifted from direct ownership and operation to a financial stake with no operational control, with financial implications continuing through changes in the fair value of contingent consideration."

On February 3, 2023, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which operated 232 stores in Canada, as well as serviced 210 dealer-owned stores. The Canadian retail business included a number of complementary formats under the banners of RONA, Lowe's Canada, R\u00e9no-D\u00e9p\u00f4t, and Dick's Lumber. See Note 6 for information on this divestiture.\n\nBelow are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\n\nFiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Fiscal 2022 contained 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2024 each contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022 represent the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, respectively.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nForeign Currency - The functional currencies of the Company's international subsidiaries are generally the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the ex change rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period.  The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders' deficit in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in SG&amp;A expense.\n\nUse of E stimates - The preparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets.  The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions process within two business days and are, therefore, classified as cash and cash equivalents.\n\nInvestments - Investments generally consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax , as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The proceeds from sales and gross realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nAlso included in long-term investments is performance-based contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business. The Company accounts for the contingent consideration under the fair value option under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, Financial Instruments, which requires the contingent consideration to be recorded at fair value upon recognition and as of each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized within SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as shortterm investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term. Available-for-sale debt securities classified as long-term as of January 31, 2025, will mature in one to three years, based on stated maturity dates.\n\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances pledged as collateral for the Company's extended protection plan program. Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $372 million as of January 31, 2025, and $307 million as of February 2, 2024.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $277 million as of January 31, 2025, and $252 million as of February 2, 2024.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, the company recognized a pre-tax income of $63 million related to the Canadian retail business transaction, primarily from a realized gain on contingent consideration and adjustments to the selling price. By fiscal 2024, this impact increased significantly to a pre-tax income of $177 million, driven by additional realized gains on contingent consideration.

By 2024, Lowe's no longer had an ownership stake in the Canadian retail business and instead recognized $177 million in pre-tax income from realized gains on the contingent consideration related to that sale, indicating a full transition from operational involvement to post-sale financial settlement.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

      "question": "How has Nike's Demand Creation Expense evolved from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, and what specific components contributed to this trend?",
      "answer": "Nike's Demand Creation Expense increased from $3,850 million in fiscal 2022 to $4,285 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a consistent upward trend over the two-year period. In fiscal 2022, the expense increased due to higher advertising and marketing costs. By fiscal 2024, the detailed breakdown showed that the expense included payments under endorsement contracts (expensed on a straight-line basis), contingent and variable payments based on performance, and cooperative advertising reimbursements to wholesale customers. The increase also corresponded with rising prepayments for advertising and promotion, which grew from $755 million in 2023 to $814 million in 2024, indicating Nike's growing investment in demand generation activities.",

Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs.

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract.

P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the construction and ramp of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities.\n\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2021, as well as in the long-term.",

By 2023, the facility was listed as 'Leased' in Tesla's primary manufacturing facilities table, indicating that while Tesla is still utilizing the site, it does not own the property outright, which may reflect a shift in capital allocation strategy or facility management approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop, California, but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest, and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by on-boarding and training new installers, as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\n\n## Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X, Megapack and Solar Roof, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $5.00 to $7.00 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years.\n\nOur business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as our stock price has significantly increased, we have seen higher levels of early conversions of 'in-themoney' convertible senior notes, which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\n## Operating Expense Trends\n\nAs long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. We believe in the long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash. As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded approximately $101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThere are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price.  In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During 2021, our reserve decreased approximately $14 million to $168 million as of January 28, 2022.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During 2021, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $49 million to $414 million as of January 28, 2022, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are",

By 2023, the company maintained the same general treatment of vendor funds but added more specificity around the conditions under which funds are classified as reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products, which are recorded as an offset to the related expense. This indicates a more refined and detailed approach to categorizing vendor funds based on their intended purpose, suggesting increased scrutiny or formalization of vendor funding agreements.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, vendor funds were primarily treated as a reduction in inventory cost and recognized upon sale, with a general process for accrual based on vendor agreements and historical trends.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company maintained the same core treatment but introduced a more explicit distinction between general vendor funds and those that reimburse specific, incremental, identifiable costs, which are treated as expense offsets.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift toward more precise categorization and accounting for vendor funds, reflecting a more structured and possibly compliance-focused approach in 2023 compared to 2022."

          "chunk_text": "Investments - Investments generally consist of agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nThe proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities were $308 million, $42 million, and $121 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as short-term investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term. Investments classified as longterm at January 28, 2022, will mature in one to three years, based on stated maturity dates.\n\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances primarily pledged as collateral for the Company's extended protection plan program. Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $271 million at January 28, 2022, and $506 million at January 29, 2021.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $199 million at January 28, 2022, and $200 million at January 29, 2021.\n\nMerchandise Inventory - The majority of the Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. Inventory for certain subsidiaries representing approximately 7% of the consolidated inventory balances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments, or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction impacts the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 28, 2022. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in",

The total associated income tax benefit recognized, exclusive of excess tax benefits, was $40 million, $29 million, and $15 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nTotal unrecognized share-based payment expense for all share-based payment plans was $299 million at January 28, 2022, of which $186 million will be recognized in 2022, $97 million in 2023, and $16 million thereafter.  This results in these amounts being recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\n\nFor all share-based payment awards, the expense recognized has been adjusted for estimated forfeitures where the requisite service is not expected to be met.  Estimated forfeiture rates are developed based on the Company's analysis of historical forfeiture data for homogeneous employee groups.\n\nGeneral terms and methods of valuation for the Company's share-based awards are as follows:\n\n## Stock Options\n\nStock options have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years, subsequent to the date of the grant, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the grant vesting period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.\n\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical volatility of the Company's stock price, as well as implied volatility.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options' expected term.  The expected term of the options is based on the Company's evaluation of option holders' exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and weightedaverage grant date fair value for options granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\n\n",

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended January 28, 2022, versus the year ended January 29, 2021, was due primarily to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net earnings. Accounts payable increased for fiscal 2021 by $466 million compared to an increase of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2020, driving a reduction of $2.7 billion in operating cash flows for fiscal 2021. Inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2021 by approximately $1.4 billion compared to a decrease of $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020. The increase in accounts payable and inventory in the prior year was driven by a ramp up in inventory purchase volume to meet sustained customer demand at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current year, we have continued to experience sustained demand levels and maintained a higher level of inventory and related accounts payable. Other operating liabilities decreased $570 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an increase of $813 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in other operating liabilities in the current year compared to the prior year is primarily driven by COVID-related accrued discretionary compensation for hourly associates in the prior year and timing of tax payments.\n\n## Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\n\n",

In 2023, the increase was attributed to higher advertising and marketing expenses and retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates. In 2024, the detailed breakdown shows that a significant portion of the expense was driven by payments under endorsement contracts, which are generally expensed on a straight-line basis over the contract term, and by contingent or variable payments tied to athlete performance. Additionally, cooperative advertising reimbursements to wholesale customers also contributed to the expense.

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract. H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

In 2024, the definition of Operating Overhead Expense remained consistent, including wage and benefit-related costs, but the company also highlighted increased prepayments for advertising, rising from $755 million in 2023 to $814 million in 2024.

H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. P repaid advertising and prom otion expenses totaled $814 m illion and $755 m illion at M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $420 m illion and $372 m illion, respectively, were recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets, and $394 m illion and $383 m illion, respectively, were recorded in D eferred incom e taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applied.\n\n## OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\n\nOperating overhead expense consists prim arily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and developm ent costs, bad debt expense as well as other adm inistrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and am ortization, professional services, certain technology investm ents, m eetings and travel.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 64",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike reported footwear revenue of $8,260 million globally. By fiscal 2024, this figure increased significantly to $33,427 million under the Nike Brand, with additional footwear revenue of $1,800 million attributed to CONVERSE. The 2024 report provides a regional breakdown not explicitly detailed in 2023, showing $14,537 million in North America, $8,473 million in Europe, Middle East & Africa, $5,552 million in Greater China, and $4,865 million in Asia Pacific & Latin America. This indicates a more granular reporting structure in 2024, highlighting Nike's geographic revenue distribution, which was not itemized in the prior year's consolidated footwear revenue.",

In fiscal 2023, Sales to Wholesale Customers were $3,736 million, accounting for about 58% of total revenues ($6,431 million).

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon disclosed that it had invested $5.6 billion in build-to-suit lease arrangements in 2021. By 2023, the company provided a more detailed classification policy, stating that property acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements is included in 'Property and equipment, net' when Amazon has control over the building during the construction period. Furthermore, if control continues post-construction, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation rather than a lease. This represents a shift toward more structured accounting treatment and control-based classification for build-to-suit leases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Amazon reported a capital investment of $5.6 billion in build-to-suit lease arrangements for the year 2021, indicating active use of such arrangements.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Amazon clarified its accounting policy, specifying that assets under build-to-suit leases are classified as property and equipment if control is maintained during construction, and as financing obligations if control continues after construction.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more nuanced and policy-driven approach to build-to-suit leases, moving from primarily quantitative disclosure to a classification framework based on control and asset recognition."

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon reported cash capital expenditures of $55.4 billion, reflecting a heavy focus on expanding capacity for fulfillment operations and AWS infrastructure. By 2023, while the company continued to invest in infrastructure, the narrative shifted toward more strategic management of capital expenditures, emphasizing efficiency and long-term sustainable growth in free cash flows. This indicates a transition from aggressive infrastructure build-out to a more disciplined capital allocation strategy aimed at optimizing existing assets and improving financial flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprimarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",

Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably.

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\n## Our Products and Services\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles - the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle ('SUV') built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel ex terior that has the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\n\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving ('FSD') (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other technologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term 'FSD (Supervised)' includes the equivalent naming convention, 'FSD (Capability)' that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Products\n\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours ('GWh') or greater capacity.\n\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How has Tesla's relationship with Gigafactory Shanghai evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its operational commitments and financial incentives tied to capital expenditures and tax revenue targets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Gigafactory Shanghai was listed as an active production location manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. By 2024, Tesla disclosed a formal agreement with the Shanghai local government that introduced new operational conditions tied to cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue requirements starting in late 2023. Additionally, while incentives received in 2023 were deemed immaterial, Tesla continued to receive immaterial amounts in 2024, indicating that while the financial impact remained minor, the nature of the relationship evolved from operational to more formally structured with defined performance obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Gigafactory Shanghai was actively producing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, with no mention of specific financial agreements or obligations tied to the facility.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Tesla disclosed a structured agreement with the Shanghai government that included commitments to meet capital expenditure and tax revenue targets, with incentives tied to these conditions, though the amounts were still considered immaterial.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from a purely operational presence to a more formalized strategic relationship involving performance-based incentives and obligations."

          "chunk_text": "## Customer Deposits\n\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer's purchase balance.\n\n## Government Assistance Programs and Incentives\n\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.\n\n## The IRA Incentives\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Gigafactory New York-New York State Investment and Lease\n\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations and was not material for any period presented.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai-Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\n\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). Incentives that offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are recorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts received were immaterial.\n\n## Nevada Tax Incentives\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax  credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment was primarily described as part of its broader business model, with a focus on the accounting treatment of variable interest entities (VIEs) tied to solar energy systems and vehicle leases. The segment was acknowledged as one of two reportable segments, but no specific product details or strategic emphasis were provided in the evidence chunk. By 2024, Tesla significantly expanded its description of the segment, highlighting specific products like Powerwall and Megapack, emphasizing their lithium-ion battery technology and use cases across residential, commercial, industrial, and utility markets. Additionally, Tesla introduced software capabilities for real-time energy control and optimization, indicating a stronger integration of software with its energy storage offerings. This evolution reflects a shift from a financially-focused segment disclosure in 2023 to a more product- and strategy-driven narrative in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Tesla's disclosure focused on the accounting policies related to VIEs and financial consolidation, indicating a financial and structural view of the Energy Generation and Storage segment.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\n\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\n\n## Our Products and Services\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles - the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle ('SUV') built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel ex terior that has the utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\n\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving ('FSD') (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other technologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term 'FSD (Supervised)' includes the equivalent naming convention, 'FSD (Capability)' that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Products\n\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours ('GWh') or greater capacity.\n\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How has Tesla's strategic utilization of Gigafactory Nevada evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of production activities and associated tax incentives, and what does this suggest about Tesla's broader financial and operational planning for the facility?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla was engaged in pilot production of the Tesla Semi at Gigafactory Nevada, indicating early-stage manufacturing activity at the facility. By 2024, the company was benefiting from long-standing tax incentives tied to its 2014 agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County, including abatements for specified taxes, energy rate discounts, and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million, which were linked to capital investment and hiring targets already met. This evolution suggests that Tesla has moved from initial production ramp-up to leveraging financial incentives to support ongoing operations, indicating a strategic shift from facility development to optimizing cost structures and operational efficiency at Gigafactory Nevada.",

Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer's purchase balance.\n\n## Government Assistance Programs and Incentives\n\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.\n\n## The IRA Incentives\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Gigafactory New York-New York State Investment and Lease\n\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations and was not material for any period presented.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai-Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\n\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). Incentives that offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are recorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts received were immaterial.\n\n## Nevada Tax Incentives\n\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax  credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lowe's specifically noted that amounts accrued for vendor funds could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differed from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in programs that provide increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. This highlights an explicit sensitivity to the accuracy of projections in vendor agreements tied to volume thresholds. In 2024, while the company maintained the same general accounting treatment\u2014recognizing vendor funds as a reduction in inventory cost and emphasizing the importance of historical trends and vendor confirmations\u2014the language around the impact of actual versus projected volumes under graduated programs was omitted. This suggests a potential shift in emphasis or internal control structure around accrual adjustments, possibly indicating greater confidence in forecasting accuracy or a procedural change in how these adjustments are managed and disclosed. The removal of explicit mention of volume variance impacts may reflect a reduced perceived risk or a streamlined vendor fund accrual process.",

          "chunk_text": "Investments - Investments generally consist of agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\nThe proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities were $308 million, $42 million, and $121 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as short-term investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term. Investments classified as longterm at January 28, 2022, will mature in one to three years, based on stated maturity dates.\n\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances primarily pledged as collateral for the Company's extended protection plan program. Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $271 million at January 28, 2022, and $506 million at January 29, 2021.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $199 million at January 28, 2022, and $200 million at January 29, 2021.\n\nMerchandise Inventory - The majority of the Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. Inventory for certain subsidiaries representing approximately 7% of the consolidated inventory balances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.  The Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments, or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks. All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021. The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction impacts the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 28, 2022. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 24, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023.

Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\n\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as short-term investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term.

Restricted balances included in short-term investments were $271 million at January 28, 2022, and $506 million at January 29, 2021.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $199 million at January 28, 2022, and $200 million at January 29, 2021.\n\nMerchandise Inventory - The majority of the Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting. Inventory for certain subsidiaries representing approximately 7% of the consolidated inventory balances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\n\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on management's current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience. Management does not believe the Company's merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.

Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments, or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor's product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments - The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and ex penses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an inventory reserve for the estimated adjustment to mark down merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV). This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During fiscal 2024, our reserve decreased approximately $23 million to $222 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During fiscal 2024, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  The majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related ex pense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of markdown in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for inventory during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. A 10% change in either the amount of inventory subject to markdown or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our LCNRV inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2024. A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables",

In fiscal 2023, these expenses increased to $15,286.5 million, representing 42.3% of total net revenues.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Government Subsidies\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act'), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ('CEWS') to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $210.0 million and $349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $69.4 million and $172.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $26.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $104.7 million and $116.5 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs') or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-ScholesMerton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.",

Additional disclosure regarding changes in our equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included in Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance. \u00ae\n\nWe also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50% owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks beverages, including Frappuccino coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot espresso drinks, Starbucks Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks Iced Coffee. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $80.9 million, $160.8 million and $123.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related product and distribution costs were $76.5 million, $92.1 million and $79.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, there were $14.8 million and $7.9 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues.\n\nAdditionally, we hold equity interests in other entities to support our corporate and investment strategies. The related financial statements activities were not material during the periods presented.\n\n## Other Investments\n\nWe have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's highlighted Systemwide Sales as a key component of its 'Accelerating the Arches' growth strategy, emphasizing its dependence on the success of this metric to drive business growth, particularly through digital transformation, delivery, and restaurant development. However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Systemwide Sales was referenced as a strategic objective within the 'Accelerating the Arches' strategy, with emphasis on its importance to growth but without detailed disclosure of measurement or linkage to franchisee performance.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how McDonald's communicates its reliance on Systemwide Sales\u2014from a forward-looking strategic goal in 2023 to a core, quantified performance metric in 2024."

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS\n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, some of which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. M anagement believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.\n\n- Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. M anagement reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n- Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of A pril 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (V enezuela continues to be excluded). Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n- Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales to loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company-owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across 60 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days of the respective quarter. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n- The Company's after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiv eness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.\n- Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate.",

      "answer": "In 2023, consumer packaged goods sales were explicitly mentioned as part of the Company's 'Other revenues,' which included revenues from brand licensing arrangements using the McDonald's brand. In 2024, while the mention of brand licensing arrangements remained, the specific reference to consumer packaged goods was omitted from the description of revenue sources, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential reclassification of this revenue stream. This evolution indicates a subtle shift in how the company is presenting its revenue sources, even though the overall structure remains largely franchising-focused.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, consumer packaged goods sales were explicitly listed as part of 'Other revenues' alongside brand licensing arrangements.",

        "Step 3: The removal of the explicit mention of consumer packaged goods in 2024 suggests a change in emphasis or possible reclassification, indicating an evolution in how the company describes its revenue sources."

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\n\n## We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\n\nWe are subject to a variety of tax es and tax  collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax  ex pense and be subject to additional tax  liabilities, including other liabilities for tax  collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For ex ample, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted tax es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax  measures may continue unless broader international tax  reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\n\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax  reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\n\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special or ex traterritorial tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\n\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax  assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax  applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax  accruals.\n\n## We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\n\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\n\n## Item 1B.

We will execute our strategy with a diverse team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.\n\nThe automotive industry and GM are currently experiencing a global semiconductor supply shortage. The supply shortage has impacted, and continues to impact, multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. We expect the availability of semiconductors to improve throughout 2022. We will continue prioritizing our most popular and in-demand vehicles, including our full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, and EVs. We do not expect this shortage to impact our long-term growth and EV initiatives.  In  June  2021,  we  announced plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, in part to accelerate battery and EV assembly capacity.\n\nWe also continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread, and the potential to affect our operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.\n\nFor  the  year  ending  December  31,  2022,  we  expect  EPS-diluted  and  EPS-diluted-adjusted  of  between  $6.25  and  $7.25,  Net income attributable to stockholders of between $9.4 billion and $10.8 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $13.0 billion and $15.0 billion.

      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon's segment reporting did not explicitly clarify the detailed allocation of infrastructure costs to the AWS segment, and AWS was presented as one of the operating segments among others. By 2024, Amazon provided more granular disclosure indicating that the majority of infrastructure costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' were specifically allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. This evolution reflects a more explicit and usage-based cost attribution methodology applied to AWS, highlighting its growing operational and financial significance within the company's structure.",

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax  benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024 were $(7) million, $91 million, and $121 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.\n\nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax  assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income.\n\nIn September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority ('LTA') denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA's position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid.\n\nThe Indian tax authority ('ITA') has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA's position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax  ex pense, including for tax es previously paid.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax  contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax ing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the nex t twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and infrastructure,' 'Sales and marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker ('CODM') is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include 'Cost of sales,' 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and infrastructure,' 'Sales and marketing,' 'General and administrative,' and 'Other operating expense (income), net.' Our CODM manages our business primarily by reviewing consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis, and using those results along with forecasts and other non-financial information in our annual budgeting process.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM's EBIT-adjusted was $1,210 billion with a 7.6% margin, reflecting tax benefits from the release of a valuation allowance in Korea. By 2024, EBIT-adjusted dropped to $303 billion with a 2.2% margin, representing a 75% decrease. This sharp decline indicates a substantial deterioration in core profitability, negatively impacted by volume declines and other unspecified adverse factors, signaling weakening operational performance and reduced efficiency in converting sales into earnings over this period.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, GM reported an EBIT-adjusted of $1,210 billion with a 7.6% margin, supported by tax benefits from the release of a valuation allowance in Korea.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, EBIT-adjusted fell to $303 billion with a margin of 2.2%, a 75% decrease, driven by volume declines and other adverse factors.",
        "Step 3: The significant drop in EBIT-adjusted and margin reveals a deterioration in GM's underlying profitability, indicating challenges in sustaining earnings growth and operational efficiency."

      "question": "How did the trend in General Motors' Total Net Sales and Revenue change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's revenue performance over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, General Motors reported Total Net Sales and Revenue of $141.445 billion, showing a favorable variance of $13.067 billion (10.2%) compared to 2022. However, in 2024, the company's Total Net Sales and Revenue dropped to $13.890 billion, representing an unfavorable variance of $2.059 billion (12.9%) compared to 2023. This indicates a significant reversal in revenue performance, transitioning from strong growth in 2023 to a notable decline in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue was $141.445 billion, reflecting a $13.067 billion (10.2%) increase from 2022.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue fell to $13.890 billion, showing a $2.059 billion (12.9%) decrease from 2023.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation from strong year-over-year revenue growth in 2023 to a significant decline in 2024, indicating a deterioration in revenue performance."

      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's described Systemwide Sales Growth as a key performance metric that reflects sales at all restaurants\u2014company-operated and franchised\u2014and emphasized its importance in understanding franchised revenues and the financial health of the franchisee base. The 2022 report highlighted that Systemwide Sales were driven primarily by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion, and it reported Systemwide Sales Growth at 21% (or $112.5 billion) for 2021. By 2024, the company expanded the definition to include more granular insights into customer engagement, specifically highlighting Systemwide Sales to loyalty members across 60 markets. This new segmentation showed that the company now uses Systemwide Sales not only to assess franchisee health and revenue generation but also to track the impact of its loyalty programs on overall sales. This evolution indicates a shift from a purely financial performance lens to a more customer-centric view of Systemwide Sales Growth.",

Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.\n\n- Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n- Comparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19). Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n- Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n- The Company's after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.\n- Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate.\n\n## 2021 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2021, global comparable sales increased 17.0%, primarily due to strong sales performance across all segments from continued execution of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, as well as recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year.\n\n- Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 13.8%, benefiting primarily from strong average check growth, successful menu and marketing promotions and growth in digital channels, which benefited from the launch of the Company's loyalty program.\n- Comparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 21.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all markets, primarily driven by the U.K. and France.\n- Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment increased 16.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all geographic regions.\n\nIn addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results in 2021:\n\n- Consolidated revenues increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $23.2 billion.\n- Systemwide sales increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $112.5 billion.\n- Consolidated operating income increased 41% (38% in constant currencies) to $10.4 billion. Refer to the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\n- Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 38.1% in 2020 to 44.6% in 2021. Excluding net strategic gains detailed in the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K, operating margin increased from 36.7% in 2020 to 43.4% in 2021.\n- Diluted earnings per share of $10.04 increased 59% (56% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 12 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 8",

      "answer": "In 2022, McDonald's primarily linked Systemwide sales to increases, indicating a focus on growth trends. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to provide a detailed explanation of Systemwide sales, including their composition from both company-owned and franchised restaurants, the impact of loyalty members across 60 markets, and the metric's importance in understanding franchisee health and calculating franchised revenues.

However, by 2024, this trajectory reversed sharply, with a 12.9% decline in revenue, equating to a $2.059 billion drop. The 2024 decline was primarily driven by volume-related pressures ($1.6 billion negative impact), as well as other unspecified factors contributing an additional $1.1 billion drag, despite slight improvements in mix and pricing.

      "answer": "In 2022, Cruise's EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted increased primarily due to rising developmental costs as the company progressed toward commercializing a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the U.S. By 2024, this trend reversed, with EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted decreasing as a result of restructuring actions taken in 2023 that reduced development costs. This shift was further supported by the integration of Cruise and GM technical efforts\u2014aimed at advancing autonomous and assisted driving\u2014which was expected to drive cost efficiencies going forward. The change reflects a strategic refocusing under GM\u2019s broader operational adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Cruise's EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted increased, driven by higher developmental costs linked to advancing AV commercialization.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Cruise's EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted decreased due to restructuring in 2023 that lowered development costs and integrated Cruise\u2019s efforts with GM\u2019s technical teams.",
        "Step 3: The change from rising to falling EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted reflects a strategic pivot from aggressive investment in AV development to cost containment and operational synergy realization."

In contrast, the 2023-2024 period saw a $2.059 billion (12.9%) decrease in Total Net Sales and Revenue, with volume negatively impacting revenue by $1.6 billion and price contributing only a minor $0.2 billion positive variance.

However, in fiscal 2023, this metric declined by 3.6% to $604.55.

We opened five new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2021, resulting in a total store count of 2,317 at January 30, 2022, which includes 14 stores in the U.S. from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020. See the 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).",

We believe these associate- and supplier-focused priorities also enhance our customers' experience:\n\n## \u00b7 Associates\n\n- Increase diverse representation throughout our organization\n- Create an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are\n- Promote equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement\n- Community\n- Strive to close the wealth gap\n- Advance education for all\n- Suppliers\n- Increase use of and spend with diverse suppliers\n- Develop diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and sharing resources\n\nCompensation and Benefits. Consistent with our core values, we take care of our people by offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits programs. We continuously make wage investments to ensure our compensation packages reflect the evolving circumstances across our markets, and our profit-sharing program for hourly associates provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our business plan. We provided enhanced pay and benefits for our associates in fiscal 2020 to alleviate some of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we began to transition from these temporary COVID-19 benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline, hourly associates. In fiscal 2021, we continued to make additional compensation enhancements. Our associates can take advantage of a range of benefits, including healthcare and wellness programs, vacation and leave of absence benefits including parental leave and paid sick/personal time off, a 401(k) match, our ESPPs, personal finance education and advisory services, assistance programs to help with managing personal and work-life challenges, family support programs, and educational assistance.\n\nOperate Sustainably. We have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business operations, from the products and services we offer to our customers; to our store construction, maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to operate sustainably, we have focused on protecting the climate, reducing our environmental impact, and sourcing responsibly, and we have set specific, measurable goals to drive progress in these areas.",

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes.\n\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs, along with timing of vendor payments.\n\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to $7.8 billion of net consideration paid to acquire HD Supply in fiscal 2020, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt.\n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.9 billion of repayments of long-term debt, $974 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and $791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, partially offset by $7.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventories\n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.",

By 2023, while accounting charges remained a consideration, the company expanded the context to include macroeconomic conditions, changes in interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates as additional influences on capital allocation and financial projections. This evolution indicates a broader framing of financial uncertainty, integrating both internal accounting factors and external economic pressures when discussing forward-looking expectations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the document explicitly tied accounting charges to financial metrics such as earnings per share, dividend targets, and return on invested capital, indicating a direct impact on financial outlook.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the discussion of accounting charges was maintained but contextualized alongside new external factors like macroeconomic conditions, interest rate changes, and foreign currency exchange, which were not mentioned in 2022.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a primarily internal financial risk focus in 2022 to a more integrated view in 2023, where accounting charges are part of a broader set of influences affecting capital allocation and forward-looking guidance."

Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related recovery on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition (which, among other things, may affect many of the items listed below); the demand for our products and services; net sales growth; comparable sales; the effects of competition; our brand and reputation; implementation of store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives; inventory and in-stock positions; the state of the economy; the state of the housing and home improvement markets; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans, and consumer credit; impact of tariffs; issues related to the payment methods we accept; demand for credit offerings; management of relationships with our associates, potential associates, suppliers and service providers; cost and availability of labor; costs of fuel and other energy sources; international trade disputes, natural disasters, climate change, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines, related shut-downs and other governmental orders, and similar restrictions, as well as subsequent reopenings), cybersecurity events, military conflicts or acts of war, and other business interruptions that could disrupt operation of our stores, distribution centers and other facilities, our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems, or supply or delivery of, or demand for, the Company's products or services; our ability to meet ESG goals; continuation or suspension of share repurchases; net earnings performance; earnings per share; dividend targets; capital allocation and expenditures; liquidity; return on invested capital; expense leverage; stockbased compensation expense; commodity or other price inflation and deflation; our ability to issue debt on terms and at rates acceptable to us; the impact and expected outcome of investigations, inquiries, claims, and litigation, including compliance with related settlements; the effect of accounting charges; the effect of adopting certain accounting standards; the impact of regulatory changes, including changes to tax laws and regulations; store openings and closures; financial outlook; and the impact of acquired companies, including HD Supply, on our organization and the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond our control, dependent on the actions of third parties, or currently unknown to us - as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' and elsewhere in this report and also as may be described from time to time in future reports we file with the SEC. You should read such information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in this report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described herein, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC and in our other public statements.",
