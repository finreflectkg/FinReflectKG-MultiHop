      "answer": "In 2022, the Compute & Networking segment generated $11.046 billion in revenue, contributing significantly to NVIDIA's consolidated revenue of $26.914 billion, with a clear delineation of financial performance across segments. By 2024, the segment's operational focus had evolved, as evidenced by the company disclosing that its top direct customers, each contributing over 10% of total revenue, were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a strategic shift toward deepening relationships with major direct clients, even though specific revenue figures for 2024 are not provided, suggesting a more concentrated and stakeholder-driven approach in 2024 compared to the broader segment reporting in 2022.",

We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.\n\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training  and  inference  for  cloud  computing  and AI  workloads  such  as  natural  language  processing  and deep recommender models.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.\n\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue.\n\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.\n\nRevenue  for  our  CMP  products  declined  significantly  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2022.  We  are  unable  to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.\n\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\n\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\n\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\n\n## Market Platform Highlights\n\nAt  our  November  2021  GPU  Technology  Conference,  we  announced  general  availability  of  NVIDIA  Omniverse Enterprise;  65  new  and  updated  software  development  kits,  including  NVIDIA  Riva,  Modulus,  ReOpt,  Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara Holoscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI and autonomous machines.\n\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\n\nIn  our  Data  Center  platform,  we  launched  new  NVIDIA A30  and A10  GPUs  for  mainstream AI,  data  analytics  and graphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our first Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to addressing the global climate change crisis.\n\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop workstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual worlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.",

Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and A utomotive.\n\n## Data Center\n\nThe  NVIDIA   Data  Center  platform  is  focused  on  accelerating  the  most  compute-intensive  workloads,  such  as A I,  data  analytics,  graphics,  and  scientific computing, delivering significantly better performance and power efficiency relative to conventional CPU-only approaches. It is deployed in cloud, hyperscale, onpremises and edge data centers. The platform consists of compute and networking offerings typically delivered to customers as systems, subsystems, or modules, along with software and services.\n\nOur compute offerings include supercomputing platforms and servers, bringing together our energy efficient GPUs, CPUs, interconnects, and fully optimized A I and HPC software stacks. In addition, they include NVIDIA  A I Enterprise software; our DGX  Cloud service; and a growing body of acceleration libraries, A PIs, SDKs, and domain-specific application frameworks.\n\nOur networking offerings include end-to-end platforms for InfiniBand and Ethernet, consisting of network adapters, cables, DPUs, switch chips and systems, as well as a full software stack. This has enabled us to architect data center-scale computing platforms that can interconnect thousands of compute nodes with high-performance  networking.  While  historically  the  server  was  the  unit  of  computing,  as A I  and  HPC  workloads  have  become  extremely  large  spanning thousands of compute nodes, the data center has become the new unit of computing, with networking as an integral part.\n\nOur customers include the world's leading public cloud and consumer internet companies, thousands of enterprises and startups, and public sector entities. We work  with  industry  leaders  to  help  build  or  transform  their  applications  and  data  center  infrastructure.  Our  direct  customers  include  original  equipment manufacturers, or OEM s, original device manufacturers, or ODM s, system integrators and distributors which we partner with to help bring our products to market. We also have partnerships in automotive, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail, and technology among others, to accelerate the adoption of A I.\n\nAt the foundation of the NV IDIA  accelerated computing platform are our GPUs, which excel at parallel workloads such as the training and inferencing of neural networks. They are available in the NV IDIA  accelerated computing platform and in",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Oracle emphasized its Fusion Cloud SaaS offerings, such as ERP, EPM, SCM, and HCM, which were built on open standards like SQL and Java and aimed at reducing IT complexity while providing flexible deployment models. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle expanded its strategic positioning by explicitly linking its cloud services to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), describing its SaaS offerings as an 'industry leading business innovation platform' leveraging OCI. This evolution indicates a stronger emphasis on integration with its underlying infrastructure and broader deployment flexibility across on-premise, cloud-based, and hybrid models.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nWe begin Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and j udgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fi s cal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi s cal year ended May 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on June 20, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise IT needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n\u00b7 Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n\no cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer's option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over ti me; and o l i cense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or onpremise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, which increased to 37% in fiscal 2024. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings and aligns with Oracle's corporate strategy of providing customer choice in deployment models.

Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in ti me when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud l i censes and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over ti me. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\n\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 37%, 32% and 25% of our total revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nOur cloud and license business' revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\n\u00b7 expected growth in our cloud services offerings; and\n\n\u00b7 continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.\n\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business' total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make i nvestments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n\nOur cloud and license business' margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fi xed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers' cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle explicitly highlighted its Services Business as one of three core operating segments, dedicating a full section to its role in providing Oracle license support services and cloud services, which included unspecified updates and technical support. The segment was clearly defined and aligned with how the company\u2019s CODMs allocated resources. By fiscal 2023, while the Services Business was still acknowledged as one of the three businesses, it was mentioned more peripherally and without the same level of detailed explanation. Instead, the 2023 filing placed stronger emphasis on Oracle Cloud Services, positioning them as central to customer migration strategies and broader ecosystem engagement. This shift suggests a refocusing of strategic narrative toward cloud offerings, with services playing a less prominent role in the public positioning of Oracle's business model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the Services Business was clearly defined as a core segment with specific revenue components, including license support and cloud services, and was tied directly to Oracle\u2019s resource allocation and decision-making.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the Services Business was still listed as one of the three businesses but was not elaborated upon in the provided text. Instead, the narrative centered on Oracle Cloud Services and their role in customer migration and expansion.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how Oracle presented its Services Business\u2014moving from a central, well-defined segment in 2022 to a less emphasized component in 2023, as the company increasingly aligned its messaging with cloud-centric strategies."

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  and  judgments  incorporated  in  our  reported  financial  results.  We  then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. A discussion  regarding  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  fiscal  2021  compared  to  fiscal  2020  can  be  found  in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on June 21, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployments).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Item  1  Business  and  Note  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business,  which  represented  85%  and  84%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2022  and  2021,  respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n- Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n- o license  support  revenues,  which  are  earned  by  providing  Oracle  license  support  services  to  customers  that  have elected  to  purchase  support  services  in  connection  with  the  purchase  of  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure software  licenses  for  use  in  cloud,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  Substantially  all  license  support customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and\n- o cloud  services  revenues,  which  provide  customers  access  to  Oracle  Cloud  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment  models  that Oracle develops, provides unspecified  updates  and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that",

      "answer": "Oracle's hardware expenses decreased from $972 million in fiscal year 2022 to $891 million in fiscal year 2023, indicating an improvement in cost management for its hardware business. This reduction in expenses aligns with Oracle's strategic focus on more profitable hardware offerings, such as Oracle Engineered Systems, while de-emphasizing lower-margin commodity products, as noted in the 2022 filing.",

        "Step 1: In fiscal year 2022, Oracle reported hardware expenses of $972 million and highlighted challenges in its hardware business, including supply chain disruptions and declining profitability.",
        "Step 2: By fiscal year 2023, hardware expenses dropped to $891 million, showing a reduction in costs despite ongoing supply chain pressures.",
        "Step 3: The decrease in hardware expenses reflects improved cost control and a strategic shift toward higher-margin hardware products, suggesting a more efficient operational approach in the hardware segment."

Increased  customer  demand  for  these  services,  without  corresponding  revenues,  could increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal",

License  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of applications and infrastructure license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that  we  develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applications  software  products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct  sales  through  our  own  sales  force.  We  also  continue  to  market  certain  of  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.",

      "question": "How did the impact of the FDII tax benefit on AMD's taxable income evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what change in U.S. tax regulations contributed to this evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD benefited from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) tax benefit, which contributed $147 million to its income tax provision. By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, AMD reported a $147 million FDII tax benefit as part of its income tax provision, showing a direct positive impact on its tax position.",
        "By 2024, the FDII benefit was still relevant, but its nature had evolved due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required capitalization of R&D expenses, thereby increasing taxable income and the base of income eligible for FDII benefits.",
        "The evolution shows that while the FDII benefit remained a positive factor, its impact mechanism changed from a direct tax reduction to an indirect benefit through increased taxable income due to regulatory changes."

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

By 2024, this revenue stream had grown to $32,537 million. Additionally, in 2024, CRM began disclosing the breakdown of this revenue as a percentage of total revenues, where Subscription and Support Revenue accounted for 18% of total revenue. This indicates that not only did the metric continue to grow in absolute terms, but it also maintained a significant proportional role in the company's revenue base.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Embedded segment was identified as one of AMD's four reportable segments, including products such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. However, in 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion. This decline was attributed to customers normalizing their inventory levels. Therefore, the Embedded segment's financial performance significantly decreased between 2023 and 2024 due to inventory adjustments by customers.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 'Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn  this  section,  we  will  describe  the  general  financial  condition  and  the  results  of  operations  of Adv anced  Micro  Dev ices,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectiv ely, 'us,' 'our' or 'AMD'), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and  2022  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2024, we deliv ered strong annual rev enue growth with net rev enue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. T his growth was driv en by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net rev enue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driv en by higher sales of our AMD Instinct\u2122 GPUs and AMD EPYC\u2122 CPUs. Client segment net rev enue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen\u2122 mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net rev enue was  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  net  rev enue  in  our  Gaming  and  Embedded  segments.  Gaming  net  rev enue  of  $2.6  billion  decreased  by  58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net rev enue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product rev enue. Embedded net rev enue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net rev enue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inv entory lev els.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our  Data  Center  segment.  The  demand for  our  Data  Center AI  accelerator  products  was  v ery  strong  led  by  large hyperscale  cloud  customers  deploying  our  AMD  Instinct  MI300X   GPU  accelerators.  During  the  year,  we  unv eiled  an  accelerated  AMD  Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. T o further expand our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio, we launched our  5th  Gen  AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors,  formerly  codenamed  'Turin,'  built  with  our  latest  'Z en  5'  core  architecture  designed  to  deliv er  leadership performance and efficiency.\n\nWe took a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our 'Zen 5' architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by our X DNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and desktop PCs that deliv er leadership performance in gaming, productiv ity and content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation\u00ae 5 Pro, which features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliv er increases in graphics and ray tracing performance to enable AIdriv en upscaling.\n\nWe expanded our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of the new Versal\u2122 Series Gen 2 dev ices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptiv e SoCs, which bring preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single dev ice for end-to-end acceleration of AI-driv en embedded systems.\n\nT o execute our AI strategy, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to driv e dev elopment of a comprehensiv e software ecosystem spanning our  full  product  portfolio.  We  made  sev eral  key  optimizations  and  introduced  new  features  in  the  latest  AMD  ROCm\u2122  software  that  increased performance  in  key  generativ e  AI  workloads,  expanded  support  and  optimization  for  additional  frameworks  and  libraries,  and  simplified  the  ov erall developer experience. We also made strategic inv estments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has  also  dev eloped  a  software  stack  used  to  train  multiple  state-of-the-art  large  language  models  (LLMs)  on  AMD  Instinct  accelerators  that  can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD's Embedded segment was part of its four reportable segments, indicating it was a strategic focus area with offerings such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, SOMs, and Adaptive SoC products. However, by 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion. This decline was attributed to customers normalizing their inventory levels. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the strategic importance of embedded markets such as healthcare, automotive, and industrial, the 2024 report did not highlight the Embedded segment as a growth driver, suggesting a relative shift in strategic emphasis.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 'Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn  this  section,  we  will  describe  the  general  financial  condition  and  the  results  of  operations  of Adv anced  Micro  Dev ices,  Inc.  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectiv ely, 'us,' 'our' or 'AMD'), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and  2022  that  are  not  included  in  this  Form  10-K  can  be  found  in  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2024, we deliv ered strong annual rev enue growth with net rev enue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. T his growth was driv en by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net rev enue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driv en by higher sales of our AMD Instinct\u2122 GPUs and AMD EPYC\u2122 CPUs. Client segment net rev enue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen\u2122 mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net rev enue was  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  net  rev enue  in  our  Gaming  and  Embedded  segments.  Gaming  net  rev enue  of  $2.6  billion  decreased  by  58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net rev enue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product rev enue. Embedded net rev enue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net rev enue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inv entory lev els.\n\nDuring the year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024 was to accelerate growth in our  Data  Center  segment.  The  demand for  our  Data  Center AI  accelerator  products  was  v ery  strong  led  by  large hyperscale  cloud  customers  deploying  our  AMD  Instinct  MI300X   GPU  accelerators.  During  the  year,  we  unv eiled  an  accelerated  AMD  Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliv er an annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. T o further expand our high-performance serv er CPU portfolio, we launched our  5th  Gen  AMD  EPYC\u2122  processors,  formerly  codenamed  'Turin,'  built  with  our  latest  'Z en  5'  core  architecture  designed  to  deliv er  leadership performance and efficiency.\n\nWe took a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our 'Zen 5' architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by our X DNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and desktop PCs that deliv er leadership performance in gaming, productiv ity and content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation\u00ae 5 Pro, which features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliv er increases in graphics and ray tracing performance to enable AIdriv en upscaling.\n\nWe expanded our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of the new Versal\u2122 Series Gen 2 dev ices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptiv e SoCs, which bring preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single dev ice for end-to-end acceleration of AI-driv en embedded systems.\n\nT o execute our AI strategy, we brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to driv e dev elopment of a comprehensiv e software ecosystem spanning our  full  product  portfolio.  We  made  sev eral  key  optimizations  and  introduced  new  features  in  the  latest  AMD  ROCm\u2122  software  that  increased performance  in  key  generativ e  AI  workloads,  expanded  support  and  optimization  for  additional  frameworks  and  libraries,  and  simplified  the  ov erall developer experience. We also made strategic inv estments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate dev elopment and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has  also  dev eloped  a  software  stack  used  to  train  multiple  state-of-the-art  large  language  models  (LLMs)  on  AMD  Instinct  accelerators  that  can accelerate the dev elopment of highly-performant AMD training solutions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Office Commercial revenue was mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, along with the shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. By 2023, the description remained similar, but there was an added emphasis on AI and productivity categories, indicating that while installed base growth remained a key factor, it was now complemented by AI-driven enhancements. This evolution shows a strategic shift toward leveraging AI to augment the value of existing user growth.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from purely user base and licensing model growth in 2022 to a more feature-enhanced growth model incorporating AI in 2023, suggesting a qualitative evolution in the role of installed base growth."

Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.\n\nAdditional  information  on  our  operating  segments  and  geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n## Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur  Productivity and  Business  Processes  segment  consists  of  products  and  services  in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n- Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office  licensed  on-premises),  comprising  Office,  Exchange,  SharePoint,  Microsoft  Teams,  Office  365  Security  and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva.\n- Office  Consumer,  including  Microsoft  365  Consumer  subscriptions,  Office  licensed  on-premises,  and  other  Office services.\n- LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\n- Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.\n\n## Office Commercial\n\nOffice  Commercial  is  designed  to  increase  personal,  team,  and  organizational  productivity  through  a  range  of  products  and services.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  reach  new  users  in  new  markets  such  as  frontline  workers,  small  and  medium businesses, and growth markets, as well as add value to our core product and service offerings to span productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics,  security,  and  compliance.  Office  Commercial  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  a combination of  continued  installed  base  growth  and  average  revenue  per  user  expansion,  as  well  as  the  continued  shift  from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365.\n\n## Office Consumer\n\nOffice Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. Office Consumer Services revenue is  mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes.",

      "question": "How has the composition and growth trajectory of Windows Commercial revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its shift toward cloud services and volume licensing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was primarily driven by volume licensing of the Windows operating system and advanced security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on Software Assurance and the number of information workers in licensed enterprises. By 2023, the composition expanded to include a more pronounced focus on cloud services, as reflected in the explicit categorization of 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth' as a tracked metric. This indicates a strategic evolution toward integrating cloud-based offerings more prominently into the Windows Commercial portfolio, moving beyond traditional licensing. While specific dollar figures aren't provided, the shift is evident in how Microsoft now highlights cloud services alongside traditional volume licensing, suggesting a transformation in the revenue model with a stronger emphasis on recurring cloud-based revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, the primary drivers of Windows Commercial revenue were volume licensing and advanced security offerings, with a focus on enterprise customers and Software Assurance.",
        "In 2023, the revenue category was explicitly expanded to include cloud services as a distinct and tracked component of Windows Commercial revenue, indicating a strategic shift toward cloud integration.",
        "The evolution from a licensing-centric model to one that explicitly includes cloud services represents a transformation in the Windows Commercial revenue strategy, likely aiming to align with broader Microsoft cloud initiatives."

          "chunk_text": "PART I\n\nItem 1\n\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance ('SA'), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.\n\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings.\n\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.\n\n## Devices\n\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed  to  help  organizations,  students,  and  consumers  be  more  productive.  Growth  in  Devices  is  dependent  on  total  PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories.\n\n## Gaming\n\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated  gaming  experiences.  We  continue  to  invest  in  new  gaming  studios  and  content  to  expand  our  IP  roadmap  and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\n\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both onand off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft's Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs,  consoles,  and  mobile  devices,  enabling  gamers  to  take  their  favorite  games  with  them  and  play  on  the  device  most convenient to them.\n\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices,  and  other  devices.  Xbox  is  designed  to  benefit  users  by  providing  access  to  a  network  of  certified  applications  and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is  determined  by  the  overall  active  user  base  through  Xbox  enabled  content,  availability  of  games,  providing  exclusive  game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.\n\n## Search and News Advertising\n\nOur  Search  and  news  advertising  business  is  designed  to  deliver  relevant  search,  native,  and  display  advertising  to  a  global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search queries.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  understand  intent,  and  match  intent  with  relevant  content  and advertiser offerings.\n\nOn June 6, 2022, we acquired Xandr, Inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital advertising solutions.\n\n## Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, TXN reported nonmarketable investments at $5 million under 'Other measurement basis' with no change from 2022.",

        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from purely quantitative disclosure in 2023 to a more qualitative and risk-focused explanation in 2024, indicating a strategic change in how the company communicates exposure and valuation of these assets."

Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equiv alents, short-term inv estments and accounts receiv able. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash inv estments in inv estment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial deriv ativ e contracts to financial institutions with inv estment-grade ratings.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receiv able are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentiv es and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receiv able on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounts receiv able allowances changed to reflect amounts charged to operating results by $5 million, $3 million and $5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## 6. Valuation of debt and equity inv estments and certain liabilities\n\n## Investments measured at fair value\n\nMoney market funds, debt inv estments and mutual funds are stated at fair v alue, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. We classify all debt inv estments as av ailable-for-sale. See Fair-value considerations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&amp;E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nOur mutual funds hold a v ariety of debt and equity inv estments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair v alue of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&amp;A.\n\n## Other investments\n\nOur other inv estments include equity-method inv estments and nonmarketable inv estments, which are not measured at fair v alue. These inv estments consist of interests in v enture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Gains and losses from equity-method inv estments are recognized in OI&amp;E based on our ownership share of the inv estee's financial results. Nonmarketable securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observ able changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on nonmarketable inv estments are recognized in OI&amp;E.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments allocated just over $15 billion to capital expenditures over a 10-year period ending that year, while in 2024, the company allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures over the 10-year period ending in 2024. This represents an increase in capital expenditure allocation of approximately $5 billion. The company emphasized that increased capital expenditures are intended to support future revenue growth, which is described as becoming a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. This indicates a strategic shift toward greater investment in manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to underpin long-term free cash flow per share growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we hav e design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. In 2024, we generated $15.64 billion of rev enue.\n\nFor decades, we hav e operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from v acuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors are used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to be aliv e today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications.\n\nFor many years, we hav e run our business with three ov erarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ev er changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable and env ironmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achiev ing these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.\n\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innov ate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objectiv e and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.\n\nOur strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:\n\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitiv e advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made ov er the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitiv e adv antages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and div ersity and longev ity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitiv e advantages prov ide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitiv e adv antages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our inv estments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and lev eraging of these adv antages.\n\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&amp;D projects, dev elop new capabilities, inv est in manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Ov er a 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, we allocated $101 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation ov er this period was to driv e organic growth, which includes inv estments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inv entory. In this period, we allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures. Our increased capital expenditures are to support future rev enue growth, which will be a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to div idends and share repurchases. Div idends are designed to appeal to a broad set of inv estors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretiv e capture of future free cash flow for long-term inv estors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectiv es.\n\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striv ing for more output for ev ery dollar spent. This is about getting our inv estments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improv ement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to rev enue growth, improv ed gross margins, disciplined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth.",

By 2024, the company refined its approach by emphasizing a more precise methodology in which the selected discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value derived from the yield curve analysis. While the core method remained consistent, the 2024 filing reflects a more structured emphasis on the derivation of the equivalent rate as a direct output of the present value calculation, suggesting a refinement in transparency and analytical rigor.",

      "question": "How did IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's exposure to long-term credit risk?",
      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent ended the year at $28 million, after starting at $25 million and experiencing a small increase of $6 million through additions, offset by a $2 million reduction from other adjustments. By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments. This represents a significant decline in the noncurrent allowance over the two-year period, suggesting a reduced expectation of long-term credit losses or a strategic decision to tighten credit exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - The Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent started at $25 million and increased slightly to $28 million by the end of the year.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - The Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent started at $27 million and decreased to $19 million by the end of the year.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The allowance increased slightly in 2022 but declined significantly by 2024, indicating a notable reduction in long-term credit risk exposure or a change in credit policy."

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Current started at $418 million and increased to $467 million by the end of 2023. However, by the end of 2024, it had decreased significantly to $254 million. This indicates a transformation in IBM's credit risk exposure, with an initial increase followed by a substantial reduction in the provision for credit losses.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - The Allowance For Credit Losses - Current was $418 million at the start of 2022 and increased to $467 million by the end of the year.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) - By the end of 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Current had decreased to $254 million, reflecting a significant drop from the previous year.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change represents a transformation in credit risk exposure, with an initial increase in 2022 followed by a sharp decline in 2024."

      "answer": "The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under IBM's publicly announced program remained unchanged at $2,007,611,768 from the end of 2021 (as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing) to the end of 2024 (as disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing). This indicates that IBM did not utilize any portion of this allocated amount for share repurchases over this three-year period, suggesting a stable but unused repurchase capacity.",

        "Step 1: Identify the approximate dollar value of shares available for repurchase at the end of 2021, which is $2,007,611,768 as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Identify the same metric at the end of 2024, which remains unchanged at $2,007,611,768 as disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change (or lack thereof) in this metric to conclude that IBM's repurchase capacity remained stable but was not utilized over the three-year period."

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported amortization of purchased intangible assets at $313 million. By 2024, this figure increased significantly, driven by the acquisition of Splunk, which also contributed to a broader rise in operating expenses. As a result, operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points in 2024, partly due to the higher amortization costs. This shows that the amortization expense not only rose in dollar terms but also had a measurable effect on Cisco's profitability metrics.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, amortization of purchased intangible assets was $313 million, indicating a steady increase from prior years.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the amortization expense increased further due to the acquisition of Splunk, which also led to higher overall operating expenses and a 3.8 percentage point decline in operating income as a percentage of revenue.",
        "Step 3: The change is characterized as a significant increase in amortization expense, which had a direct negative impact on operating income margin."

In March 2024, we completed the acquisition of Splunk Inc. ('Splunk'), which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 5%. In fiscal 2024, total software revenue was $18.4 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 9%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue increased 11%, partially driven by the contribution of Splunk.\n\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we ex perienced a decline in product demand as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we saw improvement in product demand across all geographic segments and customer markets as customers largely completed the installation of their product shipments. While we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\n\nTotal  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points.  Product  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points,  largely  driven  by  favorable  product  mix , productivity benefits and benefits from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 4.4 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points driven primarily by incremental operating expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 17%, driven by a decrease of 18% in net income partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 43 million shares.\n\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.5 billion, EMEA revenue decreased by $1.0 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.7 billion. We experienced a product revenue decline in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets. Product revenue in the public sector market was flat. From a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 9% year over year, driven by a decline in revenue in Networking of 15%, partially offset by growth in Security of 32% and Observability of 27%, each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk. Product revenue grew in Collaboration by 2%.\n\nWe remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio. We believe that we are making progress on our strategic priorities.",

In March 2024, we completed the acquisition of Splunk Inc. ('Splunk'), which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 5%. In fiscal 2024, total software revenue was $18.4 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 9%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue increased 11%, partially driven by the contribution of Splunk.\n\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we ex perienced a decline in product demand as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we saw improvement in product demand across all geographic segments and customer markets as customers largely completed the installation of their product shipments. While we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\n\nTotal  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points.  Product  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points,  largely  driven  by  favorable  product  mix , productivity benefits and benefits from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 4.4 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points driven primarily by incremental operating expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 17%, driven by a decrease of 18% in net income partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 43 million shares.\n\nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.5 billion, EMEA revenue decreased by $1.0 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.7 billion. We experienced a product revenue decline in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets. Product revenue in the public sector market was flat. From a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 9% year over year, driven by a decline in revenue in Networking of 15%, partially offset by growth in Security of 32% and Observability of 27%, each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco reported total amortization of purchased intangible assets at $1,077 million, split between $749 million in cost of sales and $328 million in operating expenses. In fiscal 2024, this figure significantly increased, with the MD&A noting that higher amortization was a key driver in operating income as a percentage of revenue decreasing by 3.8 percentage points. This indicates a material rise in amortization costs, likely due to recent acquisitions such as Splunk, which also contributed $1.4 billion in revenue. The increase in amortization expense reflects Cisco's growing intangible asset base from acquisitions and its impact on financial performance.",

In March 2024, we completed the acquisition of Splunk Inc. ('Splunk'), which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 5%. In fiscal 2024, total software revenue was $18.4 billion across all product areas and services, an increase of 9%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue increased 11%, partially driven by the contribution of Splunk.\n\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we ex perienced a decline in product demand as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we saw improvement in product demand across all geographic segments and customer markets as customers largely completed the installation of their product shipments. While we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to continue to invest in key priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\n\nTotal  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points.  Product  gross  margin  increased  by  2.0  percentage  points,  largely  driven  by  favorable  product  mix , productivity benefits and benefits from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing.

In 2023, this figure increased to $19.1 billion, maintaining a 30% share of total revenues. The increase in dollar terms indicates continued investment and growth in product-based offerings, even as other segments experienced shifts.",

By 2023, the company had further integrated its collaboration portfolio with broader infrastructure modernization efforts, positioning it as a 'key component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet' and interoperable with cloud contact centers. This reflects a shift from segment-specific reporting to a more integrated, infrastructure-enabling role within Cisco's broader digital resilience strategy.",

This accounting standard update was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We do not expect this accounting standard update will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.

The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category. Effective fiscal 2022, we began  reporting  our  product  and  service  revenue  in  the  following  categories:  Secure, Agile  Networks;  Internet  for  the  Future; Collaboration;  End-to-End  Security;  Optimized Application  Experiences;  Other  Products;  and  Services.

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco indicated that if it could not enter a market timely with internally developed products, it would pursue technology purchases or licenses, or consider partnerships and acquisitions as an alternative to internal R&D. This suggests a strategic openness to acquiring intangible assets. By 2023, the company reported that amortization of purchased intangible assets had a negative 0.9% impact on product gross margin, indicating that prior acquisitions (and their associated intangible assets) had matured into a measurable financial impact. The presence of this amortization effect in 2023 reflects that Cisco had indeed pursued such acquisitions, consistent with its 2022 stated strategy, and that these acquired assets were now being amortized as part of ongoing operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, NVIDIA was placing orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, increasing financial risk from potential excess inventory.",

We  may  also  face  supply  constraints  caused  by  natural  disasters  or  other  events.  If  we  are  able  to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\n\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we  are  in  today,  we  have  placed  and  may  continue  to  place  non-cancellable  inventory  orders  in  advance  of  our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months' lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters  and  long-term  supply  and  capacity  needs.  However,  we  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict  when  such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if  there  is  a  partial  or  complete  reduction  in  long-term  demand  for  our  products  or  if  such  demand  is  served  by  our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\n\nWe  depend  on  third  parties  and  their  technology  to  manufacture,  assemble,  test,  package  or  design  our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.\n\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on  third-party  software  development  tools  to  assist  us  in  the  design,  simulation  and  verification  of  new  products  or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n- lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n- failure  by  our  foundries  or  contract  manufacturers  to  procure  raw  materials  or  to  provide  adequate  levels  of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;",

In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill. This shift suggests a transition in the nature of financial commitments associated with the segment, from acquisition-driven asset valuation to operational liabilities.",

By FY23, the segment's description expanded to explicitly include automotive platforms for infotainment systems and Omniverse Enterprise software for 3D internet applications. While exact revenue figures for FY23 are not provided, the inclusion of these new areas indicates an effort to diversify the revenue mix and extend the Graphics segment's role into emerging markets such as automotive and enterprise 3D applications.",

Gamers  and  others  are  therefore  able  to  mine cryptocurrency  using  our  GPUs,  although  we  have  limited  visibility  into  how  much  this  impacts  our  overall  GPU demand.  Volatility  in  the  cryptocurrency  market,  including  changes  in  the  prices  of  cryptocurrencies  or  method  of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.\n\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training  and  inference  for  cloud  computing  and AI  workloads  such  as  natural  language  processing  and deep recommender models.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering.\n\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue.\n\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year.\n\nRevenue  for  our  CMP  products  declined  significantly  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2022.  We  are  unable  to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.\n\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\n\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\n\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\n\n## Market Platform Highlights\n\nAt  our  November  2021  GPU  Technology  Conference,  we  announced  general  availability  of  NVIDIA  Omniverse Enterprise;  65  new  and  updated  software  development  kits,  including  NVIDIA  Riva,  Modulus,  ReOpt,  Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara Holoscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI and autonomous machines.\n\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\n\nIn  our  Data  Center  platform,  we  launched  new  NVIDIA A30  and A10  GPUs  for  mainstream AI,  data  analytics  and graphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our first Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to addressing the global climate change crisis.\n\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop workstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual worlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.",

Our customers primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM  channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## A Year in Rev iew\n\n2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

Our customers primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM  channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## A Year in Rev iew\n\n2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, Intel faced competitive pressures in DCAI due to hyperscaler dominance, internal chip development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware, which eroded its competitive position and negatively impacted revenue.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Intel shifted its DCAI strategy by focusing on high core count server products that increased ASPs, despite lower volume, leading to a 1% revenue increase in DCAI.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change represents a strategic evolution from a weakened competitive position in 2023 to a targeted product differentiation approach in 2024, supported by operational restructuring and internal foundry model changes, which reversed the negative revenue trend."

In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by competitive pressures, particularly from GPU-based solutions, which led to reduced ASPs and market share.",

Our customers primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM  channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## A Year in Rev iew\n\n2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets.

In 2023, the increase was attributed to cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and foreign currency weakness.

In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",

Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The Company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various ty pes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy , information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to  customers. A ny  failure  by  the  Company  to  comply  with  these  public  statements  or  with  federal,  state  or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy , security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow pay ment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the  Company's ability  to  manage  product  quality  and  warranty  costs  effectively;  shifts  in  the  mix  of  products  and  services,  or  in  the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service  introductions,  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions,  or  failure  of  one  of  the  Company's  logistics,  supply  or  manufacturing partners.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel highlighted that widespread shortages of substrates and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity were limiting its ability to meet customer demand, particularly in the PSG, CCG, and DCG businesses. The company had entered into long-term purchase commitments and prepayments to secure supply. By 2023, while substrate and foundry capacity shortages remained a challenge, Intel faced additional supply chain pressures from macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as new regulatory expectations around responsible sourcing. The company noted that these broader disruptions made predicting future impacts increasingly difficult and continued to affect product quantities and customer demand.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Intel identified substrate and foundry capacity shortages as key constraints on product quantities, particularly for PSG, CCG, and DCG businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "- increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.\n\nThese and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that such shortages will continue in 2022. These shortages have limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our PSG products, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCG businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these ongoing shortages.\n\nTo obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have increasingly entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements could still prove inadequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of these arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable.\n\nWe utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of thirdparty foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties.\n\nWhere possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\n\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n\n- writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n- recalling products that have been shipped;\n- providing product replacements or modifications;\n- providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;\n- defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n- paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.",

By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",

Our allocation decisions are driven by our priorities to invest in the business, acquire and integrate businesses that complement our strategic objectives, and return cash to stockholders. As we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy, our allocation priorities will shift more heavily toward investing in the business and away from share repurchases, as we plan our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our process technology roadmap. We will continue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions and intend to maintain our dividend.\n\n## Cash from Operating Activities $B\n\n## Our Financial Capital Allocation Decisions Are Driven by Three Priorities\n\n## Invest in the Business\n\nOur first allocation priority is to invest in R&amp;D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. We expect to increase our R&amp;D investment and our capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy.\n\n## Acquire and Integrate\n\nOur second allocation priority is to invest in and acquire companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that supplement and strengthen our capital and R&amp;D investments. Our key acquisitions over the last three years include our 2020 acquisition of Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's mobility-as-a-service offering and our 2019 acquisition of Habana Labs to strengthen and extend the reach of our AI portfolio.\n\nWe take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities, and subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end, we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business. Additionally, in 2020 we completed the divestiture of the majority of Home Gateway Platform, a division of CCG, and in 2019 we divested the majority of our smartphone modem business.\n\n## Return Cash to Stockholders\n\nOur third allocation priority is to return cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.\n\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- 2021 capital investments in Memory are not presented due to the divestiture of the NAND memory business announced in October 2020. 2017-2020 capital investments presented include Memory. 2\n\nOur Capital",

We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19.

NonGAAP revenue excludes NSG.\n\nHigher gross margin from higher platform and adjacent revenue and Corporate revenue from a prepaid customer supply agreement, partially offset by a Corporate charge related to VLSI litigation, higher period charges from ramp of process technology, and higher operating expenses on increased R&amp;D investment. Non-GAAP operating income incrementally excludes, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring and the charge related to VLSI litigation. 1\n\n## GAAP\n\nnon-GAAP\n\n2\n\nDiluted EPS down $0.08 or 2% from 2020\n\nDiluted EPS up $0.37 or 7% from 2020\n\nLower operating income partially offset by equity investment gains, lower effective tax rate, and lower shares. Non-GAAP results incrementally exclude ongoing mark-to-market adjustments and tax impacts of non-GAAP adjustments.\n\nGAAP\n\nnon-GAAP 2\n\nOperating cash flow down $5.4B or 15%\n\nFree cash flow down $9.9B or 47%\n\nLower operating cash flow driven by a decrease in net working capital contributions and cash paid to settle a prepaid customer supply agreement in Q1 2021, partially offset by a McAfee special dividend received in Q3 2021. Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.\n\n## Investing in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term\n\nTo support our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are making significant capital investments to increase our manufacturing capacity and accelerate our process technology roadmap, as well as increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

      "question": "How did Intel's relationship with its NAND memory business evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what impact did this have on its financial performance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Intel directly disclosed financial losses from the NAND memory business, including a net revenue loss of $4,306 million and a negative impact of $1,369 million on operating income.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Intel referenced the completed sale of the NAND memory business to SK hynix as part of its strategic restructuring efforts, indicating that the business was no longer part of Intel's operations.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a strategic discontinuation of the NAND memory business, transitioning from an operational segment to a fully divested asset, which removed a consistent financial burden and aligned with Intel's new strategic direction."

      "answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, decreased by $122 million, and concluded at $577 million. This indicates a shift from an increasing trend in inventory risk provisions in 2023 to a reduction in 2024, suggesting improved inventory risk management or a strategic adjustment in provisioning.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million and ended at $658 million, showing an increase of $201 million during the year.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Allowance For Inventory Losses began at $658 million and ended at $577 million, reflecting a decrease of $122 million during the year.",
        "Step 3: The change from an increase in 2023 to a decrease in 2024 indicates a transformation in inventory risk provisioning, suggesting a shift in inventory management strategy or reduced exposure to inventory losses."

      "question": "How did IBM's characterization of its relationship with client spending budgets evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this suggest about its perception of dependency on external economic conditions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, IBM described its relationship with client spending budgets as one of dependency, indicating that a downturn in economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns could directly impact its business. By 2024, the language shifted to describe client spending budgets as something that 'impacts' the business, rather than a dependency. This subtle shift suggests that while IBM still acknowledges sensitivity to client spending, it may be framing its exposure as more external and less core to its strategic control, potentially signaling a repositioning of how it communicates risk related to economic conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, IBM used the phrase 'Depends_On' to describe its relationship with client spending budgets, indicating a direct dependency.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, IBM used the phrase 'Impacted_By' to describe the same relationship, suggesting influence but not direct dependency.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from 'Depends_On' to 'Impacted_By' reflects a nuanced change in how IBM portrays its exposure to client spending, possibly indicating a strategic effort to communicate reduced vulnerability to external economic fluctuations."

If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.\n\nDamage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. IBM's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners.

      "answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that cybersecurity incidents could directly lead to the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to brand reputation due to increased exposure to liability, litigation, and regulatory actions. The filing emphasized the growing risk of cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the industry and their potential to disrupt customer operations or damage trust in IBM\u2019s services. By 2024, while cybersecurity remained a concern, the focus shifted to broader reputational risks tied to brand image, including how negative perceptions could impact the ability to attract and retain customers, talent, and ecosystem partners. This indicates a more strategic framing of customer acquisition risks, extending beyond cybersecurity to include overall brand strength and market perception.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift from a narrow, threat-based view of customer acquisition risk (cybersecurity) to a broader, brand-centric perspective that encompasses but is not limited to security concerns."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompany's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas, including AI and generative AI, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Divestitures Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption or Retention of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and divestitures. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully, that strategic objectives will be achieved or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. With respect to acquisitions and alliances, the related risks include the company failing to achieve anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key personnel or strategic relationships of acquired companies, the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, and delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company divests or attempts to divest assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such transaction is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such divestitures, risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control, and delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, necessary governmental or regulatory approvals, as well as the failure to close planned transactions.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact the company's financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities\n\nThe Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an ex tended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flex ibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.\n\nThe Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful.\n\nThe Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities\n\nRisk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in ex change rates, ex change controls, governmental and stock ex change regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors.' There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\n\nThe company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled 'Risk Factors,' as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.\n\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Accenture reported Total New Bookings of $72.2 billion, which increased to $81.2 billion in 2024, representing a 13% growth in U.S. dollars. This consistent growth rate suggests that Accenture maintained strong sales momentum during this period. The company's ability to sustain a double-digit growth rate indicates effective execution of its sales strategies and a strong market position in both the consulting and managed services segments, which are key drivers of its business. This trajectory implies that Accenture was able to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain client demand across its core service lines.",

Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the  hardware  product.  Invoices  for  license  support  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  generally  invoiced  annually  in  advance. Cloud  SaaS  and  cloud  infrastructure  contracts  are  generally  invoiced  annually,  quarterly  or  monthly  in  advance.  Services  are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division.

We  recognize  revenue  ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period.

      "answer": "Oracle's cloud and on-premise license revenue declined from $5,878 million in 2022 to $5,081 million in 2024, indicating a consistent downward trend. This suggests that Oracle's traditional license segment is shrinking, likely as a result of increased customer migration toward Oracle's cloud services, which saw growth in both cloud services and license support. The sustained decline implies a strategic shift in Oracle's business model from perpetual licenses to cloud-based offerings, aligning with broader industry trends.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Oracle reported $5,878 million in cloud and on-premise license revenue, indicating a relatively strong base in traditional software licensing.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, this figure had decreased to $5,081 million, continuing a downward trajectory from $5,779 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: The consistent decline across both years indicates a structural shift in Oracle's business, moving away from perpetual licenses toward cloud-based services, which saw revenue growth from $30,174 million in 2022 to $39,383 million in 2024 in the cloud services and license support segment."

For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI offering that utilizes machine learning capabilities. After an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit  from  our  offerings,  research  and  development  efforts  and  deep  IT  expertise  by  electing  to  purchase  and  renew  Oracle support  offerings  for  their  license  and  hardware  deployments,  which  may  include  product  enhancements  that  we  periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us.\n\nOur  selective  and  active  acquisition  program  is  another  important  element  of  our  corporate  strategy.  We  believe  that  our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings, including our acquisition of Cerner Corporation in June 2022 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  for  additional  information).  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\n\nWe have three businesses, cloud and license, hardware, and services, and each is comprised of a single operating segment. Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments.\n\nOracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Recent Global Events\n\nOracle  withdrew  its  operations  from  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  Republic  of  Belarus  in  March  2022.  Neither  of  the aforementioned countries, nor Ukraine, have composed or are expected to compose a material portion of Oracle's total consolidated revenues, net income, net assets, or workforce. Our business was also affected by the impacts of COVID-19 during the fiscal 2022 and 2021 periods presented in this Annual Report. For additional discussion of these matters and their impacts to Oracle, and a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, each of which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\n## Oracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies\n\nOracle's  comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization's  IT environment needs including business process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle technologies  are  based  upon  industry  standards  and  are  designed  to  be  enterprise-grade,  reliable,  scalable  and  secure.  Oracle applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  including  database  and  middleware  software  as  well  as  enterprise  applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services are the building blocks of  Oracle  Cloud  Services,  our  partners'  cloud  services,  and  our  customers'  cloud  IT  environments.  Oracle  applications  and infrastructure offerings are marketed and sold through our cloud and license, hardware, and services businesses and are delivered through the Oracle Cloud, or through other IT deployment models including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments. We believe  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  enable  flexibility,  interoperability  and  choice  to  best  meet  customer  IT needs.\n\nWe believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offerings are opportunities for us to continue to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasingly recognize the value of access to the latest versions of Oracle cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable services model that Oracle provisions, manages, upgrades and maintains on our customers' behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our Oracle SaaS and OCI offerings  together  to  help  new  and  existing  customers  migrate  their  extensive  installed  base  of  on-premise  and  cloud-based applications and infrastructure",

The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable  to  growth  in  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  revenues  and  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models. Customers also renewed  their  related  cloud  contracts  and  license  support  contracts  to  continue  to  gain  access  to  the  latest  versions  of  our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency increase in our services business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 68%, 22% and 10%, respectively, to our total revenue growth during fiscal 2022.\n\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal  2021  substantially  due  to  certain  litigation  related  charges  recorded  to  acquisition  related  and  other  expenses  as  further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, our total operating  expenses  increased  due  to  higher  cloud  services  and  license  support  expenses,  which  were  primarily  due  to  higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business' revenues; higher services expenses, which increased primarily due to higher employee related and external contractor expenses; and higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower restructuring expenses and by $250 million of gains from operating asset sales, which were allocated across most of our operating expense lines during fiscal 2022.

      "answer": "Oracle's cloud license and on-premise license revenue decreased from $5,878 million in fiscal 2022 to $5,081 million in fiscal 2024. This indicates a strategic shift towards cloud services and subscription-based offerings, as evidenced by the consistent growth in cloud services and license support revenues over the same period, which reached $39,383 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $30,174 million in fiscal 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In fiscal 2022, Oracle reported $5,878 million in cloud license and on-premise license revenue, indicating a continued emphasis on traditional licensing models.",
        "Step 2: By fiscal 2024, this figure had declined to $5,081 million, while cloud services and license support revenues grew significantly to $39,383 million, up from $30,174 million in fiscal 2022.",
        "Step 3: The decline in licensing revenue, paired with strong growth in cloud services, suggests a strategic pivot toward cloud-based offerings and away from traditional perpetual licenses."

Oracle  Cloud  Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the  contractual  period  of  the  cloud  contract  or,  in  the  case  of  usage  model  contracts,  as  the  cloud  services  are consumed over time.\n\n- Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues,  which  include  revenues  from  the  licensing  of  our  software  products including  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database,  Oracle  Middleware  and  Java,  among  others,  which  our  customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is  made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\n\nProviding  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  as  to  when  and  how  they  deploy  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure technologies  are  important  elements  of  our  corporate  strategy.  In  recent  periods,  customer  demand  for  our  applications  and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71% of our total revenues during each of fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 70% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020.\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business'  revenue  growth  is  affected  by  many  factors,  including  the  strength  of  general  economic  and business  conditions;  governmental  budgetary  constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract  base;  substantially  all  customers  continuing  to  purchase  license  support  contracts  in  connection  with  their  license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\n- expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and\n- continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.\n\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business' total revenues, which should enable us  to  continue  to  make  investments  in  research  and  development  and  our  cloud  operations  to  develop,  improve,  increase  the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n\nOur cloud and license business' margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",

Changes to the Company's business practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively  impact  the reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the Company's products and services, and result in  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data  and  biometric  data.  Health  data  and  financial  data  are  subject  to  additional  privacy,  security  and  breach  notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased  competition;  the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  other  macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions,  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions,  or  failure  of  one  of  the  Company's  logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.",

In the 2023 filing, Apple maintained that potential penalties include 'significant fees or fines,' but added that the company could also experience a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards.'

          "chunk_text": "There can be no assurance the Company's business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively  impact  the reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the Company's products and services, and result in  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data  and  biometric  data.  Health  data  and  financial  data  are  subject  to  additional  privacy,  security  and  breach  notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels.

By 2024, the risk profile evolved, with more specific concerns raised around underestimating costs or overestimating future revenues or margins, and the possibility that these investments may not generate material returns for many years. Additionally, 2024 introduced heightened emphasis on potential negative outcomes such as incurring significant costs, asset impairments, and the risk of flat or declining revenues and margins if new technologies fail to succeed within anticipated timeframes.

          "chunk_text": "## Risk Factors Summary:\n\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' of this Annual Report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES\n\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES\n\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\n\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n- We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS\n\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.\n- Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGES\n\n- Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.",

          "chunk_text": "successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from, these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.\n\nFor example, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs. Additionally, certain customers have adopted, and other customers may adopt, policies that require us to achieve certain sustainability, climate or other environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related targets, such as our 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment and our interim GHG emissions reduction goals. If we fail to achieve ESG-related targets that meet our customers' requirements or expectations, these customers may not purchase products or services from us.\n\nIf our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality or regulatory standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry) or other standards (including sustainability or other ESG-related standards) of a particular industry or application, we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.\n\nIn addition, in order to successfully ex tend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.\n\nIf we are not successful in ex tending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.\n\n## We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.\n\nWe engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies, supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and furthering our growth and diversification strategy in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities arising as a result of litigation, that are not covered by any indemnification protection that we may obtain. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.",

('Broadcom'), a Delaware corporation, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology ('IT') environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and i nfrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53,398 million. VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of VMware commencing on November 22, 2023. See Note 4. 'Acquisitions' for additional information.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') was a 53-week fiscal year, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023') and fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, we completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock through the filing of an amendment ('Amendment') to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amendment proportionately increased the number of shares of our authorized common stock without changing the par value of $0.001 per share. All share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders' equity balances presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Semiconductor Solutions Segment operated under supply chain constraints, particularly for wafers and substrates, while experiencing robust profitability due to supply imbalances. The segment was primarily focused on a broad range of semiconductor devices used in enterprise and data center networking, among other applications. During this time, Broadcom announced its intent to acquire VMware for approximately $61 billion, signaling a major strategic move into infrastructure software, though the direct integration of VMware into the semiconductor business had not yet occurred. By fiscal year 2024, the Semiconductor Solutions Segment had placed an increased emphasis on AI networking and connectivity, aligning with broader market trends. The VMware acquisition, completed during this period, expanded Broadcom\u2019s infrastructure capabilities and likely influenced the segment\u2019s strategic direction by integrating advanced software-defined networking and cloud technologies. This integration supported a more comprehensive approach to data center and AI networking solutions, enhancing the semiconductor offerings with software-driven value. The 2024 segment description also reflects a more integrated and strategic view of semiconductor and software solutions, indicating a transformation in how the Semiconductor Solutions Segment contributes to Broadcom\u2019s broader infrastructure ecosystem.",

We continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Although supply lead times have stabilized, we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet demand.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies from time to time.\n\nOur ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods.\n\n## Fiscal Year Highlights\n\nHighlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following:\n\n- We generated $16,736 million of cash from operations.\n- We paid $7,032 million in cash dividends.\n- We repurchased $7,000 million of common stock.\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit ('RSU') awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption 'Risk Factors' or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') compared to our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'). A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fi s cal year 2023 compared to our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') on December 14, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product l i nes  and intellectual property ('IP') licensing. Our infrastructure software segment includes our private and hybrid cloud, application development and delivery, software-defined edge, application networking and security, mainframe, distributed and cybersecurity solutions, and our FC SAN business.\n\nOur fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year compared to our fiscal year 2023, which was a 52-week fiscal year. The additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 resulted in higher net revenue, gross margin dollars, research and development expense, and selling general and administrative expense for fi s cal year 2024, compared to the corresponding prior year fiscal period.\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:\n\n- gain or loss of significant customers;\n- general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete;\n- anticipated or actual demand for AI-related products;\n- our distributors' product inventory and end customer demand;\n- the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, including our AI related products, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets;\n- the shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; and\n- the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.",

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Broadcom,' 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. We have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and i nfrastructure software. See Note 13. 'Segment Information' for additional information.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53,398 million. VMware was a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We acquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of VMware commencing on November 22, 2023. See Note 4. 'Acquisitions' for additional information.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') was a 53-week fiscal year, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023') and fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 ('fiscal year 2022') were both 52-week fiscal years.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, we completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock through the filing of an amendment ('Amendment') to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amendment proportionately increased the number of shares of our authorized common stock without changing the par value of $0.001 per share. All share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders' equity balances presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency assets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\n\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.\n\n## BROADCOM INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was primarily a recipient of internal capital allocation through business acquisitions, with $110 million allocated to intangible assets from acquisitions completed during that year. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly, with the segment being explicitly positioned as a strategic pillar of the company's broader infrastructure technology offerings. The 2024 report highlights the segment's expanded role in supporting hybrid cloud environments, cybersecurity, and AI networking, indicating a shift from a focus on acquisition-driven growth to strategic integration and market leadership emphasis.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption 'Risk Factors' or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended November 3, 2024 ('fiscal year 2024') compared to our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'). A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fi s cal year 2023 compared to our fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') on December 14, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence ('AI') networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking ('FC SAN') products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product l i nes  and intellectual property ('IP') licensing. Our infrastructure software segment includes our private and hybrid cloud, application development and delivery, software-defined edge, application networking and security, mainframe, distributed and cybersecurity solutions, and our FC SAN business.\n\nOur fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year compared to our fiscal year 2023, which was a 52-week fiscal year. The additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 resulted in higher net revenue, gross margin dollars, research and development expense, and selling general and administrative expense for fi s cal year 2024, compared to the corresponding prior year fiscal period.\n\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world's leading business and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology market l eadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.\n\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:\n\n- gain or loss of significant customers;\n- general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete;\n- anticipated or actual demand for AI-related products;\n- our distributors' product inventory and end customer demand;\n- the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, including our AI related products, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets;\n- the shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; and\n- the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.",

However, by 2024, subscription revenue had declined significantly as a percentage of total revenue to just 8%. This dramatic decrease indicates a major shift in Adobe's revenue mix, suggesting a growing proportion of revenue coming from non-subscription sources such as services and other revenue streams.",

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

Within  each  geographic  region,  the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.\n\nIncluded in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During fiscal 2021, the U.S. Dollar primarily weakened against EMEA currencies and the Australian Dollar as compared to fiscal 2020, which increased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents by $276 million. During fiscal 2021, the foreign currency impacts to revenue were offset in part by net hedging losses from our cash flow hedging program of $18 million.\n\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of revenue by geography.\n\n## Cost of Revenue\n\n",

      "question": "How has Apple's exposure to potential fees or fines related to payment card data security standards evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what implications does this have for its financial risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, Apple acknowledged the risk of significant fees or fines due to payment card data security standards noncompliance, with potential impacts on transaction costs and processing capabilities.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, Apple reiterated the same core risk but expanded the consequences to include broader financial and reputational impacts, suggesting a more severe risk profile.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The evolution reflects a transformation in how Apple communicates its exposure to fees or fines related to payment card data, shifting toward a more severe and comprehensive risk characterization."

Changes to the Company's business practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively  impact  the reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the Company's products and services, and result in  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation,  loss  of  competitive  advantage,  poor  market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\n## The  Company's  business  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws,  rules,  policies  and  other  obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data  and  biometric  data.  Health  data  and  financial  data  are  subject  to  additional  privacy,  security  and  breach  notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations.  If  the  Company  fails  to  adequately  comply  with  these  rules  and  requirements,  or  if  health  data  or  financial  data  is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company's agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company's products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company's gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in  response  to  such  pressures;  increased  competition;  the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its  product  and  service  offerings;  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  other  macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand  for  that  product  could  significantly  impact  quarterly  net  sales.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products or services, issues with new product or service introductions,  information  technology  system  failures  or  network  disruptions,  or  failure  of  one  of  the  Company's  logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.",

In  estimating  inventory  carrying  value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements,  and  product  life  cycles.  These  significant  assumptions  are  forward-looking  and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including  the  basis  for  developing  the  above-described  assumptions  and  management's judgments.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management's key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used  to  determine  the  amount  of  inventory  carrying  value  adjustments.  For  instance,  we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales,  both historical  and  forecasted,  assessed  the  reasonableness  of  management's  estimates  of  future sales  prices  by  analyzing  historical  sales  and  evaluating  any  factors  that  may  impact  sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management's adjustments to such sales  forecasts  by  analyzing  potential  technological  changes  in  line  with  product  life  cycles and/or  identified  alternative  customer  uses.

However, in 2023, the FDII tax benefit was $185 million, contributing to a significantly larger income tax benefit of $346 million. This indicates that the FDII tax benefit increased from $147 million in 2021 to $185 million in 2023, positively impacting AMD's tax position year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax , contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.

      "answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments used a discount rate of 2.74% to determine U.S. Defined Benefit obligations as of 2021, which reflects the company's assumption for valuing future liabilities. By 2024, the company's projected benefit payments for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan show a declining trend, with payments expected to decrease from $80 million in 2025 to $54 million in 2029, before increasing slightly in the 2030-2034 period. This suggests a strategic shift toward a more conservative outlook on pension liabilities, as the lower discount rate in 2022 would have increased the present value of long-term obligations, yet the projected payments show a decreasing trend over time. This evolution indicates a more controlled and reduced future liability profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the discount rate used for U.S. Defined Benefit obligations was 2.74% for 2021, indicating the company's valuation assumption for long-term liabilities.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company projected decreasing U.S. Defined Benefit payments from $80 million in 2025 to $54 million in 2029, showing a deliberate reduction in future benefit outflows.",
        "Step 3: The combination of a lower discount rate (increasing liability valuation) and reduced future payments suggests a strategic evolution in how the company is managing its pension obligations\u2014potentially to reduce long-term risk exposure."

Although supply lead times have stabilized, we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet demand.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies from time to time.\n\nOur ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods.\n\n## Fiscal Year Highlights\n\nHighlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following:\n\n- We generated $16,736 million of cash from operations.\n- We paid $7,032 million in cash dividends.\n- We repurchased $7,000 million of common stock.\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit ('RSU') awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.\n\n## Net Revenue\n\nA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms.\n\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom reported semiconductor revenue as a core part of its business, with supply chain constraints impacting the ability to meet demand. By fiscal year 2023, the company had formalized multi-year customer contracts in the Semiconductor Solutions Segment, resulting in remaining performance obligations of approximately $20.5 billion as of November 3, 2024, with 43% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. This represents a shift from a demand-constrained environment to one with more structured, long-term revenue commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Broadcom's semiconductor business was marked by supply constraints and uncertainty about demand sustainability, as noted in the 10-K filing.",
        "In 2023, following the VMware acquisition, Broadcom disclosed multi-year contracts in the Semiconductor Solutions Segment with $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations, indicating a more stable and committed customer base.",
        "The evolution from supply-driven volatility in 2022 to structured contractual revenue in 2023 shows a strategic shift toward securing long-term semiconductor business commitments."

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm highlighted general risks associated with defective inventory, including costs from recalls, repairs, or write-downs due to product defects, errors, or security vulnerabilities. However, in 2023, the company specifically expanded its disclosure to emphasize the financial impact of defective inventory in the context of automotive industry recalls. The 2023 filing explicitly mentions Qualcomm's participation in customer recalls, particularly in the automotive sector, signaling a more targeted and heightened concern around defective inventory write-downs tied to this critical market. This evolution reflects an increased awareness or exposure to automotive-related financial risks stemming from product defects.",

In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.\n\nThe use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers' businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers' devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information .'\n\nOur products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers' products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our customers' IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.\n\nIn addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating to our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles, including ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.",

By the end of fiscal 2023 (September 24, 2023), the QCT segment balance increased to $9,909 million, and further adjustments during the following period brought the balance to $10,065 million by September 29, 2024.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we finalized and adjusted the valuation of the Non-Arriver businesses by $229 million and recorded an offsetting adjustment to decrease goodwill for this amount. The Non-Arriver businesses' assets are not available to be used to settle our obligations, and the Non-Arriver businesses' creditors do not have recourse to us. SSW Partners owns and operates the Non-Arriver businesses, and its funding of the purchase price for Veoneer was recorded as a component of held for sale liabilities. The underlying classes of assets and liabilities held for sale have not been presented because such amounts are not material.\n\nGoodwill related to this transaction was allocated to our QCT segment, and $471 million of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and certain synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Completed technology-based intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average useful life of nine years. IPR&amp;D relates to a single project that is expected to be completed in fiscal 2025. Upon completion, we expect the IPR&amp;D to be amortized over its useful life of seven years. We valued the completed technology and IPR&amp;D using an income approach based on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nSince the Closing Date, the operating results of the Arriver and Non-Arriver businesses were initially reported on a one quarter lag. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we eliminated the one-quarter reporting lag previously used to consolidate the Arriver business to provide contemporaneous reporting within our consolidated financial statements, which we believe is preferable. The effect of this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of eliminating the one quarter reporting lag has been included in our operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Non-Arriver businesses are presented as discontinued operations and remain on a one quarter reporting lag. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations. The cash flows generated from (used by) the Non-Arriver businesses are reflected as discontinued operations and are classified as operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Investing and financing activities from discontinued operations reported in fiscal 2022 were not material.\n\nOther. During fiscal 2022, we acquired eight other businesses for a total accounting purchase price of $792 million. We recognized $202 million of intangible assets (which primarily relate to completed technology) that will be amortized on a straightline basis over a weighted-average useful life of six years.

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM's Revenue Based Provisions started the year at $435 million, with additions of $620 million and write-offs of $629 million, resulting in an ending balance of $424 million. In 2023, the provisions began at $424 million, with additions increasing to $500 million and write-offs at $456 million, leading to an ending balance of $480 million. This indicates that IBM increased its provisions over the period, suggesting a more conservative approach or higher anticipated liabilities related to revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2022, IBM noted that new customers contributed to the unpredictability of financial results, citing factors such as new markets, evolving competitors, and the structure of product and service contracts. By 2023, the company added specificity by highlighting that services contracts with new commercial customers in regulated industries were subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on regulatory scrutiny as a distinct financial risk factor tied to new customer engagements in sensitive sectors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, IBM described new customers as a source of financial unpredictability, linked to new markets, evolving competitors, and contract structures.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, IBM expanded this risk by specifying that services contracts with new commercial customers in regulated industries were subject to regulatory review regarding controls and processes.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change reflects a shift from general unpredictability tied to new customers to a more specific focus on regulatory risks in contracts with new customers in regulated sectors."

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

      "answer": "Broadcom's strategic positioning in the Infrastructure Software Segment significantly evolved from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the company completed the transformative acquisition of VMware for approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock, with a total fair value of $53.4 billion. This acquisition marked a major expansion into infrastructure software. However, in 2024, Broadcom divested VMware's End-User Computing (EUC) business to KKR & Co. Inc. for $3.5 billion in cash, signaling a strategic shift to focus on core infrastructure software assets while shedding non-core components.",

This acquisition included both cash and Broadcom common stock, and it involved the assumption of VMware's outstanding RSU awards and $8.25 billion in senior unsecured notes. However, in 2024, Broadcom refocused on its semiconductor strategy by divesting VMware's EUC business to KKR & Co. Inc. for $3.5 billion and acquiring Seagate's SoC operations for $600 million. The Seagate acquisition specifically aimed at strengthening Broadcom\u2019s portfolio of System-on-Chip products within the Semiconductor Solutions Segment, indicating a strategic pivot back toward semiconductor leadership.",

By fiscal 2023, the year-over-year increase in Document Cloud revenue had slowed to $316 million, or 13%, from $2.38 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.70 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nwith  the  science  of  our  Digital  Experience  business,  we  help  our  customers  to  more  efficiently  and  effectively  make,  manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\n\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners,  including  marketing  agencies,  systems  integrators  and  independent  software  vendors  that  help  license  and  deploy  our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, Adobe reported that Digital Media revenue growth in fiscal 2021 (compared to fiscal 2020) was driven by $2.29 billion in increases from Creative and Document Cloud offerings. Specifically, Creative Cloud revenue growth was attributed to net new subscriptions, while Document Cloud revenue grew due to increased subscription revenue from Acrobat and Adobe Sign. In contrast, the 2023 10-K filing disclosed a shift in reporting by providing a comparative revenue breakdown across fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 for major Digital Media offerings, indicating a more structured and retrospective presentation of revenue composition. This evolution in reporting suggests Adobe placed greater emphasis on transparency around the performance of its core Digital Media offerings over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted that many of its consulting contracts were less than 12 months in duration and could be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing a risk to revenue predictability. Additionally, the company noted that delays or reductions in client spending\u2014especially under existing contracts\u2014could materially affect results, particularly in geographic markets or service lines where a small number of clients contributed significantly to revenue. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had evolved to emphasize broader operational vulnerabilities, including global disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures. These risks, combined with Accenture's global delivery model's concentration in India and the Philippines, introduced new layers of unpredictability in maintaining consistent client spending and service delivery. While contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded the risk profile to include external macro-operational factors, indicating a shift in how client spending volatility could impact the company.",

          "chunk_text": "Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. Many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. Additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly soughtafter skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utilization rate is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead",

We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition. A dditionally, further indebtedness may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing.\n\n## Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and results of operations, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in M anagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under 'Critical A ccounting Policies and Estimates.' We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\n## As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our strategy to continue to grow in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.\n\nWe have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 52 countries around the world. One aspect of our strategy is to continue to grow in our key markets around the world. Our strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and strategy, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\n\nHealth emergencies or pandemics; acts of terrorist violence; political, social and civil unrest; regional and international war and other hostilities and international responses to these wars and hostilities; natural disasters, sea level rise, floods, droughts and water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and storms, occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change; or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us. These events could adversely affect our clients' levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty  of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified people, these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security incidents involving, our facilities or systems, or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other A ccenture locations and people, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.\n\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capability. While our delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India and the Philippines, where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located, respectively. In addition, certain of our clients and markets are primarily supported by individual delivery centers. Concentrating our delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those discussed in this risk factor, many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by increasing geopolitical tensions. While these events have not materially impacted our ability to deliver services to our clients, international conflicts are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future.\n\nWe are unable to protect our people, facilities and systems, and those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers and clients, against all such events. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic",

      "question": "How has Accenture's equity allocation strategy for defined benefit pension plans changed between 2022 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about its approach to balancing long-term capital appreciation with risk management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Accenture's defined benefit pension plans had a weighted-average equity allocation of 50% as of August 31, 2022, reflecting a strategy that emphasized long term capital appreciation through a significant exposure to equities. By 2024, this allocation had decreased to 40% as of August 31, 2024, indicating a more conservative posture. This shift suggests a recalibration of the company\u2019s approach to balance capital growth with mitigating asset volatility, especially in light of changing market conditions and liability durations. The company continues to diversify equities between U.S. and non-U.S. index funds to support long term capital appreciation, but with a reduced overall exposure to equity markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the weighted-average equity allocation was 50%, emphasizing long term capital appreciation.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the weighted-average equity allocation dropped to 40%, indicating a reduced emphasis on equities.",
        "Step 3: The decrease in equity allocation from 50% to 40% reflects a strategic shift toward a more risk-averse posture while still maintaining a component of long term capital appreciation through diversified equity investments."
