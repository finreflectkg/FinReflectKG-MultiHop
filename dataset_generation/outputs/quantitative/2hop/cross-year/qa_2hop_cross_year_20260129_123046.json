          "chunk_text": "## Net Product Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Provisions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are received; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\n\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health care professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of consolidated revenue. Further, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 28 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\n\n## Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- We initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we must estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\n- The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value approach.\n- The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rebates related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.\n- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021, total debt was $16.88 billion, an increase of $289.4 million compared with $16.60 billion at December 31, 2020. In September 2021, we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of \u20ac500.0 million of 1.125 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2051 and \u20ac700.0 million of 1.375 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2061, with interest to be paid annually, and British pound-denominated notes consisting of \u00a3250.0 million of 1.625 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2043, with interest to be paid annually. We paid $1.91 billion of the net cash proceeds from the offering to purchase and redeem certain higher interest rate U.S. dollar-denominated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion. We used the remaining net proceeds from the offering to prefund certain 2022 debt maturities and for general corporate purposes. In addition, in September 2021, we issued euro-denominated notes consisting of \u20ac600.0 million of 0.50 percent fixed-rate notes due in September 2033, with interest to be paid annually. The net proceeds from the offering will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible projects designed to advance one or more of our environmental, social, and governance objectives. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $5.26 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund any short-term borrowing needs.\n\nFor the 136 consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. Dividends of $3.40 per share and $2.96 per share were paid in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2021, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2022, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.98 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2022 of $3.92 per share. th\n\nCapital expenditures of $1.31 billion during 2021, compared to $1.39 billion in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, we repurchased $1.00 billion of shares, which completed our $8.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in June 2018. Additionally, our board authorized a $5.00 billion share repurchase program in May 2021. In 2021, we repurchased $250.0 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.75 billion remaining under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSee \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Patent Matters\" for information regarding recent and upcoming losses of patent protection.\n\nBoth domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels.\n\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.\n\nOur primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 13 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2021 and 2020, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a one-year period.",

In fiscal year 2024, the Renal Care Solutions business was moved out of Medical Surgical and into the 'Other' line within the company's new reporting structure.

      "question": "How has AbbVie's treatment of business valuation costs in relation to business combinations evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their acquisition strategy or accounting practices?",
      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, AbbVie consistently expensed business valuation costs as incurred in connection with business combinations. However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the treatment of business valuation costs in 2023, which included expensing such costs when incurred as part of business combinations.",
        "Step 2: Identify the treatment of business valuation costs in 2024, which remained consistent in practice but included additional detail regarding contingent consideration liabilities and their fair value changes.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the change in disclosure depth and determine that while the core accounting treatment remained stable, the added transparency around contingent liabilities may reflect a strategic or structural shift in acquisition financing."

          "chunk_text": "product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

By 2023, the company noted that Humira was facing direct biosimilar competition globally, signaling a significant expansion in the geographic scope of biosimilar threats.

          "chunk_text": "and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional (small-molecule) pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie's competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie's products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases.\n\nBiosimilars. Competition for AbbVie's biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as 'biosimilars.' Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products.\n\nHumira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies.\n\nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\n\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie's intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a 'patent term restoration,' for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\n\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity.

      "answer": "In 2021, Humira sales increased by 4% globally, driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, with an 8% increase in the United States offsetting a 13% decline internationally due to biosimilar competition. In contrast, by 2023, Humira sales had decreased by 32% globally, with a 35% drop in the United States following the loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023, and a continued 12% decline internationally due to biosimilar competition. This marks a significant reversal in Humira's sales performance over the two-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2021, Humira experienced a 4% global sales increase, with strong U.S. growth (8%) and international decline (-13%) due to biosimilars.",
        "Step 2: By 2023, the impact of biosimilar competition intensified, leading to a 32% global decline, including a 35% drop in the U.S. after losing exclusivity.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformational decline in Humira's sales trajectory, shifting from modest growth to steep decline due to evolving market exclusivity and competitive pressures."

In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets.\n\nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year.\n\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets.",

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",

In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises, large-scale medical emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities. The future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. We may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. Similarly, state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement (such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing).We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition, our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ, resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities. Our non-clinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some of our customers having to temporarily or permanently close or severely curtail their operations, and unfavorable economic conditions resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact our clients, customers, health care providers, third party vendors and federal and state entities and programs. Among other impacts, we have experienced and may continue to experience loss of commercial and pharmacy care services members due to customer reductions in workforce and an adverse impact on the timing and collectability of premium payments. In addition, governments have modified, and may continue to modify, regulatory standards around various aspects of health care in response to COVID-19, which may adversely affect our ability to ensure timely compliance and meet various contractual obligations.\n\nFurther disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs. Additionally, the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic's disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business negotiates value-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues. Under a typical arrangement, Optum Health receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer's premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement served 7.8 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWe have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting for care. For ex ample, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed 2.9 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2024 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care.\n\nMedicare Part D. Provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people's needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. As of December 31, 2024, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 10.1 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.1 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage.\n\nMedicare Supplement. Provides a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement served 4.3 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products as of December 31, 2024.\n\nPremium revenues from CMS represented 40% of UnitedHealth Group's total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement.",

      "question": "How did UNH's medical costs payable evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's short-term healthcare liability obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNH disclosed that medical costs payable were a key component of its short-term obligations, though the exact dollar amount was not specified in the provided text. However, by 2024, the medical costs payable were explicitly reported as $34,224 million as of December 31, 2024, up from $32,395 million as of December 31, 2023. This indicates a growing short-term liability tied to healthcare costs, suggesting increased claims or medical expenses that UNH is obligated to cover in the near term.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In the 2022 filing, UNH mentions medical costs payable as a significant part of its short-term obligations but does not provide a specific dollar value.",
        "Step 2: In the 2024 filing, UNH provides a concrete figure of $34,224 million for medical costs payable as of December 31, 2024, showing an increase from $32,395 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: The increase in medical costs payable from 2022 to 2024 indicates a rise in the company's short-term healthcare liabilities, suggesting either higher claims volume, increased cost per claim, or a strategic decision to retain more liability."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

      "question": "How has UnitedHealth Group's approach to estimating risk adjustment premium revenues evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of data submission processes and regulatory oversight?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group estimated risk adjustment premium revenues based on submitted diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician treatment settings, with these data being subject to government review and audit by regulators. By 2024, the company maintained a similar estimation methodology but placed increased emphasis on the completeness and accuracy of data submitted to CMS, reflecting a more mature and refined process for capturing risk adjustment data. The 2024 disclosure also specifically highlights the role of both the company and healthcare providers in collecting, capturing, and submitting the necessary data within prescribed deadlines, suggesting a more collaborative and systematic approach to data submission compared to 2022.",

        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a transformation in the company's approach, moving from a general description of data submission in 2022 to a more detailed and collaborative process in 2024, suggesting improved internal controls and regulatory preparedness."

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain valuebased arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for the individuals enrolled. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the role it played in the company's cash requirements and the accounting policies applied?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, 'medical costs payable' was identified as a primary short-term cash requirement, with the company stating it would be met through operational cash flows and existing liquidity resources.",

        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a shift from viewing medical costs payable primarily as a liquidity item in 2022 to a more nuanced and volatile accounting estimate in 2024, with direct impacts on earnings."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

IPR&amp;D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&amp;D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. If the associated R&amp;D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&amp;D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nIPR&amp;D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&amp;D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\n\n## Licensing Agreements\n\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\n\nPfizer Inc.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer forecasted approximately $22 billion in revenues for Paxlovid, based on treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed or committed as of late-January 2022. By 2023, while no explicit revenue figure is provided, the company shifted its language from concrete forecasts to forward-looking guidance, indicating a more uncertain or strategic approach to Paxlovid\u2019s commercial outlook. This evolution suggests a moderation in expectations or a transition from high-demand emergency use to a more measured market presence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Pfizer provided a specific revenue forecast of $22 billion for Paxlovid, tied to treatment courses under signed contracts.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company no longer provided a specific revenue figure for Paxlovid, instead referencing forward-looking statements and broader strategic considerations.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a concrete revenue forecast to generalized guidance indicates a change in the commercial dynamics of Paxlovid, likely due to reduced pandemic urgency or market saturation."

Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results.\n\n## Our Response to COVID-19\n\nPfizer has helped lead the global effort to confront the COVID-19 pandemic by advancing a vision for industry-wide collaboration while making significant investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing.\n\n- Comirnaty/BNT162b2 :\n- We have collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty/BNT162b2, a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19. The FDA has approved Comirnaty in the U.S. to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older as a two-dose primary series (30 \u00b5g per dose). Comirnaty is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be granted approval by the FDA and had previously been available to this patient population in the U.S. under an EUA since December 2020. The vaccine is also available to individuals 5 to 15 years old under an EUA granted by the FDA in 2021 (10 \u00b5g per dose for children 5 through 11 years of age (October 2021) and 30 \u00b5g per dose for individuals 12 years of age and older (May 2021)). The FDA has also authorized for emergency use: (i) a third dose of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 in certain immunocompromised individuals 5 years of age and older and (ii) Comirnaty/BNT162b2 as a booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has also been granted an approval or an authorization in many other countries around the world in populations varying by country. We continue to evaluate our vaccine, including for additional pediatric indications, and the short- and long-term efficacy of Comirnaty. We are also studying vaccine candidates to potentially prevent COVID-19 caused by new and emerging variants, such as the Omicron variant, or an updated vaccine as needed.\n- In 2021, we manufactured more than three billion doses and, in fiscal 2021, delivered 2.2 billion doses around the world. Pfizer and BioNTech expect we can manufacture up to four billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The companies have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty in 2022 with multiple developed and emerging countries around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty to governments under such agreements. We also signed agreements with multiple countries to supply Comirnaty doses in 2023 and are currently negotiating similar potential agreements with multiple other countries. We anticipate delivering at least two billion doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022-one billion that was delivered in 2021 and one billion expected to be delivered in 2022, with the possibility to increase those deliveries if more orders are placed by these countries for 2022. One billion of the aforementioned doses to low- and middle-income countries are being supplied to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price to be donated to the world's poorest nations at no charge to those countries.\n- As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $32 billion in revenues for Comirnaty in 2022, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, which includes doses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed as of late-January 2022.\n- Paxlovid :\n- In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid, a novel oral COVID-19 treatment, which is a SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor and is co-administered with a low dose of ritonavir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The FDA based its decision on clinical data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients), which enrolled non-hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. Paxlovid has been granted an authorization or approval in many other countries.\n- We continue to evaluate Paxlovid in other populations, including in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at standard risk (i.e., low risk of hospitalization or death) (Phase 2/3 EPIC-SR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard Risk Patients)) and in adults living in the same household as someone with a confirmed COVID-19 infection (Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)).\n- We have entered into agreements with multiple countries to supply pre-specified courses of Paxlovid, such as the U.S. and U.K., and have initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 countries around the world. Additionally, we have signed a voluntary non-exclusive license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) for Paxlovid. Under the terms of the agreement, MPP can grant sublicenses to qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide to manufacture and supply Paxlovid to 95 low- and middle-income countries, covering up to approximately 53% of the world's population.\n- Pfizer plans to manufacture up to 120 million treatment courses by the end of 2022, depending on the global need, which will be driven by advance purchase agreements, with 30 million courses expected to be produced in the first half of 2022 and the remaining 90 million courses expected to be produced in the second half of 2022.\n- As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $22 billion of revenues for Paxlovid in 2022, which includes treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022, primarily relating to supply contracts signed or committed as of late-January 2022.\n- IV Protease Inhibitor:\n- In February 2022, we discontinued the global clinical development program for PF-07304814, an intravenously administered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor being evaluated in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19. This decision was made based on a totality of information, including a careful review of early data and a thorough assessment of the candidate's potential to successfully fulfill patient needs. Dosing of PF-07304814 in the National Institutes of Health's ongoing Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-3 study has ceased.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations\n\nAs part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic,\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n29",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to 'more likely than not'; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.\n\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\n\n## R. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRCqualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net .\n\n## S. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\n\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\n\n## T. Share-Based Payments\n\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate.\n\n## Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\n\n## A. Acquisitions\n\n## Trillium\n\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immunooncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium's lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&amp;D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses , of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\n\n## Array\n\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated costs (see Note 3 ). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n64",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer's Upjohn Business was still referenced in the context of historical spin-off activities, with its financial results reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nThe following is a summary of certain financial performance metrics (in billions, except per share data):\n\n## 2021 Total Revenues--$81.3 billion\n\n2021 Net Cash Flow from Operations--$32.6 billion\n\nAn increase of 95% compared to 2020\n\n## 2021 Reported Diluted EPS--$3.85\n\nAn increase of 137% compared to 2020\n\nAn increase of 126% compared to 2020\n\n## 2021 Adjusted Diluted EPS (Non-GAAP)--$4.42*\n\nAn increase of 96% compared to 2020\n\n* For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&amp;A.\n\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\n\n## Our Business and Strategy\n\nMost of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business-Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 75% has been incurred since inception and through December 31, 2021. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\n\nTransforming to a More Focused Company: We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&amp;D and PGS platform functions. In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. See the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&amp;A .\n\nR&amp;D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&amp;D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",

By 2024, the company's approach to Acquired IPRD shifted significantly, with the announcement of a new $100 million upfront payment for a global exclusive license with BioArctic for an Alzheimer's disease antibody program, expensed to Acquired IPRD in early 2025. Additionally, BMS terminated two major licensing agreements with Immatics and Dragonfly, which had previously contributed to Acquired IPRD expenses in earlier years. This indicates a strategic pivot\u2014reducing long-term commitments in certain therapeutic areas while focusing on high-potential areas like neurodegeneration.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Acquired IPRD was quantified at $913 million within the company's operating cash flow adjustments, showing active investment in in-licensed drug development.",
        "In 2024, BMS made a new $100 million upfront payment to BioArctic for an Alzheimer's-related program, which was specifically noted to be expensed under Acquired IPRD in 2025, signaling continued but more targeted investment.",
        "Also in 2024, BMS terminated two prior licensing agreements (Immatics and Dragonfly), which had previously resulted in Acquired IPRD charges in 2022, indicating a strategic retreat from certain programs."

      "question": "How did BMY's investment and strategic focus in Acquired IPRD evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of specific programs and their financial commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BMY reported $913 million in Acquired IPRD expenses, including $445 million for the Mavacamten rights buy-out and $100 million for the Orum upfront payment. By 2024, BMY's focus shifted with a new $100 million upfront payment for BioArctic\u2019s PyroG antibody program targeting Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, while also terminating previously acquired programs such as Immatics\u2019 IMA401 and Dragonfly\u2019s IL-12 program. This reflects a strategic pivot toward new therapeutic areas and away from prior commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, BMY incurred $913 million in Acquired IPRD expenses, including major payments such as $445 million for Mavacamten rights and $100 million for Orum.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, BMY made a new $100 million upfront payment to BioArctic for an Alzheimer\u2019s-related program and terminated prior programs (Immatics and Dragonfly), indicating a shift in strategic focus.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in BMY\u2019s IPRD investment strategy\u2014introducing new programs in neurology while discontinuing prior oncology-focused arrangements."

BMS will be responsible for development and commercialization worldwide, including strategic decisions, regulatory responsibilities, funding and manufacturing. BioArctic has the option to co-commercialize in  Denmark,  Finland,  Iceland,  Norway, and  Sweden.  The transaction includes an upfront payment of $100  million,  which  will  be expensed to Acquired IPRD during the first quarter in 2025. BioArctic is eligible to receive contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones up to $1.3 billion, as well as royalties on global net sales. The transaction is ex pected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.

BMS and Immatics collaborated on  the  development  and  BMS  would  be  responsible  for  the  commercialization  of  IMA401  worldwide,  including  strategic  decisions,  regulatory  responsibilities, funding and manufacturing. The transaction included an upfront payment of $150 million, which was expensed to Acquired IPRD in 2022. In December 2024, the global exclusive license that related to the IMA401 program was terminated and all rights reverted back to Immatics.\n\n## Dragonfly\n\nIn 2020, BMS obtained a global exclusive license to Dragonfly's interleukin-12 (\"IL-12\") investigational immunotherapy program. In 2022, a Phase I development milestone for IL-12 was achieved, resulting in a $175 million payment to Dragonfly, which was expensed to Acquired IPRD. In 2023, the global exclusive license that related to Dragonfly's IL-12 program was terminated and all rights reverted back to Dragonfly.\n\n## Other\n\nIn  2022,  BMS  amended  the  terms  of  a  license  arrangement  and  paid  a  third  party  $295  million  to  ex tinguish  a  future  royalty  obligation  related  to Camzyos (mavacamten), prior to its FDA approval in April 2022, resulting in an Acquired IPRD charge.\n\n## Note 5.

      "answer": "In 2023, BMY reported IPRD-related impairment charges of $136 million, primarily due to discontinuation of development for certain investigational compounds. By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts. The increase from $136 million to $2.9 billion shows a substantial change in how BMY evaluated the recoverability of its IPRD assets within a single year.",

        "Step 3: The change from $136 million to $2.9 billion represents a transformation in the scale and frequency of impairment, signaling a more aggressive or reactive approach to managing IPRD in response to external or internal pressures."

Intangible  assets  are  highly  vulnerable  to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets ex ceeds its fair value, then the asset is writtendown to its fair value. Ex pectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets are subjective and require significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold, Research and development, and Other (income)/expense, net were $2.9 billion in 2024, $136 million in 2023 and $101 million in 2022. Refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nValuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $8.4 billion at December 31, 2024 (net of valuation allowance of $929 million) and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023 (net of valuation allowance of $764 million).\n\nThe U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2024. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).\n\nLiabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain ex penses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for tax es ultimately ex pected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.\n\nFor discussions on income taxes, refer to 'Item 8.

      "answer": "In 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific expanded its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment through the acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC, a provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence solutions aimed at improving drug development efficiency. This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year. This reflects a shift from active expansion through acquisitions in 2023 to a more stable growth phase in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TMO explicitly excluded charges related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition as part of its adjusted results, specifically calling out inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonment of product lines. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose inventory revaluation charges, they were integrated into broader cost of revenues adjustments without specific emphasis on exclusion or large-scale product line abandonment.

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

      "answer": "The Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment maintained a relatively stable asset base while experiencing modest revenue growth. In 2023, the segment reported total assets of $51,091 million, showing a slight decrease from previous years. By 2024, the segment generated revenues of $23,157 million, reflecting a small increase from $23,041 million in 2023. This indicates that despite a reduction in capital expenditures from $1,013 million in 2023 to an unspecified but clearly lower amount implied by the 2024 capital allocation strategy, the segment managed to slightly improve its revenue generation capability.",

Amgen anticipated further pressure from additional biosimilars, including those using on-body injectors that would compete with its Onpro injector. By 2023, the competitive pressure had intensified, with six biosimilar versions of Neulasta approved in the U.S., including an on-body injector approved in December 2023. This escalation in competition led to an accelerated impact on Neulasta sales as more competitors entered the market. Amgen responded by emphasizing patent litigation defense and strategic portfolio management to mitigate further losses.",

        "Step 3: The competitive landscape for Neulasta significantly evolved from 2022 to 2023, with a notable increase in biosimilar competition and a corresponding acceleration in sales erosion, prompting Amgen to focus on legal and strategic defenses."

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen reported developed-product-technology rights with a gross carrying amount of $25,561 million as of December 31, 2021, and $25,591 million as of December 31, 2020, indicating relative stability in the overall valuation of these assets. By 2023, Amgen's disclosures revealed a shift in the composition and sourcing of these rights, noting that developed-product-technology rights now included assets acquired through the Horizon and ChemoCentryx acquisitions. This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights. The inclusion of these new acquisitions in 2023 suggests a strategic expansion in Amgen\u2019s portfolio of developed-product-technology rights, likely influencing the valuation and structure of these assets.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, Amgen disclosed consistent gross carrying amounts for developed-product-technology rights across 2020 and 2021, with no specific acquisitions mentioned in their composition.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Amgen explicitly attributed developed-product-technology rights to specific acquisitions (Horizon and ChemoCentryx), indicating a qualitative and quantitative shift in how these assets were sourced and described.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a strategic change in Amgen's asset acquisition and integration, moving from a general description of developed-product-technology rights in 2022 to a more acquisition-specific characterization in 2023."

By 2023, while hedging was still referenced as part of the company's strategy, the focus shifted toward regulatory and geopolitical risks, particularly in emerging markets like China and under global privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA. These evolving regulatory landscapes, including new laws in states like Virginia and Florida and data transfer restrictions in China, were explicitly described as posing material adverse effects on international product sales, indicating a shift in risk emphasis from financial hedging to complex regulatory compliance.",

          "chunk_text": "## 18. Derivative instruments\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. To reduce our risks  related  to  such  exposures,  we  use  or  have  used  certain  derivative  instruments,  including  foreign  currency  forward,  foreign currency option, cross-currency swap, forward interest rate and interest rate swap contracts. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWe are exposed to possible changes in the values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily associated with our euro-denominated international product sales. Increases and decreases in the cash flows associated with our international product sales due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by  corresponding  increases  and  decreases  in  the  cash  flows  from  our  international  operating  expenses  resulting  from  these  foreign currency exchange rate movements. To further reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to our international product sales, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our projected international product sales  up  to  a  maximum  of  three  years  into  the  future;  and  at  any  given  point  in  time,  a  higher  percentage  of  nearer-term  projected product sales is being hedged than in successive periods.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  had  outstanding  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  with  aggregate  notional amounts of $5.7 billion, $5.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. We have designated these foreign currency forward contracts, which are primarily euro based, as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, we report unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we reclassify them to Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.\n\nTo  hedge  our  exposure  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  risk  associated  with  certain  of  our  long-term  debt  denominated  in foreign currencies, we enter into cross-currency swap contracts. Under the terms of such contracts, we paid euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and received U.S. dollars for the notional amounts at inception of the contracts; and based on these notional amounts, we exchange interest payments at fixed rates over the lives of the contracts by paying U.S. dollars and receiving euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs. In addition, we will pay U.S. dollars to and receive euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs from the counterparties at the maturities of the contracts for these same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged debt, thereby effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on the debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars.

      "question": "How did the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on Amgen's international product sales evolve between 2022 and 2023, based on the changes in the company's cross-currency swap contracts and hypothetical adverse movement scenarios?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen's international product sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as evidenced by the company's $3.4 billion in cross-currency swap contracts and a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in exchange rates that would have reduced income by approximately $640 million in the ensuing year. By 2023, the company's exposure appeared to have decreased, with cross-currency swap contracts totaling $2.7 billion and a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates projected to reduce the fair value of these contracts by only $100 million. This suggests that Amgen's hedging strategy became more effective or was adjusted to better protect international product sales from foreign exchange volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $170 million and $250 million, respectively.\n\n## Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instruments\n\nOur  international  operations  are  affected  by  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  the  U.S.  dollar  compared  with  foreign  currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are  partially  offset  by  corresponding  increases  or  decreases  in  our  international  operating  expenses.  Increases  and  decreases  in  our foreign-currency-denominated  assets  from  movements  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  are  partially  offset  by  corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterlingand  Swiss-franc-denominated  debt  with  a  principal  carrying  value  and  a  fair  value  of  $4.8  billion  and  $5.4  billion,  respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately $710 million on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately $640 million. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.0 billion. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt.\n\nWe have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs, with aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of approximately $700 million and $1.1 billion on these  dates,  respectively.  The  impact  of  this  hypothetical  adverse  movement  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  on  ensuing  years' income from these contracts would be fully offset by corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt.\n\nWe enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  that  are  designated  for  accounting  purposes  as  cash  flow  hedges  of  certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the fair values of these contracts were a $183 million asset and a $39 million liability. As of December 31, 2020, the fair values of these contracts were a $28 million asset and a $237 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.7 billion. As of December 31, 2020, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.1 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $390 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  compared  with  the  U.S.  dollar  relative  to  exchange  rates  as  of  December  31,  2020,  would  have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $420 million.  The  analysis  does  not  consider  the  impact  that  hypothetical  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  would  have  on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had notional amounts of $0.7 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of  December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.",

      "question": "How did the use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals evolve between 2023 and 2024, given the changes in the accrued balance for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D rebates?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",

        "Step 3: The slight decrease in accrued balance, combined with the continued use of prior payment history, indicates a minor evolution in how historical data was applied to estimate rebate accruals, potentially reflecting updated claim trends or improved forecasting."

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nU.S. Rebate Accruals - M edicaid, M anaged Care and M edicare Part D\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method. A mounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Certain of these discounts representing a portion of the accrual take the form of rebates, which are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector (M anaged Care) and public sector (M edicaid and M edicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. M anagement uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. The accrued balance relative to the provision for rebates included in accrued and other current liabilities was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which the majority relates to U.S. rebate accruals - M edicaid, M anaged Care and M edicare Part D.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. rebate accruals - M edicaid, M anaged Care and M edicare Part D is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the rebate accruals, as the accruals are based on assumptions developed using pricing information and historical customer segment utilization mix, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. rebate accruals - M edicaid, M anaged Care and M edicare Part D, including management's controls over the assumptions used to estimate the corresponding rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  rebate  accruals  by  utilizing  third  party  data  on  historical  customer  segment  utilization  mix  in  the  U.S.,  pricing information, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded by management, and (iii) testing rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 25, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company\u2019s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",

        "Step 2: Identify the updated figures and context in 2024 \u2014 The cumulative pretax cost estimate for the program rose to $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs still playing a central role in cash expenditures.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The increase from $190 million to a $4.0 billion cumulative estimate indicates a significant escalation in restructuring activities, particularly facility shut-down costs, reflecting the broader execution of the program in 2024."

By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution had a significant positive impact in 2023, its absence in 2024 contributed to the overall decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, alongside other comprehensive losses during the year.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the Veralto Distribution was explicitly disclosed as contributing $974 million to Accumulated Comprehensive Income, indicating a major positive adjustment.",

        "Step 3: The absence of the Veralto Distribution's positive adjustment in 2024, combined with other comprehensive losses, indicates that the distribution had a stabilizing effect in 2023 and its removal contributed to the decline in 2024."

      "answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment was undergoing a restructuring program that involved exiting certain markets and product lines, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million. This reflected a strategy of streamlining operations and reducing exposure to underperforming areas. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted toward expansion in the MedTech space through acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in intravascular lithotripsy technology, indicating a strategic pivot from cost-cutting to growth through innovation. The shift demonstrates a transformation in the company's approach to the MedTech segment, moving from contraction to investment.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, JNJ initiated a restructuring program in the MedTech segment, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, JNJ completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in IVL technology for cardiovascular disease, signaling a strategic pivot toward growth and innovation in MedTech.",
        "Step 3: The change from restructuring (cost reduction and market exit) in 2023 to acquisition-driven expansion in 2024 represents a transformation in the strategic focus of the MedTech segment."

Acquisitions and divestitures\n\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $132.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $14.6 billion. The Company expects to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject to applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stockholders and other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative M edicine segment beginning on the acquisition date.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nAcquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Company's financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $15.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal year 2024 acquisitions primarily included; A mbrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave M edical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The remaining acquisitions were not material.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $0.8 billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results of operations are included in the Innovative M edicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $1.2 billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&amp;D, for $0.9 billion, goodwill for $0.3 billion, and $0.3 billion of liabilities assumed which included $0.1 billion related to a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

      "answer": "In 2023, the CISO provided at least two updates per year to the RCSC on cybersecurity matters. In 2024, this frequency increased to quarterly updates, indicating a more proactive and frequent communication approach regarding cybersecurity risks. This change reflects an increased emphasis on governance and oversight of cybersecurity threats within the company.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the evidence states that the CISO provides 'at least two updates each year' to the RCSC.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the evidence states that the CISO provides 'quarterly updates each year' to the RCSC.",
        "Step 3: The increase from at least two updates annually to quarterly updates represents a significant enhancement in the frequency and presumably the depth of oversight, signaling a strategic evolution in the governance of cybersecurity risk."

Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk management and strategy\n\nThe Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and monitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company's information systems from cybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent response to actual or attempted cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.\n\nThe Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of third-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a structured third-party risk management program.\n\nThe Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on matters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory training on data privacy.\n\nTo evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to undertake maturity assessments of the Company's information security program.\n\nTo date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Refer to the risk factor captioned A n information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company's business or reputation in Part I, Item 1A . Risk factors for additional description of cybersecurity risks and potential related impacts on the Company.\n\n## Governance - management's responsibility\n\nThe Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity controls designed to address cybersecurity threats and risks. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the Company's Executive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, including security incident detection, response, and recovery.\n\nThe Company's CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company's cybersecurity program and management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information security, and his background includes technical experience, strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and threat experience, and various leadership roles.\n\n## Governance - board oversight\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors oversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity risks, directly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance &amp; Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the board is primarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and oversees compliance with applicable laws, regulations and Company policies related to, among others, privacy and cybersecurity.\n\nRCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others, those relating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides quarterly updates each year to RCSC on cybersecurity matters. These reports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key cybersecurity initiativ es to improv e the Company's risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of certain cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the Company and within the industry.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n17",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ disclosed that profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements were capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product after regulatory approval, indicating a long-term asset treatment. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, JNJ treated profit-share payments made after regulatory approval as capitalized expenses, amortized over the product's useful life, indicating a focus on long-term asset accounting.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, JNJ instead emphasized that profit-share payments were included in current sales to customers, with specific mention of their quantitative impact (less than 2.0% of total revenues), signaling a shift toward short-term revenue recognition and enhanced disclosure.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a more transparent and immediate recognition of profit-share payments in revenue reporting, suggesting a strategic evolution in how JNJ communicates the financial impact of collaborative arrangements."

          "chunk_text": "## Other information\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GA A P). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. A ctual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost patent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GA A P guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales v alue. Sales returns in the Innovativ e M edicine segment are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the M edTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and include volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total rev enues in fiscal y ear 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. A mounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\n\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n37",

By 2024, Yescarta's sales grew further by 5%, reaching $1.57 billion, with a notable shift in regional dynamics: U.S. sales declined from $811 million to $662 million, while international sales\u2014particularly in Europe and the Rest of World\u2014increased from $547 million to $666 million and $140 million to $242 million, respectively. This indicates a geographic expansion beyond the U.S. market.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",

        "Step 2: In 2024, the same risk language about nucleoside-based therapeutics was retained, but the specific sales percentage for HIV products was not disclosed.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GILD recorded a partial impairment charge of $50 million related to certain IPR&D assets, specifically linked to bulevirtide due to a delay in anticipated FDA approval. In contrast, 2024 saw significantly larger impairment activity, with two separate charges totaling $4.2 billion\u2014$2.4 billion in Q1 and $1.8 billion in Q3\u2014related to the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset for Trodelvy following the failure of the EVOKE-01 study and the subsequent discontinuation of the clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC. This marks a dramatic increase in impairment activity, signaling a major shift in the outlook for GILD's R&D initiatives, particularly in oncology.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, GILD recorded a $50 million partial impairment charge related to bulevirtide IPR&D assets due to a delay in FDA approval.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 \u2014 In 2024, GILD recognized two major impairment charges totaling $4.2 billion related to the NSCLC IPR&D asset for Trodelvy, triggered by clinical trial failure and strategic discontinuation.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change represents a transformation from a relatively minor impairment in 2023 to a significant impairment in 2024, indicating a major setback and strategic pivot in GILD's R&D focus."

          "chunk_text": "## 2024 Impairments\n\nIn January 2024, we received data from our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study of Trodelvy evaluating SG  indicating that the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall  survival  in  previously  treated  metastatic  NSCLC,  thus  triggering  a  review  for  potential  impairment  of  the  NSCLC  IPR&amp;D  intangible  asset.  Based  on  our evaluation of the study results and all other data currently available, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.4 billion in In-process research and development impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIn September 2024, based on discussions with regulators and external opinion leaders and the completed evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data, we made a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication. This decision triggered a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&amp;D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $1.8 billion in  In-process research and development impairments on our  Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTo arrive at the revised estimated fair values as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we used a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value, which requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, including critical estimated inputs, such as: revenues and operating profits related to the planned utilization of SG  in NSCLC, which includes inputs such as addressable patient population, projected market share, treatment duration, and the life of the potential commercialized product; the probability of technical and regulatory success; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of SG in NSCLC; an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We used a discount rate of 7.00% which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to ours.\n\n## 2023 Impairments\n\nIn 2023, we wrote off the remaining $51 million balance of a finite-lived intangible asset, charged to Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, due to the termination of a global development cost-sharing arrangement with G alapagos related to filgotinib and their obligation to pay tiered royalties to us on net sales in Europe.\n\nDue to a change in anticipated timing of FDA approval, we also recognized a $50 million partial impairment of our bulevirtide IPR&amp;D intangible asset in Inprocess research and development impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023.\n\n## 2022 Impairment\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Immunomedics in 2020, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired IPR&amp;D intangible assets. Approximately $8.8 billion was assigned to IPR&amp;D intangible assets related to Trodelvy for treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor  2-negative  ('HR+/HER2-')  breast  cancer.  In  March  2022,  we  received  data  from  the  Phase  3  TROPiCS-02  study  evaluating  Trodelvy  in  patients  with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer who have received prior endocrine therapy, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors and two to four lines of chemotherapy ('third-line plus patients'). Based on our evaluation of the study results, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we updated our estimate of the fair value of our HR+/HER2- IPR&amp;D intangible asset to $6.1 billion as of March 31, 2022. Our estimate of fair value used a probabilityweighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to the present value, which requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, including estimated revenues, costs, and probability of technical and regulatory success. The expected cash flows included cash flows from HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer for third-line plus patients and patients in earlier lines of therapy which are the subject of separate clinical studies. Our revised discounted cash flows were lower primarily due to a delay in launch timing for third-line plus patients which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. As of March 2022, there were no changes in our plans or assumptions related to our estimated cash flows for patients in the earlier lines of therapy.  We  used  a  discount  rate  of  6.75%  which  is  based  on  the  estimated  weighted-average  cost  of  capital  for  companies  with  profiles  similar  to  ours  and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We determined the revised estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the  asset  and,  as  a  result,  we  recognized  a  partial  impairment  charge  of  $2.7  billion  in  In-process  research  and  development  impairments  on  our  Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GILD emphasized that inventory write-off charges were primarily linked to products failing specifications and quality standards, as well as changes in manufacturing strategy, with a focus on potential remediation efforts and costly alternatives. By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",

          "chunk_text": "Any adverse developments affecting or resulting from any single entity within our manufacturing operations or the operations of our CMOs and corporate partners can result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the development and commercial supply of our products, which may result in us not being able to generate sufficient quantities of clinical or commercial product to meet market demand and may cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval.  We have incurred, and will continue to incur, inventory write-off charges and other expenses for products that fail to meet specifications and quality standards as well as changes we may adopt in our manufacturing strategy, and we may need to undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenues or market share and damage our reputation. Our business may be adversely affected if approval of any of our product candidates were delayed or if production of our products were interrupted.\n\n## Regulatory and Other Legal Risks\n\nOur operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to maintain compliance, including if significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, could delay or halt commercialization of our products.\n\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, EMA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We have filed, and anticipate that we will continue to file, for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional indications and products. These and any future marketing applications we file may not be approved by the regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all.  For  ex ample,  in  October  2022,  we  announced that  FDA issued a complete response letter for our  Biologics  License Application for bulevirtide for the treatment of adults with hepatitis delta virus infection. Even if marketing approval is granted for our product candidates, there may be significant limitations on their use. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our product candidates under development will be approved or launched; whether we will be able to develop, license or acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nFurther, how we manufacture and sell our products is subject to extensive regulation and review. For example, under FDA rules, we are often required to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. In certain circumstances, we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for our products, which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to healthcare providers, restrictions on distribution or use of a product and other elements FDA deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or product candidates, including serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, or problems with our manufacturing, safety reporting or promotional activities, may result in regulatory approvals being delayed, denied or granted with significant restrictions on our products, including limitations on or the withdrawal of the products from the market.\n\nAs additional studies are conducted after obtaining marketing approval for our products, and as our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients, including patients with underlying health problems or those taking other medicines, we expect to continue finding new issues related to safety, resistance or drug interactions. Any such issues may require changes to our product labels, such as additional warnings, contraindications or even narrowed indications, or the halt of product sales.\n\nRegulatory  authorities  have  been  moving  towards  more  active  and  transparent  pharmacovigilance  and  are  making  greater  amounts  of  stand-alone  safety information  and  clinical  trial  data  directly  available  to  the  public  through  websites  and  other  means,  such  as  periodic  safety  update  report  summaries,  risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  these  or  other  requirements  imposed  by  FDA  could  result  in  significant  civil  monetary  penalties,  fines,  suspensions  of  regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecutions.",

By 2024, BMY not only reiterated the inclusion of sales-based performance milestones in alliance arrangements but also emphasized active execution of these arrangements, as evidenced by ongoing alliance structures and expanded marketing and sales strategies targeting healthcare professionals and managed care entities.

Intangible  assets  are  highly  vulnerable  to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets ex ceeds its fair value, then the asset is writtendown to its fair value. Ex pectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets are subjective and require significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold, Research and development, and Other (income)/expense, net were $2.9 billion in 2024, $136 million in 2023 and $101 million in 2022. Refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets' for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nValuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $8.4 billion at December 31, 2024 (net of valuation allowance of $929 million) and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023 (net of valuation allowance of $764 million).\n\nThe U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2024. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).\n\nLiabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain ex penses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for tax es ultimately ex pected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.\n\nFor discussions on income taxes, refer to 'Item 8.

      "answer": "In 2022, Keytruda royalties were part of the financial impact summarized in 'Other (income)/expense, net,' indicating their materiality as a financial component. By 2024, royalty income specifically from Keytruda decreased due to lower royalty rates starting that year, despite being partially offset by higher royalties from diabetes business divestitures. This reflects a clear decline in the financial contribution from Keytruda royalties, signaling a shift in the royalty structure affecting overall income.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",

          "chunk_text": "## SEC Consent Order\n\nAs  previously  disclosed,  on  August  4,  2004,  we  entered  into  a  final  settlement  with  the  SEC,  concluding  an  investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand  or  on  amounts  that  do  not  exceed  approximately  one  month  of  inventory  on  hand,  without  making  a  timely  public disclosure  of  any  change  in  practice.  We  also  agreed  in  the  Consent  to  certain  measures  that  we  have  implemented  including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business  risk  and  disclosure  group;  (c)  retaining  an  outside  consultant  to  comprehensively  study  and  help  re-engineer  our accounting  and  financial  reporting  processes;  (d)  publicly  disclosing  any  sales  incentives  offered  to  direct  customers  for  the purpose  of  inducing  them  to  purchase  products  in  excess  of  expected  demand;  and  (e)  ensuring  that  our  budget  process  gives appropriate  weight  to  inputs  that  come  from  the  bottom  to  the  top,  and  not  just  from  the  top  to  the  bottom,  and  adequately documenting that process.\n\nWe  have  established  a  company-wide  policy  concerning  our  sales  to  direct  customers  for  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms  of  the  Consent.  These  procedures  include  a  governance  process  to  escalate  to  appropriate  management  levels  potential questions  or  concerns  regarding  compliance  with  the  policy  and  timely  resolution  of  such  questions  or  concerns.  In  addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nWe maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the  current  terms  of  the  DSAs,  our  wholesaler  customers  provide  us  with  weekly  information  with  respect  to  months  on  hand product-level  inventories  and  the  amount  of  out-movement  of  products.  The  three  largest  wholesalers  currently  account  for approximately  76%  of  our  gross  U.S.  revenues.  The  inventory  information  received  from  our  wholesalers,  together  with  our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.\n\nWe believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nFor  recently  issued  accounting  standards,  refer  to  'Item  8.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data-Note  1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.'\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract's performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments\n\nOther GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n\nEstimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.\n\n## Use of information from external sources\n\nInformation from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demandbased sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.\n\nWe have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.\n\n## Acquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations\n\nWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.\n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Ex cess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.\n\nIn transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are ex pensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are ex pensed upon achievement.\n\nWe have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. G enerally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company projected a $89.4 million obligation for retiree health benefit plans for 2022, with projections showing gradual increases through 2031. By 2024, while no updated specific figures for retiree health benefits were disclosed, the company reaffirmed its commitment to funding these plans as part of its capital requirements, even as capital expenditures rose to $5.06 billion (from $3.45 billion in 2023) and total debt increased to $33.64 billion. This indicates that retiree health benefits remain a sustained liability despite shifting financial pressures, suggesting a stable long-term funding approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company disclosed a specific obligation of $89.4 million for retiree health benefit plans with multi-year projections.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, although no updated figures were provided for retiree health benefits, the company continued to list contributions to these plans among its key capital requirements, even as capital expenditures and debt levels increased significantly.",
        "Step 3: The absence of updated figures in 2024, despite increased financial commitments elsewhere, suggests that the company\u2019s funding approach for retiree health benefits has remained stable, indicating a consistent long-term liability."

As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and serv ices to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, div idends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activ ities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and serv ices will be consistent with our past lev els relativ e to rev enues.\n\nCapital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making inv estments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These inv estments, and other capital inv estments that support our operations, hav e increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures ov er the next sev eral years.\n\nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we hav e entered, and expect to continue to enter, into v arious agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or serv ices primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in dev elopment, ov er the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash prov ided by operating activ ities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equiv alents, we held total inv estments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nWe paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&amp;D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. We paid $947.7 million in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of a manufacturing site in Wisconsin. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, total debt was $33.64 billion, an increase of $8.42 billion compared with $25.23 billion at December 31, 2023. In February 2025, we issued $6.5 billion of fixed-rate notes. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the offering to fund potential business dev elopment activ ities, as well as general business purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper.

      "question": "How has the composition of LLY's Retiree Health Benefit Plans' investments in hedge funds and equity-like funds evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LLY reported approximately $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans, with around 38% allocated to alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity-like funds. By 2024, the company's retiree health benefit plans specifically held $281.2 million in hedge funds and $335.1 million in equity-like funds, totaling $616.3 million in alternative investments within that category. This indicates a strategic shift toward more detailed categorization and potentially more targeted investment in specific alternative asset classes, reflecting a more structured and transparent investment approach over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, LLY reported that approximately 38% of the $19,777.4 million in pension and retiree health assets were in hedge funds and private equity-like funds, though not separately disclosed.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - By 2024, LLY specifically disclosed $281.2 million in hedge funds and $335.1 million in equity-like funds under Retiree Health Benefit Plans, indicating a more granular and segmented investment strategy.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The shift from aggregated reporting of alternative investments in 2022 to distinct line items in 2024 suggests a strategic move toward greater transparency and targeted allocation within alternative asset classes for retiree health benefit plans."

At December 31, 2021 the Company had $19,777.4 million in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 38 percent of the total pension and retiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These alternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\n\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain information regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of valuation.\n\nWe tested the Company's controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a comparison of returns to benchmarks and inperson or telephonic meetings with investment firms to discuss valuation policies and procedures, as well as portfolio performance.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and understanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company's estimated fair values and reconciling any differences. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment strategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\n\n/s/    Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1940.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nFebruary 23, 2022",

By 2024, the company reported a total fair value of $2,580.3 million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, with significant allocations across public equity securities, fixed income, and private alternative investments. This represents a notable increase in disclosed financial exposure and detail regarding Retiree Health Benefit Plans compared to 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include:\n\n- working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;\n- capital expenditures;\n- share repurchases and dividends;\n- repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;\n- milestone and royalty payments; and\n- potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.\n\nOur management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the company anticipated that its cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services would be consistent with past levels relative to revenues. By 2024, the company disclosed that it had entered into agreements that could require payments of up to $14 billion if specified amounts of goods or services, primarily related to incretin medicines, are not purchased over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. This indicates a significant shift from a stable outlook to a much larger financial commitment tied to supply agreements, driven by expansion in manufacturing capacity and contract manufacturing arrangements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the company stated that purchases of goods and services would remain consistent with past levels relative to revenues.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company disclosed new agreements that could obligate up to $14 billion in payments if minimum purchase requirements are not met.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the scale and risk of cash requirements for purchases, driven by strategic expansion and new supply chain commitments."

          "chunk_text": "## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nWe believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include:\n\n- working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;\n- capital expenditures;\n- share repurchases and dividends;\n- repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans;\n- milestone and royalty payments; and\n- potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements.\n\nOur management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital equipment expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'Toll Tax') from the 2017 Tax Act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see Notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services and capital equipment expenditures will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act contains a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. While this provision of the 2017 Tax Act is expected to have an immaterial impact on our consolidated results of operations, if it is not deferred or repealed by Congress, we expect that the implementation of this provision will increase our cash payments of income taxes by up to $1.50 billion in 2022 and subsequently decrease our cash payments of income taxes moderately over the five-year amortization period. See \"Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters -Tax Matters\" for additional information.\n\nWe plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices. We plan to invest more than 400 million euros over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.82 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared with $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.26 billion in 2021, compared with $6.50 billion in 2020. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.30 billion and $2.99 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions. This acquisition was funded primarily through cash on hand. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and serv ices will be consistent with our past lev els relativ e to rev enues.\n\nCapital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making inv estments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These inv estments, and other capital inv estments that support our operations, hav e increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures ov er the next sev eral years.\n\nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we hav e entered, and expect to continue to enter, into v arious agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or serv ices primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in dev elopment, ov er the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash prov ided by operating activ ities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to our cash and cash equiv alents, we held total inv estments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nWe paid $3.35 billion in 2024 for acquired IPR&amp;D primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic. We paid $947.7 million in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of a manufacturing site in Wisconsin. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, total debt was $33.64 billion, an increase of $8.42 billion compared with $25.23 billion at December 31, 2023. In February 2025, we issued $6.5 billion of fixed-rate notes. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the offering to fund potential business dev elopment activ ities, as well as general business purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.",

      "question": "How did the role and estimation methodology of patient assistance program costs in revenue recognition evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's financial exposure to these programs?",
      "answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, patient assistance program costs were disclosed as a major component of rebate accruals, with a quantified sensitivity analysis showing a $615 million impact on revenue from a 5% change in liability estimates.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the company explicitly described using an 'expected value approach' to estimate patient assistance program liabilities, indicating a more refined and analytical methodology compared to the prior year's more general description.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects an evolution in how the company models and discloses its exposure to patient assistance programs, shifting toward more sophisticated estimation techniques to better manage financial risk."

          "chunk_text": "## Net Product Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation, which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Rev enue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receiv e payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Prov isions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are receiv ed; therefore, we generally only hav e a few days of orders receiv ed but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activ ities are considered to be fulfillment activ ities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a gov ernmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\n\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serv e pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 24 percent of consolidated rev enue. Further, they each accounted for between 21 percent and 29 percent of accounts receiv able as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\n\n## Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- We initially inv oice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may prov ide for v arious rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\n- The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and v arious other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected v alue approach.\n- The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislativ ely mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, gov ernment rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as gov ernmental authorities rev ise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.",

By 2024, LLY provided more detailed disclosures around the accounting methodology for these revenues, including specific policies on variable consideration, performance obligations, and revenue recognition timing for intellectual property sales. Notably, LLY emphasized that contingent payments related to regulatory approvals are generally not recognized until approval is secured, signaling a more cautious and transparent approach to revenue recognition in collaborative arrangements.",

If a good or serv ice does not qualify as distinct, it is combined with the other non-distinct goods or serv ices within the arrangement and these combined goods or serv ices are treated as a single performance obligation for accounting purposes.

Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our major jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Rev enue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receiv e payment will be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Prov isions for rebates, discounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are receiv ed; therefore, we generally only hav e a few days of orders receiv ed but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling activ ities are considered to be fulfillment activ ities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a gov ernmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\n\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serv e pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 24 percent of consolidated rev enue. Further, they each accounted for between 21 percent and 29 percent of accounts receiv able as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns. The following describe the most significant of these judgments:\n\n## Sales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- We initially inv oice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may prov ide for v arious rebates and discounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\n- The rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and v arious other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected v alue approach.\n- The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n- Most of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislativ ely mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. In some large European countries, gov ernment rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. An estimate of these rebates, updated as gov ernmental authorities rev ise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale.",

The Company believes that it competes principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety, and (iv) price. In the areas it serves, the Company competes with other drugstore chains (e.g., Walgreens and Rite Aid), supermarkets, discount retailers (e.g., Walmart), independent pharmacies, restrictive pharmacy networks, internet companies (e.g., Amazon), membership clubs, retail health clinics, urgent care and primary care offices, as well as mail order dispensing pharmacies.\n\nLTC pharmacy services are highly regional or local in nature, and within a given geographic area of operation, highly competitive. The Company's largest LTC pharmacy competitor nationally is PharMerica. The Company also competes with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacies, pharmacies owned by long-term care facilities and local retail pharmacies. Some states have enacted 'freedom of choice' or 'any willing provider' requirements as part of their state Medicaid programs or in separate legislation, which may increase the competition that the Company faces in providing services to long-term care facility residents in these states.\n\n## Corporate/Other Segment\n\nThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:\n\n- Management and administrative expenses to support the Company's overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources, information technology and finance departments, expenses associated with the Company's investments in its transformation and enterprise modernization programs and acquisition-related integration costs; and\n- Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.",

Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets could, in the future, become impaired.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $108.1 billion and $110.7 billion, respectively, of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser extent the international financial markets; and volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- keeping interest rates low on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities (such as we have experienced during recent years) and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-toperiod volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;",

See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for additional information regarding the valuation of cost method investments.\n\n## Separate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\nSeparate Accounts assets relate to the Company's large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders. Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company's other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity or cash flows.\n\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 4 ''Fair Value.'' Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts' interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value ('NAV') per share/unit on the valuation date.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

However, by 2023, Veklury's sales trajectory became uncertain due to the World Health Organization declaring the end of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 in May 2023. This external factor introduced significant unpredictability into Veklury\u2019s future sales, as its demand is closely tied to the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and the availability of alternative treatments and vaccines.",

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus ('HBV') and HDV products.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Truvada  and  Atripla  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&amp;D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and  other  investments  that  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with  Arcus,  Pionyr  Immunotherapeutics,  Inc.  ('Pionyr'),  Tango Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tango'), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tizona') and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. ('Jounce').\n\n## Strategy and Outlook 2022\n\nOur  purpose  is  to  deliver  life-changing  medications  to  patients  in  need  through  scientific  breakthroughs,  innovation  and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Veklury product sales reached $5.6 billion, up from $2.8 billion in 2020, driven by higher hospital demand globally due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, however, the global context had shifted significantly, as the World Health Organization declared the end of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern in May 2023. This change introduced uncertainty into the future sales outlook for Veklury, as demand became increasingly dependent on sporadic infection rates, vaccination uptake, and the availability of alternative treatments. The earlier growth trajectory was replaced by a more cautious and uncertain commercial outlook.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

          "chunk_text": "We have elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Galapagos whereby the investment is marked to market through earnings each reporting period based on the market price of Galapagos' shares. We believe the fair value option best reflects the underlying economics of the investment. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded pretax  unrealized  losses  of  $717  million  and  $1.8  billion  and  a  pre-tax  unrealized  gain  of  $1.2  billion,  respectively,  related  to  our investment in Galapagos in Other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income due to changes in Galapagos' stock price.\n\nUnder the Galapagos Collaboration Agreement, we had an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of GLPG-1690, a  late-stage  candidate  for  idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis,  in  our  territories  and  had  an  option  to  participate  in  the development  and  commercialization  of  Galapagos'  other  current  and  future  clinical  programs  that  have  entered  clinical development during the first ten years of the collaboration, subject to extension in certain circumstances. Gilead and Galapagos terminated the Phase 3 clinical studies with GLPG-1690 in February 2021.\n\nWith respect to all other programs in Galapagos' current and future pipeline, if we exercise our option to a program, we will pay a $150 million option exercise fee per program. In addition, Galapagos will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% to 24% on net sales in our territories of each Galapagos product optioned by us. If we exercise our option for a program, the parties will share equally in development costs and mutually agreed commercialization costs incurred subsequent to our exercise of the option. We may terminate the collaboration in its entirety or on a program-by-program and country-by-country basis with advance notice as well as following other customary termination events.\n\n## Janssen\n\n## Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey\n\nIn 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Janssen, formerly Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, to develop and  commercialize  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  our  Truvada  and  Janssen's  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor, rilpivirine. This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in 2011 and is sold under the brand name Complera in the U.S. and Eviplera in the EU.\n\nThe agreement was amended in 2014 to expand the collaboration to include another product containing Janssen's rilpivirine and our emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide ('Odefsey').\n\nUnder the amended agreement, Janssen granted us an exclusive license to Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey worldwide, but retained  rights  to  distribute  both  combination  products  in  certain  countries  outside  of  the  U.S.  Neither  party  is  restricted  from combining its drugs with any other drug products except those which are similar to the components of Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey.\n\nWe are responsible for manufacturing Complera/Eviplera and Odefsey and have the lead role in registration, distribution and commercialization of both products except in the countries where Janssen distributes. Janssen has exercised a right to co-detail the combination product in some of the countries where we are the selling party.\n\nUnder the financial  provisions  of  the  2014  amendment,  the  selling  party  sets  the  price  of  the  combined  products  and  the parties share revenues based on the ratio of the net selling prices of the party's component(s), subject to certain restrictions and adjustments. We retain a specified percentage of Janssen's share of revenues, including up to 30% in major markets. Sales of these products  are  included  in  Product  sales  and  Janssen's  share  of  revenues  is  included  in  Cost  of  goods  sold  on  our  Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of goods sold relating to Janssen's share was $530 million, $570 million and $574 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nTermination  of  the  agreement  may  be  on  a  product  or  country  basis  and  will  depend  on  the  circumstances,  including withdrawal of a product from the market, material breach by either party or expiry of the revenue share payment term. We may terminate the agreement without cause with respect to the countries where we sell the products, in which case Janssen has the right to become the selling party for such country if the product has launched but has been on the market for fewer than 10 years.\n\n## Symtuza\n\nIn  2014,  we  amended  a  license  and  collaboration  agreement  with  Janssen  to  develop  and  commercialize  a  fixed-dose combination  of  Janssen's  darunavir  and  our  cobicistat,  emtricitabine  and  tenofovir  alafenamide  ('Gilead  Compounds').  This combination was approved in the U.S. and EU in July 2018 and September 2017, respectively, and is sold under the brand name Symtuza.\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  2014  amendment,  we  granted  Janssen  an  exclusive  license  to  Symtuza  worldwide.  Janssen  is responsible for manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of Symtuza worldwide. We are responsible for the intellectual property related to the Gilead Compounds and are the exclusive supplier of the Gilead Compounds.

      "answer": "In 2021, Vemlidy sales were distributed as $384 million in the U.S., $34 million in Europe, and $396 million in other international regions, totaling $814 million. By 2023, the U.S. sales increased to $410 million, European sales remained relatively stable at $38 million, and other international sales rose to $414 million, bringing the total to $862 million. This represents a moderate increase in both U.S. and other international regions, with a minor increase in Europe.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify the geographic breakdown of Vemlidy sales in 2021 from the earlier evidence, which includes $384 million in the U.S., $34 million in Europe, and $396 million in other international regions.",
        "Step 2: Identify the geographic breakdown of Vemlidy sales in 2023 from the later evidence, which includes $410 million in the U.S., $38 million in Europe, and $414 million in other international regions.",
        "Step 3: Compare the regional sales figures between the two years to determine the change. The U.S. experienced an increase of $26 million (6.7%), Europe saw a minor increase of $4 million (11.8%), and other international regions increased by $18 million (4.5%). The overall change is characterized as moderate."

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

In 2023, the company no longer provided a specific quantitative sensitivity estimate for medical costs payable, instead focusing on the actuarial models and factors used to estimate medical costs payable.

Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2021 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2021 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $184 million.\n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group provided a detailed sensitivity analysis indicating that a hypothetical 1% difference in the estimate of medical costs payable as of December 31, 2021, would have impacted 2021 net earnings by approximately $184 million. This demonstrated a clear quantification of the financial exposure tied to estimation errors. In 2023, however, the company's disclosure shifted; while Medical Costs Payable was listed as a separate note in the financial statements, there was no equivalent sensitivity analysis or quantified earnings impact tied to estimation variability. This indicates a reduction in the level of detailed financial risk disclosure around Medical Costs Payable estimates.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, UNH disclosed a specific sensitivity analysis showing a 1% estimation variance would impact earnings by $184 million.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a shift in disclosure strategy, moving from a quantitatively transparent risk assessment in 2022 to a more general listing without financial sensitivity metrics in 2023."

By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to detail the complexity and judgment involved in estimating medical costs payable, particularly in risk-based arrangements and value-based contracts.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.\n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of 'Double A' as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n\n## Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\n\nCash Requirements. The Company's cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n\n- Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.\n- Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n- Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n- Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.\n- Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.\n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debtplus-shareholders' equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.\n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased from $24,483 million at the end of 2022 to $26,050 million at the end of 2023, reflecting a $1,567 million increase. According to the 2023 filing, this represents the company's 'estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs' as of December 31, 2023. The 2023 report also explains that the company uses an actuarial process to estimate these liabilities, considering factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and healthcare cost trends. This indicates that the company's obligation for unpaid medical costs grew year-over-year, and the estimation methodology remained consistent and centrally controlled.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, medical costs payable at year-end were $24,483 million, as shown in the provided table.",

        "Step 3: The increase of $1,567 million indicates a growing liability, and the 2023 evidence clarifies the actuarial methodology used to estimate this liability, showing both a quantitative increase and qualitative insight into how the liability is assessed."

The impact of changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported sales by 0.5% on a year-ov er-year basis in 2024 primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2024. Price increases contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-ov er-year basis and are reflected as a component of core sales decline above.\n\n## Operating Profit Performance\n\nOperating profit margins decreased 140 basis points from 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024. The following factors impacted year-ov er-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2024 vs. 2023 operating profit margin comparisons were unfav orably impacted by:\n\n- The incremental dilutiv e effect in 2024 of acquired businesses - 85 basis points\n- 2024 impairment charges related to a trade name in each of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments, net of 2023 impairment charges related to technology-based intangible assets in the Diagnostics segment and technology-based intangible assets and other assets in the Biotechnology segment.

The division develops,  manufactures,  and  markets  products  for  the  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  management  of  heart  rhythm  disorders  and  heart  failure.  Our  products  include implantable  devices,  leads  and  delivery  systems,  products  for  the  treatment  of  atrial  fibrillation  (AF),  products  designed  to  reduce  surgical  site  infections,  and information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure devices. Principal products and services offered include:\n\n- Implantable  cardiac  pacemakers  including  the Azure  MRI  SureScan, Adapta, Advisa  MRI  SureScan,  and  the  Micra  transcatheter  pacing  system. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronic-exclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity. The 3830 lead, previously labeled for His-bundle pacing, has now been expanded to include left bundle branch area pacing effectively covering all current forms of conduction system pacing. The Micra transcatheter pacing system, which is leadless and does not have a subcutaneous device pocket like a conventional pacemaker, includes the Micra VR and the Micra AV device families. Both of these pacemakers treat patients with atrioventricular block.\n- Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), including the Aurora Ex travascular-ICD, V isia AF MRI SureScan, Evera MRI SureScan, Primo MRI, and the Cobalt and Crome family of BlueSync-enabled ICDs, as well as defibrillator leads, including the Sprint Quattro Secure lead.\n- Implantable  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  devices  (CRT-Ds  and  CRT-Ps)  including  the  Claria/Amplia/Compia  family  of  MRI  Quad  CRT-D  SureScan systems and the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of BlueSync-enabled CRT-Ds, as well as the Percepta/Serena/Solara family of MRI Quad CRT-P SureScan systems.\n- Cardiac ablation products include a full suite of electrophysiology solutions to treat patients with arrhythmias, including paroxysmal and persistent AF. The portfolio includes the PulseSelect Pulsed Field Ablation System, Arctic Front Advanced Cardiac Cryoablation System, the DiamondTemp Ablation system, Sphere 9 catheter, the first of its kind with high density mapping capabilities combined with radio frequency and pulsed field energies to deliver ablation lesions, and Affera Mapping and Navigation System with Prism-1 software aimed at integrating clinical information to improve patient outcomes.\n- Insertable cardiac monitoring systems, including the Reveal LINQ and LINQ II. These devices are for patients who experience transient symptoms such as dizziness, palpitation, syncope (fainting) and chest pain, as well as Cryptogenic Stroke patients; which may indicate a cardiac arrhythmia that requires long-term monitoring or ongoing management. Both portfolio devices have unmatched accuracy and a streamlined workflow with AccuRhythm AI algorithms to reduce clinic workload and data burden. LINQ II, the premium portfolio device, offers extended device longevity and remote programming capabilities.\n- TYRX products, including the Cardiac and Neuro Absorbable Antibacterial Envelopes, which are designed to stabilize electronic implantable devices and help prevent infection associated with implantable pacemakers and defibrillators.\n- Remote monitoring services and patient-centered software to enable efficient care coordination as well as services related to hospital operational efficiency.\n- Medtronic stopped the distribution and sale of the HV AD System in June 2021. We continue a support program for patients with HV AD devices, and for caregivers and healthcare professionals who participate in their care.\n\n## Structural Heart &amp; Aortic\n\nOur Structural Heart &amp; Aortic division includes the following Operating Units: Structural Heart &amp; Aortic and Cardiac Surgery.

      "question": "How did the financial performance of Paxlovid evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to the non-cash revenue reversal in 2023 and the 57% decline in international revenue in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Paxlovid's financial performance was impacted by a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter, which was partially offset by a $771 million favorable final adjustment in the first quarter of 2024. Despite this adjustment, Paxlovid's international revenue declined by 57% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower global demand, especially in China, following the transition to out-of-pocket market sales and the absence of a prior-year surge in demand. This indicates a significant deterioration in Paxlovid's revenue trajectory year-over-year, despite the accounting adjustments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Pfizer provided a detailed breakdown of Adjusted Research and Development Expenses as part of its broader set of adjusted financial metrics, explicitly linking these expenses to the evaluation of recurring operational activities and future performance modeling. By 2024, while the core definition remained consistent, the formatting and presentation became less structured, with fragmented descriptions and reduced emphasis on the metric's relevance to investor understanding and management compensation. This represents a moderate decline in disclosure clarity despite the continued importance of R&D to Pfizer's strategic direction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the Adjusted Research and Development Expenses were clearly defined and integrated into a comprehensive explanation of adjusted financial metrics, with explicit relevance to investor insight and management incentives.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the definition remained largely unchanged, but the presentation was less coherent, with broken formatting, missing phrases, and reduced emphasis on the metric's role in performance evaluation and forecasting.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a moderate transformation in how Pfizer communicates the importance and structure of its Adjusted R&D Expenses, shifting from a detailed, investor-focused explanation to a more fragmented and less elaborated form."

      "answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue significantly declined from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Paxlovid was part of a broader set of risks related to the company's efforts to develop and commercialize COVID-19 products, including Comirnaty, with specific concerns about reduced demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges transitioning to a commercial market. By 2024, Paxlovid's global revenue dropped by 57% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand globally, especially in China, where there was a non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections in early 2023, and a transition to an out-of-pocket market in the second quarter of that year. Additionally, the global market for COVID-19 treatments had become more endemic and seasonal, leading to reduced demand and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2023, Paxlovid was highlighted as facing risks related to declining demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges in transitioning to a commercial market, indicating early-stage commercialization issues.",
        "In 2024, the revenue table explicitly showed a 57% decline in Paxlovid revenue year-over-year, with specific mention of lower global demand, especially in China, and the impact of market transition.",
        "The change represents a significant decline in revenue performance and market demand for Paxlovid, reflecting a transformation in the product's commercial trajectory and market dynamics."

By 2024, this figure had significantly shifted to just $ (28) million, indicating a substantial reduction in the tax benefit.

      "answer": "In 2021, global Humira sales increased by 4%, driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, although partially offset by biosimilar competition internationally. By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, primarily due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in early 2023. This marks a significant shift from growth to decline, reflecting the impact of market exclusivity expiration and intensified biosimilar pressure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2021) \u2014 Humira sales increased by 4% globally, with U.S. growth at 8% and international decline at 13% due to biosimilar competition.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024) \u2014 Humira sales dropped by 37% globally, with a 41% decline in the U.S. following loss of exclusivity and 13% decline internationally due to ongoing biosimilar pressure.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change \u2014 The change type is 'decreased' with 'significant' magnitude, driven by the expiration of patent protection and biosimilar market entry."

Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie's contributions to its defined benefit plans of $376 million in 2021 and $367 million in 2020.\n\nInvesting cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million. Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million.\n\nFinancing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and \u20ac750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes.

Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of \u20ac700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021.\n\nFinancing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020.\n\nThe company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in openmarket or private transactions at management's discretion.

The company emphasized a unified global operating structure, where commercial efforts were coordinated by geographic region or therapeutic area, and all activities were supported by a centralized global corporate administrative staff. By 2024, AbbVie's approach to aesthetics had evolved, as evidenced by its explicit mention of direct sales of aesthetic products and devices to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers, a nuance not highlighted in 2022. This shift suggests a more targeted commercial strategy in aesthetics, aligning with AbbVie\u2019s broader acquisition-driven growth in other therapeutic areas like oncology and neuroscience, as seen with the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in 2024. This indicates a strategic realignment toward more specialized and direct engagement in key therapeutic segments, including aesthetics.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. (1)\n\nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\n\n## Segments\n\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms \"AbbVie\" or \"the company\" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\n\n## PART I",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" This section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## Company Overview\n\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has l eadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to i nnovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics). The acquisition complements AbbVie's neuroscience portfolio, adding a wide range of potentially best-in-class assets that may transform standards of care across psychiatric and neurological disorders where significant unmet needs remain for patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Cerevel Therapeutics.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Robert A. Michael, AbbVie's then President and Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Richard A. Gonzalez as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Mr. Gonzalez, who has served as CEO since the company's formation in 2013, retired from the role of CEO and became Executive Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2024. Additionally, the board has appointed Mr. Michael as a member of the board of directors effective July 1, 2024. On February 13, 2025, the board of directors of AbbVie unanimously elected Mr. Michael to succeed Mr. Gonzalez as Chairman of the board of directors, effective July 1, 2025, at which time Mr. Gonzalez will retire from the board.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen). The acquisition of ImmunoGen further builds on AbbVie's existing solid tumor pipeline of novel targeted therapies and next-generation immuno-oncology assets, which have the potential to create new treatment possibilities across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AbbVie and ImmunoGen's combined capabilities represent an opportunity to deliver potentially transformative antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies to patients. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of ImmunoGen.\n\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and i ndependent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 55,000 employees.\n\n## 33 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer indemnified GSK for 32% of any amount payable under GSK's guarantee of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by the Consumer Healthcare JV. Simultaneously, Pfizer received a loan of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving \u00a33.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, this indemnification had been terminated in conjunction with the demerger, and there was no indication of ongoing loan obligations or new financing arrangements with the JV.

T he notes were guaranteed by G SK generally up to and excluding the date of the dem erger (the 'G uarantee Assum ption D ate'). W e agreed to indem nify G SK for 32% (representing our pro rata equity interest in the Consum er H ealthcare JV at that tim e) of any am ount payable by G SK pursuant to its guarantee of the notes. O ur indem nity was provided solely for the benefit of G SK. N either we, nor any of our subsidiaries, were an issuer or guarantor of any of the notes.\n\nFollowing its issuance of the notes in M arch 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the C onsum er H ealthcare JV loaned to us and G SK the net proceeds received from  the notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum  payable sem i-annually in arrears. In conjunction with the dem erger, we received \u00a33.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from  the JV in July 2022, of which $4.0 billion related to a one-tim e pre-separation dividend, which decreased the carrying value of our investm ent and are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities . Sim ultaneous with the receipt of the dividends, we repaid the \u00a32.9 billion loan from  the JV. G SK sim ilarly received pro rata dividends and sim ultaneously repaid its pro rata loan from  the JV. In conjunction with these transactions, our indem nification of G SK's guarantee discussed above was term inated.\n\nInvestment in ViiV-I n 2009, we and G SK created ViiV, which is focused on research, developm ent and com m ercialization of hum an im m unodeficiency virus (H IV) m edicines. W e own approxim ately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investm ent under the equity m ethod due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and m inority veto rights. W e suspended application of the equity m ethod to our investm ent in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investm ent was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cum ulative equity-m ethod losses and dividends, and therefore we no longer record our proportionate share of ViiV's net incom e (loss) in our results of operations. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from  ViiV as incom e in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $272 m illion in 2024, $265 m illion in 2023 and $314 m illion in 2022 (see Note 4 ).\n\nSummarized financial inform ation for our equity-m ethod investee, ViiV, as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ending D ecem ber 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n\n",

T he notes were guaranteed by G SK generally up to and excluding the date of the dem erger (the 'G uarantee Assum ption D ate'). W e agreed to indem nify G SK for 32% (representing our pro rata equity interest in the Consum er H ealthcare JV at that tim e) of any am ount payable by G SK pursuant to its guarantee of the notes. O ur indem nity was provided solely for the benefit of G SK. N either we, nor any of our subsidiaries, were an issuer or guarantor of any of the notes.\n\nFollowing its issuance of the notes in M arch 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the C onsum er H ealthcare JV loaned to us and G SK the net proceeds received from  the notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum  payable sem i-annually in arrears. In conjunction with the dem erger, we received \u00a33.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from  the JV in July 2022, of which $4.0 billion related to a one-tim e pre-separation dividend, which decreased the carrying value of our investm ent and are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities . Sim ultaneous with the receipt of the dividends, we repaid the \u00a32.9 billion loan from  the JV. G SK sim ilarly received pro rata dividends and sim ultaneously repaid its pro rata loan from  the JV. In conjunction with these transactions, our indem nification of G SK's guarantee discussed above was term inated.\n\nInvestment in ViiV-I n 2009, we and G SK created ViiV, which is focused on research, developm ent and com m ercialization of hum an im m unodeficiency virus (H IV) m edicines. W e own approxim ately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investm ent under the equity m ethod due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and m inority veto rights. W e suspended application of the equity m ethod to our investm ent in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investm ent was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cum ulative equity-m ethod losses and dividends, and therefore we no longer record our proportionate share of ViiV's net incom e (loss) in our results of operations. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from  ViiV as incom e in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $272 m illion in 2024, $265 m illion in 2023 and $314 m illion in 2022 (see Note 4 ).\n\nSummarized financial inform ation for our equity-m ethod investee, ViiV, as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ending D ecem ber 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n\n",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nThe following is a summary of certain financial performance metrics (in billions, except per share data):\n\n## 2021 Total Revenues--$81.3 billion\n\n2021 Net Cash Flow from Operations--$32.6 billion\n\nAn increase of 95% compared to 2020\n\n## 2021 Reported Diluted EPS--$3.85\n\nAn increase of 137% compared to 2020\n\nAn increase of 126% compared to 2020\n\n## 2021 Adjusted Diluted EPS (Non-GAAP)--$4.42*\n\nAn increase of 96% compared to 2020\n\n* For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&amp;A.\n\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\n\n## Our Business and Strategy\n\nMost of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business-Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 75% has been incurred since inception and through December 31, 2021. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\n\nTransforming to a More Focused Company: We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&amp;D and PGS platform functions. In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. See the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&amp;A .\n\nR&amp;D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&amp;D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new",

T he notes were guaranteed by G SK generally up to and excluding the date of the dem erger (the 'G uarantee Assum ption D ate'). W e agreed to indem nify G SK for 32% (representing our pro rata equity interest in the Consum er H ealthcare JV at that tim e) of any am ount payable by G SK pursuant to its guarantee of the notes. O ur indem nity was provided solely for the benefit of G SK. N either we, nor any of our subsidiaries, were an issuer or guarantor of any of the notes.\n\nFollowing its issuance of the notes in M arch 2022, which fell in our international second quarter of 2022, the C onsum er H ealthcare JV loaned to us and G SK the net proceeds received from  the notes on a pro rata equity ownership basis, for which we received a loan of \u00a32.9 billion ($3.7 billion as of the end of our second quarter of 2022), at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum  payable sem i-annually in arrears. In conjunction with the dem erger, we received \u00a33.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from  the JV in July 2022, of which $4.0 billion related to a one-tim e pre-separation dividend, which decreased the carrying value of our investm ent and are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities . Sim ultaneous with the receipt of the dividends, we repaid the \u00a32.9 billion loan from  the JV. G SK sim ilarly received pro rata dividends and sim ultaneously repaid its pro rata loan from  the JV. In conjunction with these transactions, our indem nification of G SK's guarantee discussed above was term inated.\n\nInvestment in ViiV-I n 2009, we and G SK created ViiV, which is focused on research, developm ent and com m ercialization of hum an im m unodeficiency virus (H IV) m edicines. W e own approxim ately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investm ent under the equity m ethod due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and m inority veto rights. W e suspended application of the equity m ethod to our investm ent in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investm ent was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cum ulative equity-m ethod losses and dividends, and therefore we no longer record our proportionate share of ViiV's net incom e (loss) in our results of operations. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from  ViiV as incom e in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $272 m illion in 2024, $265 m illion in 2023 and $314 m illion in 2022 (see Note 4 ).\n\nSummarized financial inform ation for our equity-m ethod investee, ViiV, as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ending D ecem ber 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, J&J reported a net positive cash flow of $214 million from credit support agreements activity in investing activities and $281 million in financing activities. In contrast, by 2023, the company experienced a net negative cash flow of $3.0 billion in investing activities and a minimal outflow of $0.2 billion in financing activities related to these agreements. This significant shift indicates a reversal in J&J's financial strategy, moving from a net inflow or minimal outflow to a substantial outflow, potentially reflecting a strategic reduction in credit support commitments or a restructuring of financial obligations.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2022, J&J reported a net inflow of $214 million in investing activities and $281 million in financing activities from credit support agreements.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2023, J&J reported a net outflow of $3.0 billion in investing activities and $0.2 billion in financing activities related to credit support agreements.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The change represents a significant shift from net inflows to a large outflow, indicating a strategic change in how J&J is managing its credit support agreements."

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's treatment and accounting for profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements evolve from 2022 to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Johnson & Johnson disclosed that profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements were included in the revenue section, indicating they were part of the company's revenue recognition policy as part of variable consideration. By 2023, the company's treatment evolved, and profit-share payments were referenced in the context of collaborative arrangements that could involve upfront, milestone, and royalty or profit-share payments contingent on future events tied to the success of the asset in development. Additionally, amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities were generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense, signaling a shift in how these payments were accounted for in the income statement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, profit-share payments were included in the revenue recognition section, indicating they were treated as part of the company\u2019s revenue from collaborative arrangements.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, profit-share payments were discussed in the context of collaborative arrangements involving contingent payments and were specifically tied to development activities, with amounts due reflected as a reduction of R&D expenses.",
        "Step 3: The change indicates a shift in accounting treatment and presentation of profit-share payments\u2014from being primarily a revenue item to being more closely associated with cost reduction in R&D, reflecting a more nuanced or strategic approach to collaborative arrangements."

          "chunk_text": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\n\n## Other Information\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company's future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company's consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\n\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\n\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\n\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company's accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company's sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in",

These growth narratives focused on market recovery, new product launches, and competitive resilience. By 2023, the segment's description shifted to a more structured portfolio breakdown, emphasizing strategic subcategories such as Biosense Webster (electrophysiology), Abiomed (heart recovery), Cerenovus (neurovascular care), DePuy Synthes (orthopaedics), Ethicon (surgery), Mentor (breast aesthetics), Acclarent (ENT), and Johnson & Johnson Vision (contact lenses and intraocular lenses).

      "answer": "In 2021, Johnson & Johnson's European sales grew by 24.3%, driven by operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. However, by 2023, European sales had declined by 1.2%, with an operational decline of 2.2% partially offset by a smaller positive currency impact of 1.0%. The decline in 2023 was significantly influenced by the net negative impact of 9.8% from the performance of the Covid-19 Vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. This marks a dramatic shift from the robust growth seen in 2021, indicating both operational challenges and changing market dynamics in Europe over this period.",

This represents increases of 9.3% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.\n\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0% and 2.6%, respectively.\n\nIn 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of 2.7%.\n\nThe Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the 2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\n\nIn 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues.",

During the third quarter of 2021, these businesses, which comprised approximately 5% of consolidated inventories, changed from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. The company believes this change is preferable as it will provide a consistent, uniform costing method for all inventories across the company, better reflect the current value of inventories, and improve comparability with peers. Prior financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted due to immateriality. The cumulative pre-tax effect of this change in accounting principle of $33 million was recorded as an increase to inventories and a decrease to cost of product revenues in the third quarter of 2021. This change was recorded in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services ($20 million) and Specialty Diagnostics ($13 million) segments.\n\nThe value of inventories maintained using the LIFO method was $274 million at December 31, 2020, which was below estimated replacement cost by $49 million. Reductions to cost of revenues as a result of the liquidation of LIFO inventories were nominal during 2019, 2020 and the first half of 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott reported $286 million in goodwill specifically allocated to the Nutritional Products segment, indicating a clear financial stake in this area. By 2024, while specific goodwill figures for the segment are not provided, the company shifted focus in its disclosures to strategic competitive factors such as ingredient innovation, product formulation, and scientific differentiation as part of its broader competitive positioning in the nutritional market. This evolution suggests a transition from emphasizing financial valuation metrics like goodwill to highlighting strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining market relevance and differentiation. The absence of updated goodwill figures in 2024, contrasted with the explicit mention of competitive dynamics, signals a strategic narrative shift rather than a quantitative one.",

Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $532 million in 2021 and increased goodwill by $550 million in 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.7 billion for the  Diagnostic  Products  segment,  and  $16.4  billion  for  the  Medical  Devices  segment.  There  were  no  reductions  of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021 and 2020.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&amp;D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $919  million  and  $1.2  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  decrease  is  due  to  IPR&amp;D  assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2021, partially offset by an increase of approximately $80 million related to a recent acquisition. In 2020, a $55 million impairment of an IPR&amp;D intangible asset  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment  was  recorded  in  the  Research  and  development  line  of  Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $27.7 billion and $27.8 billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  and  accumulated  amortization  was  $15.9  billion  and $14.2 billion as of December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Amortizable intangible assets increased  by approximately $120 million as a result of a recent acquisition and the additional assets are being amortized over 9 years. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $197 million in 2021 and increased intangible assets by $67 million in 2020. In 2021, asset impairments related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased  intangible  assets  by  $14  million.  In  2020,  asset  impairments  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment decreased intangible assets by $148 million. The impairments were recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization  of  intangible  assets  line  of  Abbott's  Consolidated  Statement  of  Earnings.  The  estimated  annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2021 is approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024, $1.7 billion in 2025 and $1.6 billion in 2026.

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and  structural  heart  devices  for  the  treatment  of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care and continuous glucose monitoring products, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders.

Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs.

      "question": "How did Abbott's strategic financial involvement in its Diagnostic Products segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of operational restructuring and segment classification?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott was actively streamlining operations within its Diagnostic Products segment as part of broader cost-reduction initiatives, incurring approximately $16 million in severance charges recorded under 'Cost of products sold' and an additional $4 million under 'Research and development.' This reflects a direct financial commitment to restructuring the segment for improved efficiency. By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally redefined and categorized under four distinct business units\u2014Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics, and Point of Care Diagnostics\u2014indicating a more structured and strategic classification within Abbott\u2019s internal management reporting framework. This evolution from operational restructuring in 2022 to a clearly delineated, standardized segment in 2024 suggests a long-term strategic shift toward formalizing and stabilizing the diagnostic business as a core component of Abbott\u2019s global health care portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, Abbott implemented operational streamlining efforts in diagnostics, including $16 million in severance charges under cost of products sold and $4 million in R&D, indicating active restructuring.",
        "By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally classified into four distinct business units, showing a shift from restructuring to strategic consolidation and standardization.",
        "The change represents a transition from cost-cutting and efficiency measures to a more mature, structured segment with clear internal reporting and strategic positioning."

          "chunk_text": "In  2021,  Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve efficiencies  in  various  Abbott  businesses  including  the  diagnostics,  established  pharmaceuticals  and  nutritional businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million. Approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $61 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\n\n## Interest Expense and Interest (Income)\n\nInterest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. In 2020, interest expense, net decreased $76 million due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020.\n\n## Debt Extinguishment Costs\n\nOn December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\n\n## Other (Income) Expense, net\n\nOther (income) expense, net includes income of approximately $270 million, $205 million and $225 million in 2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  related  to  the  non-service  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes a gain on the sale  of  an  equity  method  investment  in  2021  and  equity  investment  impairments  that  totaled  approximately  $115 million in 2020.\n\n## Taxes on Earnings\n\nThe income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 13.9 percent in 2021, 10.0 percent in 2020, and 9.6 percent in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.\n\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the  resolution  of  various  tax  positions  related  to  prior  years,  and  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019,  taxes  on  earnings  from  continuing  operations  included  approximately  $100  million  in  excess  tax  benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019.\n\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore,  and  Malta. Abbott  benefits  from  a  combination  of  favorable  statutory  tax  rules,  tax  rulings,  grants,  and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.",

The Company purchased $1.3 billion and $4.8 billion of its common stock during 2020 and 2019, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs.\n\n## Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures\n\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\n\nA significant  portion  of  the  Company's  revenues  and  earnings  in  foreign  affiliates  is  exposed  to  changes  in  foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on  assessments  of  cost-benefit  profiles  that  consider  natural  offsetting  exposures,  revenue  and  exchange  rate  volatilities  and correlations,  and  the  cost  of  hedging  instruments.  The  Company  manages  its  anticipated  transaction  exposure  principally  with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.\n\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ( OCI) ,  depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these  contracts  are  recorded  in Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss ( AOCL) and  reclassified  into Sales when  the  hedged anticipated  revenue  is  recognized.  For  those  derivatives  which  are  not  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  but  serve  as  economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in Sales each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nBecause Merck principally  sells  foreign  currency  in  its  revenue  hedging  program,  a  uniform  weakening  of  the  U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $648 million and $593 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe  Company  manages  operating  activities  and  net  asset  positions  at  each  local  subsidiary  in  order  to  mitigate  the effects  of  exchange  on  monetary  assets  and  liabilities.  The  Company  also  uses  a  balance  sheet  risk  management  program  to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. In these instances, Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. For exposures in developing country currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, the Company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the",

The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. A lthough not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in M erck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. M onetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in Other (income) expense, net . The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. M erck principally utiliz es forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the foreign exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument (primarily the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi). The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through Other (income) expense, net . A ccordingly , fair v alue changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than six months. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nA sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly  weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, Income Before T axes would have declined by approximately $239 million and $221 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively . Because the Company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. A lthough not predictiv e in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in M erck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI and remain in AOCL until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary . The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in OCI . The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. Certain of the Company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. A ccordingly , foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within OCI .\n\n## Interest Rate Risk M anagement\n\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal at risk.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was a party to six pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of the fix ed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.",

Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

      "question": "How has the financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting in the Health Care Benefits segment evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in relation to Medicare membership and elevated utilization trends?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted its sensitivity to the accuracy of forecasting health care costs, especially in the Medicare segment where revenue is based on bids submitted in June of the prior year. Premiums were fixed for 12-month periods, making the Health Care Benefits segment vulnerable to unanticipated cost increases, such as those caused by the lingering uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza seasons. In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and lead to premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the company expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility. These developments indicate an increased exposure to forecasting inaccuracies and a continuation of challenges in predicting utilization trends.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, the company emphasized its reliance on forecasting for Medicare premiums, which were set based on bids submitted in June of the prior year, and the risk of unanticipated cost increases due to factors like the ongoing uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment, and expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting increased from 2023 to 2024, with the company facing continued elevated utilization and projected membership declines, which could result in premium deficiency reserves and greater volatility in financial results."

      "answer": "In 2023, the Health Care Benefits segment was grouped with other segments in the disclosure of acquisition-related transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. These costs were reflected in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment. By 2024, the disclosure of acquisition-related integration costs for the same acquisitions was still included under the Corporate/Other segment, but the level of detail increased, with specific mention of the integration nature of the costs without a separate breakout of transaction versus integration expenses.

The 2024 filing also highlights that changes in these estimates are recognized in earnings in the period they are adjusted.

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth's approach to estimating Medical Costs Payable evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's claims management and financial forecasting accuracy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth disclosed that favorable medical cost development related to prior years amounted to $840 million, indicating that the company revised its prior estimates downward, reducing reported medical costs. This suggests that the estimation methods used in previous periods were somewhat conservative or overestimated the actual claim costs. By 2024, the company provided more structured disclosure around Medical Costs Payable by dedicating a full section (Note 7) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which implies a more formalized or transparent treatment of this liability. This evolution indicates that UnitedHealth likely refined its estimation models and reporting practices to improve forecasting accuracy and enhance investor confidence in its financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the company reported a favorable development of $840 million in medical costs payable, showing that prior estimates were higher than actual claims.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Medical Costs Payable was explicitly listed as a separate note (Note 7) in the financial statements, indicating a more structured and detailed reporting approach.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a general disclosure with a quantitative estimate in 2023 to a dedicated note in 2024 suggests improved transparency and possibly enhanced estimation methodologies, reflecting better claims management and forecasting accuracy."

      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth Group provided a detailed quantitative table showing the relationship between completion factors and medical costs payable, with specific dollar amounts in millions tied to each percentage change (e.g., a 0.75% decrease in completion factors corresponded to an $880 million increase in medical costs payable). In contrast, the 2024 filing omitted this specific quantitative table and instead included a more qualitative discussion of medical costs payable within broader accounting policies and revenue disclosures, focusing on estimation methods and regulatory frameworks without referencing completion factors or their financial impact. This represents a shift from a specific, numerical disclosure approach to a more general, narrative-based explanation of medical costs payable.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, UNH disclosed a detailed table showing how changes in completion factors (ranging from -0.75% to +0.75%) impacted medical costs payable in specific dollar amounts (e.g., $880 million increase for a -0.75% change).",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, UNH no longer provided this quantitative table, instead describing medical costs payable in qualitative terms within its accounting policies, focusing on estimation methods and regulatory context without referencing completion factors.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The disclosure approach evolved from a specific, numerical format in 2023 to a more general, narrative-based format in 2024, removing the direct link between completion factors and medical costs payable."

Description of Business\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, 'UnitedHealth Group' and 'the Company') is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company's two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\n\n## 2. Basis of Presentation, Use of E stimates and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company's best estimates and judgments. The Company's most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Premiums\n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers' health care and related administrative costs.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company's customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company's individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans' Star rating. Certain of the Company's Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In ex change, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these valuebased arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\n\nThe Company's Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.",

      "answer": "In the 2023 filing, UnitedHealth Group provided a sensitivity analysis indicating that a 1% difference in medical costs payable estimates would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million, highlighting a detailed quantitative risk disclosure. In contrast, the 2024 filing introduced structural transparency by explicitly listing 'Medical Costs Payable' as a dedicated note (Note 7) in the consolidated financial statements, though it did not include a similar sensitivity analysis. This represents a shift from explicit earnings sensitivity disclosure to enhanced structural categorization within financial reporting.",

This fluctuation indicates a dynamic debt management strategy, where the company significantly reduced its outstanding debt in 2022 through a large-scale debt repurchase program, followed by a moderate repayment in 2023.

In 2022, the company significantly increased its debt repurchase activity, purchasing $6.0 billion of its debt securities for $6.6 billion, resulting in a $266 million loss on redemption. Despite the increase in principal amount purchased, the loss on redemption slightly decreased.

By 2023, the segment faced heightened financial risk due to external economic pressures, including inflation, high interest rates, and supply chain disruptions. These factors were reported to cause unanticipated increases in health care utilization and medical unit costs, as well as volatility in member behavior, particularly among COBRA members whose medical benefit ratio (MBR) was significantly higher than the overall Commercial MBR. This marks a shift from internal operational dependencies to broader external economic and behavioral risk factors affecting the segment\u2019s financial stability.",

The company noted that changes in health care cost trend rates or completion factors could materially affect its estimates. In 2023, the company maintained the same core methodology, but provided more detailed insight into the application of completion factors, particularly for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. It also clarified that it places greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for more recent claim incurred dates due to potential influences from seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix. Despite these refinements, CVS stated there were no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used in 2023, indicating a stable approach with enhanced transparency.",

          "chunk_text": "prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory environment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company's health care cost trend rate.\n\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2021; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company's estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company's health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2021 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\n\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other changes in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company's estimates of health care costs payable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual benefit costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company's estimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company's health care costs payable, see Note 7 ''Health Care Costs Payable.'' The Company's reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for health care costs payable.\n\n## Other Insurance Liabilities\n\n## Unpaid Claims\n\nUnpaid claims consist primarily of reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate for IBNR as of the financial statement date. Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon the Company's estimate of the present value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity and recoveries from the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certain claim liabilities related to group long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company's expected investment returns for the investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated contracts are set at contractually specified levels. The Company's estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changes in investment yields or other factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period they are determined. The Company estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are based on the Company's historical experience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefit payments. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, unpaid claims balances of $324 million and $1.3 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, unpaid claims balances of $532 million and $1.5 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively.\n\nSubstantially all life and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, the Company remains directly obligated to the policyholders.\n\n## Future Policy Benefits\n\nFuture policy benefits consist primarily of reserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts and long-term care insurance contracts. Reserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated mortality, retirement, expense and interest rate experience. Such assumptions generally vary by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Assumed interest rates on such contracts ranged from 3.0% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021 and from 3.3% to 11.3% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company periodically reviews mortality assumptions against both industry standards and its experience. Reserves for long-",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS primarily based its IBNR liability estimates on trend and completion factors, explicitly stating that claim frequency was not used in the calculation and that it was impracticable to disclose claim frequency information due to inconsistencies across claims processing systems. By 2023, the company continued to rely on the same core actuarial principles, including completion factors and health care cost trend rates, but provided a more detailed explanation of how completion factors are applied\u2014specifically that substantially all claims are paid within six months, though full resolution can take up to 48 months or longer. Additionally, in 2023, CVS emphasized the use of a combination of completion factors and trend assumptions for claims incurred within three months of the financial statement date, placing greater emphasis on trend rates for the most recent months. The company also noted that there were no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, CVS disclosed that IBNR liabilities were primarily based on trend and completion factors, with no use of claim frequency due to system limitations.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, CVS reiterated its reliance on the same methodologies but expanded on the application of completion factors, noting the typical payment window (six months) and the extended resolution period (up to 48 months or longer), and introduced a more nuanced approach for recent claims using trend assumptions more heavily.",
        "Step 3: The methodology remained fundamentally unchanged, but the level of detail and explanation around the assumptions and their application evolved, indicating a refinement rather than a transformation."

See Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' for information on how the Company estimates IBNR reserves and health care costs payable as well as changes to those methodologies, if any. The Company's estimate of IBNR liabilities is primarily based on trend and completion factors. Claim frequency is not used in the calculation of the Company's liability. In addition, it is impracticable to disclose claim frequency information for health care claims due to the Company's inability to gather consistent claim frequency information across its multiple claims processing systems. Any claim frequency count disclosure would not be comparable across the Company's different claim processing systems and would not be consistent from period to period based on the volume of claims processed through each system.

      "question": "How has Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment evolved in terms of strategic acquisitions and product focus between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the MedTech segment was newly renamed and included a broad portfolio of products across Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision, with no significant acquisitions reported. By 2024, the segment had strategically acquired Laminar Inc. in 2023 for $0.4 billion to address left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and V-Wave Ltd. in 2024 for $0.6 billion to develop innovative heart failure treatments. These acquisitions indicate a shift toward targeted innovation in cardiovascular care within the MedTech segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, the MedTech segment was rebranded and described as including a broad range of products across multiple medical fields, with no mention of significant acquisitions.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the MedTech segment had absorbed the results of operations from two key acquisitions\u2014Laminar Inc. (2023, $0.4 billion) and V-Wave Ltd. (2024, $0.6 billion)\u2014both focused on cardiovascular innovation.",
        "Step 3: The evolution from a general product portfolio in 2022 to targeted cardiovascular acquisitions in 2024 reflects a strategic shift in the MedTech segment's focus and growth strategy."

Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports &amp; Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment. \u00ae\n\n## Geographic Areas\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.\n\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under '- Segments of Business - Consumer Health,' '- Pharmaceutical' and '- Medical Devices.' However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\n\n## Patents\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company's subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

M ilestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense when the milestone event occurs.\n\nThe fiscal year 2024 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included V-Wave Ltd. and the global rights to the NM 26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition). The remaining activity was not material.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of V-Wave Ltd, a privately-held company focused on developing innovative treatment options for patients with heart failure, for an upfront payment of $0.6 billion, with the potential for additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $0.5 billion, net of a gain recorded on the Company's existing investment in V-Wave and the results of operations are included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Y ellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics A G, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (A D), in an all-cash transaction for approximately $1.25 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $1.25 billion, and the results of operations are included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe fiscal year 2023 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included Laminar Inc. The remaining activity was not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Laminar Inc., a privately-held medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (A Fib), for an upfront payment of $0.4 billion. The Company recorded an IPR&amp;D charge of approximately $0.4 billion and the results of operations are included in the M edTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n\nThere were no significant asset acquisitions in 2022.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of A cclarent resulting in approximately $0.3 billion in proceeds and the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $0.2 billion in proceeds. A ll other divestitures were not material.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $0.2 billion in proceeds resulting in gains or losses that were not material. A t fiscal y ear end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily intangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $0.3 billion, primarily related to A cclarent and Ponvory, that were subsequently divested in fiscal 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\n\n## 19. Legal proceedings\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\n\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A s of December 29, 2024, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of\n\n2024 Annual Report\n\n93",

      "answer": "In 2022, the MedTech segment (formerly Medical Devices) showed strong growth across multiple franchises such as Surgery ($9.8B in sales), Orthopaedics ($8.6B), Vision ($4.7B), and Interventional Solutions ($4.0B), with overall market recovery and new product launches driving performance. By 2024, the MedTech segment's income before tax as a percentage of sales dropped to 11.7% from 15.4% in 2023, reflecting a decline in profitability. This decrease was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs of $1.0 billion (largely from the Shockwave acquisition), $0.5 billion in acquired in-process R&D from V-Wave, and higher amortization expenses. These were partially offset by gains from the Accarent divestiture and lower restructuring charges compared to 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Veklury was a key growth driver for Gilead, contributing significantly to a total revenue of $27.3 billion, with increased sales of the drug noted due to its role as an FDA-approved treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. By 2024, Veklury sales had declined, with total global sales amounting to $1.799 billion, representing an 18% decrease compared to $2.184 billion in 2023. This indicates a substantial reduction in its revenue contribution, reflecting a shift in Gilead's revenue mix away from Veklury over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2021): Veklury was a primary contributor to Gilead's 11% revenue increase, highlighting its importance as a key revenue driver.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 (2024): Veklury sales declined by 18% from 2023 to 2024, with total sales of $1.799 billion, showing a notable decrease in its impact on total revenue.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change: Veklury's role in Gilead's revenue mix has transformed from a high-growth, pivotal product in 2021 to a declining contributor by 2024, indicating a strategic and market-driven shift in the company's portfolio dynamics."

The increase also reflects the continued growth of Biktarvy in all geographies and the continued uptake of Trodelvy, Cell Therapy and chronic hepatitis B virus ('HBV') and HDV products.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  Truvada  and  Atripla  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  expected, primarily due to the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity in the United States.\n\nNet income attributable to Gilead was $6.2 billion or $4.93 diluted earnings per share in 2021, compared to $123 million or $0.10 diluted earnings per share in 2020. The increase was primarily due to lower acquired in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') charges, revenue growth and lower unrealized losses from our equity investments, partially offset by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation, and a charge of $625 million related to the Arcus collaboration opt-in. Our acquired IPR&amp;D expenses in 2020 were $5.9 billion primarily related to our acquisition of Forty Seven as well as collaborations and  other  investments  that  we  entered  into  during  the  year  with  Arcus,  Pionyr  Immunotherapeutics,  Inc.  ('Pionyr'),  Tango Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tango'), Tizona Therapeutics, Inc. ('Tizona') and Jounce Therapeutics, Inc. ('Jounce').\n\n## Strategy and Outlook 2022\n\nOur  purpose  is  to  deliver  life-changing  medications  to  patients  in  need  through  scientific  breakthroughs,  innovation  and strong operational execution. Our strategic ambitions are to (i) bring 10+ transformative therapies to patients by 2030; (ii) be the biotech employer and partner of choice; and (iii) deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. Our strategic priorities reflect how we will deliver those ambitions: (i) expand internal and external innovation; (ii) strengthen portfolio strategy and decision making; (iii) increase patient benefit and access; and (iv) continue to evolve our culture.",

      "answer": "Gilead's gross-to-net deductions decreased as a percentage of gross product sales from 39% in 2020 to 35% in 2021. This reduction was primarily driven by changes in product mix, particularly the higher sales of Veklury in 2021, which had a different rebate and discount structure compared to other products. This shift in product sales composition led to a lower overall deduction rate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Product Sales\n\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, or in certain cases, upon the corresponding sales by our customer to a third party. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates and chargebacks, patient co-pay assistance, prompt pay discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. These deductions to product sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. Our payment terms to customers generally range from 30 to 90 days; however, payment terms differ by jurisdiction, by customer and, in some instances, by type of product. Revenues from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not probable of occurring when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. If we expect, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of control and corresponding payment from the customer will be one year or less,  we  do  not  adjust  the  amount  of  consideration  for  the  effects  of  a  financing  component.  Shipping  and  handling  activities  are  considered  to  be  fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\n## Rebates and Chargebacks\n\nRebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.\n\nRebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, including product mix and pricing, historical and estimated payer mix and discount rates, among other inputs, which require significant estimates and judgment. We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information.\n\nChargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are generally classified as reductions of Accounts receivable on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. Rebates that are payable to third party payers and healthcare providers are recorded in Accrued rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Patient Co-Pay Assistance\n\nCo-pay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Our accrual for co-pay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n\n## Cash Discounts\n\nWe estimate  cash  discounts  based  on  contractual  terms,  historical  customer  payment  patterns  and  our  ex pectations  regarding  future  customer  payment patterns.\n\n## Distributor Fees\n\nUnder  our  inventory  management  agreements  with  our  significant  U.S.  wholesalers,  we  pay  the  wholesalers  a  fee  primarily  for  compliance  with  certain contractually-determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed-upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales.\n\n## Allowance for Sales Returns\n\nAllowances are made for estimated sales returns by our customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. We typically permit returns if the product is damaged, defective, or otherwise cannot be used by the customer. In the U.S., we typically permit returns six months prior to and up to one year after the product expiration date. Outside the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\n\nOur estimates of sales returns are based primarily on analysis of our historical product return patterns, industry information reporting the return rates for similar products and contractual agreement terms. We also take into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\n## Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues\n\nRoyalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the obligation is satisfied and the corresponding sales by our corporate partners occur. Contract and other revenues are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.",

      "question": "How has the financial performance and risk perception of GILD's HIV product portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, based on both sales data and disclosed risk factors?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GILD's HIV product sales totaled $16.3 billion, with Biktarvy showing strong growth (19% increase from 2020 to 2021), while other products like Descovy and Genvoya experienced declines. By 2024, despite Biktarvy remaining a key revenue driver, the company disclosed heightened risks around its HIV portfolio, particularly concerning overreliance on TAF-based therapies and potential shifts in treatment paradigms that could negatively impact future sales. This indicates a shift from a focus on growth to a more defensive posture regarding sustainability of HIV product revenue.",

        "Step 1: In 2022, GILD reported total HIV product sales of $16.3 billion, with specific products like Biktarvy showing significant growth (19%) while others like Descovy and Genvoya declined.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, GILD highlighted new risks in its 10-K, including overreliance on TAF-based HIV therapies and the potential for changes in treatment paradigms to adversely affect product sales.",
        "Step 3: The evolution reflects a transition from a growth-oriented HIV business in 2022 to a more risk-aware position in 2024, signaling increased vulnerability and strategic concern around the sustainability of its HIV product portfolio."

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GILD reported the Liability Related to Future Royalties at an acquisition date fair value of $1.1 billion, based on estimates of future royalty payments to RPI over the life of the agreement through 2036. By 2024, this liability had decreased to $287 million as of December 31, 2024, down from $296 million in 2023. This reduction indicates that GILD's financial obligations tied to Trodelvy sales have decreased over time, likely due to amortization under the effective interest rate method and/or revised estimates of future royalty payments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Deferred Income Taxes\n\nThe net deferred tax liability was based upon the difference between the estimated financial statement basis and tax basis of net assets acquired and an estimate for the final pre-acquisition net operating losses of Immunomedics.\n\n## Liability Related to Future Royalties\n\nWe  assumed  a  liability  related  to  a  funding  arrangement,  which  was  originally  entered  into  by  Immunomedics  and  RPI Finance Trust ('RPI'), prior to our acquisition of Immunomedics. Under the funding agreement, RPI has the right to receive certain royalty amounts, subject to certain reductions, based on the net sales of Trodelvy for each calendar quarter during the term of the agreement through approximately 2036. The acquisition date fair value of the liability was estimated as $1.1 billion, which was primarily determined based on current estimates of future royalty payments to RPI over the life of the arrangement using the real options method and an effective annual interest rate of 2.5%. The liability is amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of interest expense over 16 years. The estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated term will be re-assessed each reporting period. The impact from changes in estimates will be recognized in the liability  and  the  related  interest  expense  prospectively.  The  inputs  used  for  valuation  of  this  liability  are  unobservable  and  are considered Level 3 under the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements for additional information. The liability related to future royalties was categorized as debt and primarily included in Long-term debt, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12. Debt and Credit Facilities for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of $4.0 billion was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually  identified  and  separately  recognized.  Goodwill  recognized  for  Immunomedics  is  not  expected  to  be  deductible  for income tax purposes.\n\n## Forty Seven, Inc. ('Forty Seven')\n\nIn  the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Forty  Seven,  a  clinical-stage  immuno-oncology  company focused  on  developing  therapies  targeting  cancer  immune  evasion  pathways  and  specific  cell  targeting  approaches,  for  total consideration of $4.7 billion, net of acquired cash. Upon closing, Forty Seven became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, magrolimab, represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $4.5 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&amp;D  asset  with  no  alternative  future  use  in  Acquired  in-process  research  and  development  expenses,  and  stock-based compensation  expense  of  $144  million  primarily  in  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.\n\n## 7.

Most of these obligations are expected to be paid within one year, and payment of certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.\n\nIn addition to the purchase obligations noted above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into  with  third  parties,  including  contingent  consideration  incurred  in  the  acquisitions  of  Teneobio  and  K-A.  These  payments  are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring, and any resulting cash requirements are managed through our operational budgeting processes.

We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and seek to choose the optimal modality for a drug target and disease. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases.\n\nOur discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success.\n\nSince  early  2021,  COVID-19  global  vaccination  efforts  have  been  under  way  to  control  the  pandemic.  However,  uncertainty remains  as  to  the  length  of  time  required  for  vaccination  of  a  meaningful  portion  of  the  population  and  as  to  the  efficacy  of  such vaccinations on the trajectory of the pandemic. Challenges to vaccination efforts, new variants and other causes of virus spread may require  governments  to  issue  additional  restrictions  and/or  order  shutdowns  in  various  geographies.  As  a  result,  we  expect  to  see continued volatility for at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. With regard to our drug development activities, we are continuously monitoring COVID-19 infection rates, including changes from new variants; we are working to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials; and we are evaluating the impact in all countries where clinical trials occur. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in their providing care for patients and in our providing investigational drug supply.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  our  R&amp;D  expenses  were  $4.8  billion,  $4.2  billion  and  $4.1  billion, respectively.\n\nWe have major R&amp;D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland;  and  the  United  Kingdom,  as  well  as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties.\n\nOur clinical  trial  activities  are  conducted  by  both  our  internal  staff  and  third-party  contract  clinical  trial  service  providers.  To increase  the  number  and  diversity  of  patients  available  for  enrollment  in  our  clinical  trials,  we  have  opened  clinical  sites  and  will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation-Regulation in the United States-Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also  see  Item  1A.  Risk  FactorsWe must conduct  clinical  trials  in  humans  before  we  commercialize  and  sell  any  of  our  product candidates or existing products for new indications.\n\nSome of our competitors are actively engaged in R&amp;D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit  the  number  of  available  patients  who  meet  the  criteria  for  certain  clinical  trials.  The  competitive  marketplace  for  our  product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance,  thereby  contributing  to  a  product's  eventual  success  and  profitability.  Accordingly,  we  expect  that  in  some  cases,  the relative  speed  with  which  we  can  develop  products,  complete  clinical  testing,  receive  regulatory  approval  and  supply  commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position.\n\nIn addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&amp;D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&amp;D technology rights and establish R&amp;D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&amp;D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing  these  R&amp;D  arrangements  and  licensing  or  acquisition  activities,  we  face  competition  from  other  pharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&amp;D.\n\nThe following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 8, 2022, unless otherwise indicated.

          "chunk_text": "## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Business\n\nAmgen Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate our business in one operating segment: human therapeutics. See Note 2, Segment and other information.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of Amgen  as  well  as  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  In  determining  whether  we  are  the  primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates.\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data with their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\nOur payment terms vary by types and locations of customers and by products or services offered. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.\n\nIndirect tax es collected from customers and remitted to government authorities that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues.\n\nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in SG&amp;A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## AMGEN INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## December 31, 2024",

      "question": "How has Amgen's treatment and valuation of Marketing-Related Rights evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of acquisition cost and classification?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen acquired Marketing-Related Rights as part of a purchase, with a specific valuation of $195 million included in the total consideration of $13,440 million. By 2024, Amgen's 10-K filing indicates that Marketing-Related Rights 'primarily consist of rights related to the sale and distribution of marketed products,' but no new acquisition cost is disclosed for these rights. This suggests a shift from an acquisition-based valuation to a stake-based, ongoing rights model without a quantified dollar amount provided in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2022) - Amgen acquired Marketing-Related Rights valued at $195 million as part of a larger acquisition totaling $13,440 million.",

        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The treatment evolved from a specific acquisition with a quantified value in 2022 to a descriptive stake without a new valuation in 2024, indicating a shift in how Amgen accounts for and reports these rights."

          "chunk_text": "In 2021, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included:\n\n- CE Mark in Europe for Navitor\u2122, Abbott's latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme surgical risk,\n- U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approval  of  the  Amplatzer \u00ae   Amulet \u00ae   Left  Atrial  Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form,\n- FDA approval of the Portico \u00ae  with FlexNav \u00ae  TAVI system to treat people with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open heart surgery, and\n- FDA approval of the Amplatzer Talisman \u2122  PFO Occlusion System to treat people with a patent foramen ovale - a small opening between the upper chambers of the heart - who are at risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.\n\nIn  Abbott's  worldwide  diagnostics  business,  sales  increased  42.7  percent  in  2021  and  40.6  percent  in  2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2021 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of rapid diagnostics tests for COVID-19 and higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business,  partially  offset  by  lower  demand  for  Abbott's  laboratory-based  tests  for  COVID-19  in  the  molecular diagnostics  business.  Growth  in  2020  was  driven  by  demand  for Abbott's  portfolio  of  COVID-19  diagnostics  tests across  its  rapid  and  lab-based  platforms,  partially  offset  by  lower  volumes  of  routine  laboratory  testing  due  to  the pandemic.\n\nAbbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the 'Alinity c' and 'Alinity i' instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained  regulatory  approval  for  the  'Alinity  h'  instrument  for  hematology  in  Europe  and  Japan.  Abbott  has  also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and other markets for the 'Alinity s' (blood screening) and 'Alinity m' (molecular) instruments and several testing assays.\n\nIn  2021,  operating  earnings  for  the  Diagnostics  segment  increased  68.0  percent.  The  operating  margin  profile increased from 24.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 40.0 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales in Rapid Diagnostics in 2020 and 2021 and increased routine diagnostics testing in 2021 in Core Laboratory Diagnostics.\n\nIn Abbott's worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous  new  product  introductions,  including  the  roll-outs  of  human  milk  oligosaccharide,  or  HMO,  in  infant formula,  that  leveraged  Abbott's  strong  brands.  Sales  over  the  last  two  years  were  also  positively  impacted  by consumers' interest in nutrients that help support their immune systems. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 12.8 percent in 2021 and 10.3 percent in 2020, led by the continued growth of Ensure \u00ae , Abbott's  market-leading  complete  and  balanced  nutrition  brand,  and  Glucerna \u00ae ,  Abbott's  market-leading  diabetesspecific  nutrition  brand,  across  several  countries.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange,  total  pediatric  nutrition sales increased 3.3 percent in 2021 and 0.3 percent in 2020 driven by the Pedialyte \u00ae , PediaSure \u00ae  and Similac \u00ae  brands in  the  U.S.  as  well  as  infant  and  toddler  product  growth  across  several  international  markets,  partially  offset  by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. Operating margins for the worldwide nutritional products business decreased from 23.0 percent in 2019 to 21.3 percent in 2021. The decrease was driven by higher manufacturing  and  distribution  costs,  including  commodity  prices,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  gross  margin improvement initiatives.\n\nThe  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment  focuses  on  the  sale  of  its  products  in  emerging  markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 10.4 percent in 2021 and 1.9 percent in 2020. The sales increases in 2021 and 2020 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, China, Brazil and Russia. Operating margins decreased from 20.1 percent of sales in 2019 to 18.8 percent in 2021 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher product costs and product mix, partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives.\n\nWith respect to Abbott's financial position, at December 31, 2021, Abbott's cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments total approximately $10.2 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Abbott's long-term debt and short-term borrowings total $18.1 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAbbott  declared  dividends  of  $1.82  per  share  in  2021  compared  to  $1.53  per  share  in  2020,  an  increase  of approximately 19 percent. Dividends paid totaled $3.202 billion in 2021 compared to $2.560 billion in 2020. The yearover-year  change  in  the  amount  of  dividends  paid  primarily  reflects  the  increase  in  the  dividend  rate.  In  December 2021, Abbott  increased  the  company's  quarterly  dividend  by  4.4  percent  to  $0.47  per  share  from  $0.45  per  share, effective  with  the  dividend  paid  in  February  2022.  In  December  2020,  Abbott  increased  the  company's  quarterly dividend by 25 percent to $0.45 per share from $0.36 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's Nutritional Products segment disclosures did not emphasize the need for clinical studies tied to efficacy claims, focusing instead on general worldwide sales of adult and pediatric nutritional products. By 2023, the filing explicitly stated that if claims regarding a product's efficacy are made, clinical studies typically must be conducted, especially in certain countries or regions. Specifically, for infant formula in the U.S., the FDA requires notification of new formulations or packaging changes, and prior to launch, Abbott must obtain confirmation that the FDA has no objections. This indicates a heightened emphasis on regulatory compliance tied to clinical evidence, particularly for infant formula, increasing regulatory risk exposure and potentially impacting R&D timelines and costs.",

Additionally, in the U.S., the FDA requires notification of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products, with Abbott needing to obtain FDA confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging.

Clinical  trial  costs  incurred  by  third  parties  are  expensed  as  the  contracted  work  is  performed.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&amp;D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&amp;D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research  and  development  collaboration  agreements  that  provide  rights  to  develop,  manufacture,  market  and/or  sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized  and  accounted  for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  until  completed  and  are  then  amortized  over  the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\n\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to  significant  concentration  risks  relating  to  customers,  products  or  geographic  locations.  Product  warranties  are  not significant.\n\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights  in  which Abbott  agrees  to  pay  contingent  consideration  based  on  attaining  certain  thresholds  or  based  on  the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Note 2 - New Accounting Standards\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit Losses ,  which  changes  the  methodology  to  be  used  to  measure  credit  losses  for  certain  financial  instruments  and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  expected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  financial  asset. Abbott  adopted  the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2019-12, Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod  tax  allocations  and  the  methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  clarifies  the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Revenue\n\nAbbott's  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  the  sale  of  a  broad  line  of  health  care  products  under  short-term receivable  arrangements.  Patent  protection  and  licenses,  technological  and  performance  features,  and  inclusion  of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs.

      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's Nutritional Products segment experienced a significant decline in operating margins, dropping to 9.5% from 21.3% in 2021, largely due to the impact of a voluntary infant product recall, manufacturing stoppage, and higher distribution costs. Pediatric nutrition sales decreased by 16.6% in 2022. In contrast, 2023 saw a strong recovery with operating margins rebounding to 16.4%, driven by higher sales and gross margin improvement initiatives, despite ongoing cost pressures. Pediatric nutrition sales increased by 14.8% in 2023, reflecting market share recovery in the U.S. infant formula business, while adult nutrition sales grew by 8.8%, up from 4.8% in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "The  extent  of  the  impact  and  the  timing  of  a  recovery  in  the  number  of  procedures  and  routine  testing  in  a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of COVID-19 cases in that country or region as well as the actions taken by the government in that country related to COVID-19.  In 2020, the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in China began in March 2020.  In other parts of the world, such as the U.S. and Europe, volumes improved across Abbott's hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued  in  the  third  quarter.    However,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  the  improving  trends  in  the  demand  for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries, including the U.S., experienced an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\n\nWhile  routine  diagnostic  testing  and  cardiovascular  and  neuromodulation  procedure  volumes  were  negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates, overall volumes improved over the course of the year until the latter part of 2021 when demand softened in several geographies with the emergence of another variant.\n\nWhile Abbott's branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020, volumes recovered and grew in 2021. Abbott's nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below.\n\nAbbott is continually monitoring the effects of the pandemic on its operations. Throughout the pandemic, Abbott has continued to ensure that its operations throughout the world are aligned with the specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees.\n\nThe demand for COVID-19 tests has been highly volatile. Abbott expects this volatility to continue as the possible emergence and severity of new variants are unpredictable. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  extent  to  which  the  pandemic  will  have  a  material  effect  on Abbott's  business,  financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\n\nWhile Abbott's 2021 and 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 35 percent of total company sales,  increased  19.6  percent  in  2021  and  2.0  percent  in  2020,  excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.)\n\nOver the last three years, Abbott's operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 14.2 percent in 2019 to 15.5 percent in 2020 and 19.6 percent in 2021.  The increase in 2021 from 2020 reflects the impact of sales volume increases for COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth across virtually all of Abbott's businesses due, in part, to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs, an increase in restructuring costs, and the unfavorable effect of foreign  exchange.    The  increase  in  2020  reflects  the  sales  volume  increases  in  the  rapid  and  molecular  diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower Medical Devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of  foreign  exchange.    In  addition,  a  reduction  in  the  costs  associated  with  business  acquisitions  and  restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2019 to 2020.\n\nIn  2021, Abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products.  To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for  services,  raw  materials  and  supplies.  While  Abbott  expects  inflationary  pressures  on  various  raw  materials, packaging materials and transportation costs to continue in 2022, the impact of such cost increases is expected to be at least partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives. To the extent that supply chain challenges in the industries in which Abbott operates normalize over time, this may lessen inflationary pressures.\n\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 19.4 percent in 2021 and decreased 3.8 percent in 2020. The sales increase in 2021 was driven by double-digit growth across all of Abbott's Medical Devices divisions, led by Diabetes  Care,  Structural  Heart  and  Electrophysiology.  The  sales  decrease  in  2020  was  driven  by  Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the COVID19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care.\n\nIn 2021, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 48.6 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 31.4 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes in Diabetes Care and Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. This growth was partially offset by pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Notes Payable and Current Portion of Long-Term Debt was $8 million, as disclosed in the Current Liabilities section. By 2023, this figure increased significantly to $993 million, indicating a substantial rise in the company's short-term debt obligations.

We expect  to  have  access  to  the  majority  of  our  cash  flows  in  the  future.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  evaluate  our  legal  entity  structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.\n\nBeyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above, we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures, research and developments costs, and other operational costs.\n\nWe believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, current investments, Credit Facility and  related  commercial  paper  programs  as  well  as  our  ability  to  generate  operating  cash  flows  will  satisfy  our  current  and  future contractual  obligations  and  cash  requirements.  We  regularly  review  our  capital  needs  and  consider  various  investing  and  financing alternatives to support our requirements.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\n## Affera, Inc. Pending Acquisition\n\nOn January 10, 2022, Medtronic and Affera, Inc. (Affera) entered into a definitive agreement in which Medtronic will acquire Affera for $925  million,  including  up  to  $250  million  of  contingent  consideration  related  to  certain  technical  and  regulatory  milestones.  The acquisition is pending clearance of anti-trust filings and other closing conditions.\n\n## Intersect ENT Acquisition\n\nSubsequent  to  fiscal  year  2022,  on  May  13,  2022,  the  Company  acquired  Intersect  ENT.  Total  consideration  for  the  transaction  was approximately $1.2 billion to acquire all outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for $28.25 per share.\n\nAdditional  information  regarding  acquisitions  is  included  in  Note  3  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  \"Item  8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn May 25, 2022, the Company and DaVita Inc. ('DaVita') entered into a definitive agreement with the intent to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company ('NewCo') with equal equity ownership. The transaction is expected to close in calendar year 2023, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. We are contributing our entire Renal Care Solutions business ('RCS') to NewCo. RCS is part of the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, and Renal division in our Medical Surgical portfolio, and had revenue of $325 million in fiscal year 2022. We expect to record a non-cash pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets of $60 million to $90 million in the quarter ending July 29, 2022 related to goodwill.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nWe have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant  information  available.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\n\n## Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\n\nLitigation Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes,  shareholder  related  matters,  environmental  proceedings,  tax  disputes,  and  governmental  proceedings  and  investigations.  The outcomes of these legal  actions  are  not  completely  within  our  control  and  may  not  be  known  for  prolonged  periods  of  time.  In  some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit  our  ability  to  conduct  business  in  the  applicable  jurisdictions.  Estimating  probable  losses  from  our  litigation  and  governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result  in  a  change  in  business  practice. The  Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or",

      "answer": "Medical Surgical Revenue decreased from $19,957 million in fiscal year 2022 to $19,579 million in fiscal year 2023. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of the RCS business, which reduced the revenue base by $208 million, and negative currency translation effects that further reduced the metric by $458 million. These decreases were partially offset by goodwill from acquisitions and minor purchase accounting adjustments. The evolution reflects a strategic shift involving divestiture and currency impacts rather than organic growth.",

Neuroscience  also  manufactures  products  related  to implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Neuroscience's net sales for fiscal year 2022 were $8.8 billion, an increase of 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2021. Currency had a favorable  impact  on  net  sales  for  fiscal  year  2022  of  $3  million.  The  net  sales  increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  recovery  of  global procedure volumes from the declines experienced in fiscal year 2021, partially offset by global supply chain disruptions and declines in China due to COVID-19 lockdowns and reduced sales in advance of potential national volume-based pricing (VBP) tenders.",

In the U.S., these  include  (i)  practices  of  managed  care  groups  and  institutional  and  governmental  purchasers,  (ii)  U.S.  federal  laws  and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency, including new laws as noted above in Item 1. 'Competition and the Health Care Environment.' Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the U.S.,  as  well  as  increased  purchasing  power  of  entities  that  negotiate  on  behalf  of  Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  private  sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs  in  certain  highly  competitive  categories.  The  Company  must  also  compete  to  be  placed  on  formularies  of  managed  care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.\n\nIn order to provide information about the Company's pricing practices, the Company annually posts on its website its Pricing  Transparency  Report  for  the  U.S.  The  report  provides  the  Company's  average  annual  list  price  and  net  price  increases across the Company's U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010. In 2021, the Company's gross U.S. sales were reduced by 43.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.\n\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In Japan,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  is  subject  to  government-mandated  annual  price  reductions  of  pharmaceutical  products  and certain vaccines. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck's Animal Health segment reported sales of $5.55 billion, and in 2023, this figure increased slightly to $5.625 billion. This indicates a modest growth in the Animal Health business, with a year-over-year increase of $75 million. Despite the relatively small change in sales, the segment's performance remained stable, showing no significant volatility between the two years. This stability suggests that the Animal Health segment continues to be a consistent contributor to Merck's overall revenue, even though it is exposed to risks such as disease outbreaks and global agribusiness economic events as disclosed in the 2022 filing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## The Company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nThe  Company  operates  in  multiple  jurisdictions  and  virtually  all  sales  are  denominated  in  currencies  of  the  local jurisdiction. Additionally,  the  Company  has  entered  and  will  enter  into  business  development  transactions,  borrowings  or  other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.\n\nSince  the  Company  cannot,  with  certainty,  foresee  and  mitigate  against  such  adverse  fluctuations,  fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  inflation  could  negatively  affect  the  Company's  business,  cash  flow,  results  of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nIn order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, the Company will from time to time enter into  hedging  agreements. While hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  interest  rate  derivatives  and  investments  are  based  on  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR), and a portion of Merck's indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which will cause LIBOR to cease to exist entirely in the future. While the Company has begun to implement alternative reference rates as alternatives to LIBOR, the Company cannot  predict  the  consequences  and  timing  of  any  additional  or  unexpected  developments,  which  could  include  an increase in interest expense and will also require the amendment of contracts that reference LIBOR.\n\n## Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.\n\nUnexpected  safety  or  efficacy  concerns  can  arise  with  respect  to  marketed  products,  whether  or  not  scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.\n\n## Reliance  on  third-party  relationships  and  outsourcing  arrangements  could  materially  adversely  affect  the Company's business.\n\nThe  Company  depends  on  third  parties,  including  suppliers,  alliances  with  other  pharmaceutical  and  biotechnology companies,  and  third-party service providers, for key  aspects of its  business  including  development,  manufacture  and commercialization of its products and support for its information technology (IT) systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their  contractual,  regulatory  and  other  obligations  to  the  Company  or  the  development  of  factors  that  materially  disrupt  the relationships between the Company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as African Swine Fever,  could  lead  to  their  widespread  death  and  precautionary  destruction  as  well  as  the  reduced  consumption  and  demand  for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks  specific  to  animal  health  include  epidemics  and  pandemics,  government  procurement  and  pricing  practices,  weather  and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, sales of Bravecto represent a significant portion of the Company's Animal Health segment sales. Any negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's Animal Health sales. As the Animal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations would also become more significant.",

      "question": "How did Merck's expectations for long-term returns on its U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plan assets evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what might this shift indicate about the company's assessment of actual returns?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck projected an expected rate of return of 6.70% for its U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, based on long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on plan assets. By 2023, the company increased this projection to 7.75% for 2024, up from 7.00% in 2023. This upward adjustment indicates that Merck likely observed stronger actual returns on plan assets during the intervening period, leading to a more confident outlook for future asset performance. Both filings emphasize that actual returns are a key input in determining expected return assumptions, directly linking the change in expectations to the company's evaluation of recent investment results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, Merck disclosed an expected rate of return of 6.70% for its U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, citing actual returns as a key factor in this assumption.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, Merck indicated that the expected rate of return for 2024 would be 7.75%, up from 7.00% in 2023, again noting that actual returns on plan assets were a core consideration.",
        "Step 3: The increase from 6.70% in 2022 to 7.75% in 2023 suggests a significant upward revision in Merck\u2019s expectations, likely influenced by improved actual returns on plan assets during that time."

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan's target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among those investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2022, the expected rate of return for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 6.70%, as compared to a range of 6.50% to 6.70% in 2021.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate assumptions for other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n\n",
