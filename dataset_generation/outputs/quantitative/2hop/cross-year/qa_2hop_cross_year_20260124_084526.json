      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset in Canada evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of acquisition cost and contingent payment structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $2.7 billion in cash, with an additional contingent payment arrangement of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion USD) over five years. By 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for the Surmont acquisition was higher, at $3.0 billion USD (CAD $4.1 billion) after adjustments, though the contingent payment structure was not reiterated in the 2024 disclosure. This indicates a slight increase in the total acquisition cost with less clarity on the contingent payment in the following year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, the acquisition cost was reported as $2.7 billion with a contingent payment of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion USD).",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the final acquisition cost was disclosed as $3.0 billion USD (CAD $4.1 billion), but no mention was made of the contingent payment structure.",
        "Step 3: The acquisition cost increased slightly from 2023 to 2024, and the contingent payment arrangement was not explicitly referenced in 2024, suggesting a shift in financial disclosure strategy or resolution of the contingent payment uncertainty."

In contrast, the 2024 filing did not report a similar year-over-year change but instead provided detailed accounting policy disclosures related to production and operating expenses, including how tax-related penalties and guarantee liabilities are accounted for within this line item.

          "chunk_text": "- Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities -Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\n- Guarantees -The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the l i a bi l i ty when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.\n- Share-Based Compensation -We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.\n- Income Taxes -Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.\n- Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities -Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.\n- Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock -Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock (including fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been i s s ued as common stock) and participating securities. ConocoPhillips grants Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under its share-based compensation programs, the majority of which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the company's common stock. See Note 15 . These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not i ncluded as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted net loss per share does not assume conversion or exelrcise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. See Note 22 .",

Off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia near the KBBC, the Ubah Cluster encompasses 11 thousand net acres. We continue to evaluate these blocks and are using information from seismic and prior well results to help optimize future plans.\n\nIn 2021, we were awarded operatorship and an 85 percent working interest in Block SB405 encompassing 1.2 million net acres off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation work was completed in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for SB405 PSC and relinquished the block.\n\n## Other International\n\nThe Other International segment includes interests in Colombia as well as contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries.\n\n## Colombia\n\nWe have an 80 percent working interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3 extending over approximately 67,000 net acres. In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 Block, which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. The contracts for this project are currently in force majeure due to the lack of a defined environmental licensing required for the execution of unconventional exploratory activities. Additionally, the government of Colombia supports a ban on such activities.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nFor discussion of our contingencies in Venezuela, see Note 10 .\n\n## 13 ConocoPhillips   2024 10-K",

      "question": "How did the treatment and compensation expense classification of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about ConocoPhillips' approach to PSU compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company disclosed that for PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to compensation expense, paid at settlement.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the disclosure remained unchanged, stating that the same treatment applied for PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later.",
        "Step 3: The treatment of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents remained stable between 2023 and 2024, indicating no change in the company\u2019s compensation policy for this category of PSUs."

Once granted, these PSUs vest, absent employee election to defer, on the earlier of five years after the grant date of the award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. For employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. These PSUs are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Until settlement occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense.\n\nBeginning in 2013, cash-settled PSUs vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending at the conclusion of the performance period. These PSUs will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. For performance periods beginning before 2018, during the performance period, recipients of the PSUs do not receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent, but after the performance period ends, until settlement in cash occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense. For the performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of the PSUs receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense.

By 2024, the company had fully integrated Surmont into its Canada segment, now owning 100% of the working interest, with the final consideration reported at $3.0 billion CAD $4.1 billion after adjustments. This represents a strategic consolidation of ownership in the Surmont asset.",

      "question": "How has the proportion of liability related to asset retirement obligations changed in terms of recognition and valuation sensitivity between 2023 and 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the company emphasized that the carrying value of asset retirement obligations (AROs) was sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies, regulatory compliance, expenditure timing, and discount and inflation rates. By 2024, while the sensitivity to these inputs remained, the company placed additional emphasis on the liability's recognition process, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and the impact of technology use.

          "chunk_text": "## Impairments\n\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before incometaxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods i n which the determination is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for E&amp;P assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.\n\nThe expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period.\n\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances i ndicate a loss in value has occurred. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. When such a condition is j udgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs\n\nUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, i ncorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. Estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. The carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other i nputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the l i a bi l i ty a nd future settlement of our obligation.\n\nNormally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&amp;A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase i n the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&amp;E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.\n\nIn addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown ti me and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.

      "answer": "In 2023, COP accounted for dry hole expenses under the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending evaluation and expensed as dry holes if economically recoverable reserves are not found. This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, COP disclosed that dry hole costs were a result of exploratory well evaluations under the successful efforts method, with costs either capitalized or expensed depending on reserve discovery.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, COP explicitly disclosed dry hole expenses as a distinct line item, showing a significant increase from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024.",
        "Step 3: The change represents a transformation in the magnitude of dry hole expenses and a shift in disclosure approach, moving from a qualitative explanation to a quantitative breakdown within exploration expenses."

Other new technologies or businesses and LNG licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG.

Earnings in 'Other' increased by $422 million in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily due to a tax benefit of $455 million as a result of the acquisition of Marathon Oil and the subsequent utilization of foreign tax credits, and the absence of $89 million loss associated with forward foreign exchange contracts to buy CAD, in support of our acquisition of additional working interest in Surmont in 2023. Decreases to earnings in \"Other\" were driven by a loss of $147 million associated with the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 16 .",

There was no change to working interest as part of ConocoPhillips becoming sole operator.\n\n## KBB\n\nGas is transported from the KBB platform via pipeline for sale to the domestic gas market. Since 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating LNG vessel, which provided additional gas offtake capacity.\n\n## Block G\n\n## Malikai\n\nWe own a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. Malikai Phase 2 development first oil was achieved in February 2021. Malikai operates on a tension leg platform and pipes oil to the KBB platform for processing. Oil evacuation is via pipeline to SOGT for tanker liftings.\n\n## Siakap North-Petai\n\nWe own a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil field. First oil from SNP Phase 2 was achieved in November 2021. The subsea system in the SNP oil field is tied back to a FPSO operated by PTTEP.\n\n## Exploration\n\nWe operate three exploration PSCs with 85 percent working interest in Block SK304, 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00 and 35 percent working interest i n the Ubah Cluster. Off the coast of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia, Block SK304 encompasses 1.8 million net acres and Block WL4-00 encompasses 0.3 million net acres. Off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia near the KBBC, the Ubah Cluster encompasses 11 thousand net acres. We continue to evaluate these blocks and are using information from seismic and prior well results to help optimize future plans.\n\nIn 2021, we were awarded operatorship and an 85 percent working interest in Block SB405 encompassing 1.2 million net acres off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation work was completed in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for SB405 PSC and relinquished the block.\n\n## Other International\n\nThe Other International segment includes interests in Colombia as well as contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries.\n\n## Colombia\n\nWe have an 80 percent working interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3 extending over approximately 67,000 net acres. In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 Block, which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. The contracts for this project are currently in force majeure due to the lack of a defined environmental licensing required for the execution of unconventional exploratory activities. Additionally, the government of Colombia supports a ban on such activities.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nFor discussion of our contingencies in Venezuela, see Note 10 .\n\n## 13 ConocoPhillips   2024 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:\n\n- Revisions : In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 298 million barrels and technical revisions of 28 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 114 million barrels for changes in development plans, 23 million barrels due to lower prices and increasing operating costs of 4 million barrels. An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects. Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in Canada and Asia Pacific/Middle East were driven primarily by Montney and Bohai Phase 4B in China, respectively.\n\nIn 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n140",

      "answer": "In 2023, Sales and Other Operating Revenues decreased by $22,353 million, primarily due to lower realized commodity prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. In contrast, 2024 saw a more granular disclosure indicating disaggregation of consolidated sales and other operating revenues, suggesting a shift in how the company reports and manages its revenue streams. This indicates a transformation in the presentation and possibly the underlying structure of revenue generation, moving from a decline influenced by commodity pricing to a more segmented and transparent reporting approach.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, the company reported a significant decrease in Sales and Other Operating Revenues by $22,353 million, driven by lower commodity prices.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how revenue is reported and potentially managed, shifting from a year of decline due to external pricing pressures to a year of internal structural reporting improvements."

      "answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, DD&A expenses are explicitly stated to have negatively impacted earnings, driven by higher rates from reserve revisions and increased production volumes.",

        "Step 3: The continued rise in DD&A expenses indicates that the cost pressures identified in 2023 persisted into 2024, suggesting ongoing challenges in managing depletion and depreciation costs despite production efficiency efforts."

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for descriptions of our significant accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\n\n## Oil and Gas Accounting\n\nAccounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&amp;G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.\n\n## Property Acquisition Costs\n\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For insignificant i ndividual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This j udgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold i mpairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.\n\nAt year-end 2024, we held $14.7 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs, $10.8 billion of which was added this year through our acquisition of Marathon Oil. These capitalized costs consist primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $13.4 billion is concentrated in the Lower 48 Basins, primarily the Delaware, Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins, where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. Outside of the Lower 48 Basins, the remaining $1.3 billion is primarily concentrated in Canada. Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\n\n## Exploratory Costs\n\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.\n\nIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of 'sufficient progress' is a j udgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will i mprove or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or coventurer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.\n\nAt year-end 2024, total suspended well costs were $196 million, compared with $184 million at year-end 2023. For additional information on suspended wells, i ncluding an aging analysis, see Note 6 .",

      "answer": "In 2023, Bohai Phase 4B in China was explicitly cited as a key driver of extensions and discoveries within the Asia Pacific/Middle East region. However, by 2024, the focus in that region shifted to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5, indicating a progression in development from Phase 4B to Phase 5. This evolution reflects a strategic continuation and expansion of operations in China.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Bohai Phase 4B is specifically mentioned as a primary contributor to extensions and discoveries in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the mention of Bohai Phase 4B disappears, and instead, the sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 is noted as the key technical development in the same region.",
        "Step 3: The shift from Bohai Phase 4B to Bohai Bay Phase 5 in the disclosures indicates a natural progression and evolution in the company's development activities in China."

          "chunk_text": "Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:\n\n- Revisions : In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 298 million barrels and technical revisions of 28 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 114 million barrels for changes in development plans, 23 million barrels due to lower prices and increasing operating costs of 4 million barrels. An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects.

An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects. Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin.

          "chunk_text": "Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:\n\n- Revisions : In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 298 million barrels and technical revisions of 28 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 114 million barrels for changes in development plans, 23 million barrels due to lower prices and increasing operating costs of 4 million barrels. An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects. Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in Canada and Asia Pacific/Middle East were driven primarily by Montney and Bohai Phase 4B in China, respectively.\n\nIn 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin.

For performance periods beginning before 2009, PSUs do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company. With respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, PSUs do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employee's separation from the company or five years after the grant date (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation). We recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Because these awards are authorized three years prior to the effective grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Until issued as stock, recipients of the stock-settled PSUs issued prior to 2013 receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. Beginning in 2013, stock-settled PSUs authorized for future grants will vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period.

The remaining extensions and discoveries were driven by the continued development planned in the other geographic regions, including Canada, Lower 48 unconventional plays, and Alaska.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. Approximately 75 percent of the transfers were from the development of our Lower 48 unconventional plays. The remainder of transfers were from development across the other geographic regions.\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, our PUDs represented 35 percent of total proved reserves. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2024, relating to the development of PUDs were $9.4 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the PUDs will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.\n\nAt the end of 2024, approximately 88 percent of total PUDs were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure, i ncluding all of our Lower 48 PUDs. The PUDs to be developed beyond five years are in the Willow project in Alaska, a development that is currently underway with production anticipated in 2029 due to its large scale and remote location, as well as in major development areas which are currently producing and l ocated in Canada and in our equity affiliate in Australia.",

By 2024, while the Accrued Reinvested Dividend Equivalent was still referenced in the context of cash-settled RSUs awarded in 2018 and 2019, there was no new cash-settled stock unit activity and no remaining unrecognized compensation cost for unvested cash-settled units.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-settled RSUs granted during 2023 and 2022 was $110.91 and 90.57, respectively. The total fair value of stock-settled RSUs issued during 2023 and 2022 was $284 million and $193 million, respectively.\n\n## Cash-Settled\n\nCash-settled executive RSUs granted in 2018 and 2019 replaced the stock option program. These RSUs, subject to elections to defer, were settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Executive RSUs awarded to retirement eligible employees may vest earlier; however, those units were not settled until after the earlier of separation from the company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Compensation expense was initially measured using the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock and was subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the settlement date. Recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. The accrued reinvested dividend was paid at the time of settlement, subject to the terms and conditions of the award.\n\nThere was no cash-settled stock unit activity and no remaining unrecognized compensation cost to be recorded for the unvested cash-settled units for the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The total fair value of cash-settled executive RSUs issued during 2022 was $21 million.\n\nPerformance Share Program -Under the Omnibus Plan, we also annually grant restricted PSUs to senior management.

      "answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, cash-settled PSUs included specific provisions for dividend equivalents, with differences based on performance periods starting before or in/after 2018. These were charged to compensation expense.",

        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in the structure of equity-based compensation, shifting from cash-settled PSUs to stock-settled RSUs, with corresponding differences in how dividend equivalents are handled and accounted for."

Units awarded to retirement eligible employees under the general and executive RSU programs may vest earlier; however, those units are not settled through the issuance of common stock until after the earlier of separation from the company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the RSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. The grant date fair market value of these RSUs is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date. The grant date fair market value of RSUs that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the estimated dividends that will not be received.\n\nThe following summarizes our stock-settled stock RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n\n",

By 2024, these figures increased to $88,461 million for the Lower 48 and $11,274 million for the Asia Pacific/Middle East, indicating a significant increase in investment concentration in the Lower 48 and a modest increase in the Asia Pacific/Middle East. This reflects a strategic shift towards expanding domestic operations while maintaining a steady presence internationally.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP incurred $162 million in dry hole costs and leasehold impairments, while in 2024, this figure decreased to $46 million. This significant reduction indicates a shift in COP's exploration strategy, with fewer dry hole costs recorded in 2024 compared to the prior year, potentially reflecting more targeted or successful exploration efforts.",

        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 (2023) - COP incurred $162 million in dry hole costs and leasehold impairments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company\u2019s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, COP acquired the remaining 50% stake in Surmont for $3.0 billion, becoming the sole owner.",
        "Step 2: By 2024, the Surmont acquisition was disclosed as completed, indicating a full strategic integration into COP's Canada segment.",
        "Step 3: The acquisition led to increased debt and influenced capital return plans, showing a transformation in both asset ownership and capital structure."

      "answer": "In 2023, the Montney unconventional play in Canada was a key contributor to ConocoPhillips' extensions and discoveries, alongside Bohai Phase 4B in China. By 2024, Montney remained a focal point for extensions and discoveries in Canada, indicating continued strategic emphasis on the play. This shows that Montney maintained its importance in the company's portfolio, with no indication of reduced activity or strategic shift away from the play between the two years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Montney was explicitly cited as a primary driver of extensions and discoveries in Canada, alongside Bohai Phase 4B in China.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Montney was again highlighted as a key area for extensions and discoveries in Canada, showing continuity in its role.",
        "Step 3: The consistent mention of Montney in both years indicates that it remained a strategic asset without any reduction or increase in activity, suggesting a stable and sustained focus."

          "chunk_text": "Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:\n\n- Revisions : In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 298 million barrels and technical revisions of 28 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 114 million barrels for changes in development plans, 23 million barrels due to lower prices and increasing operating costs of 4 million barrels. An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects. Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in Canada and Asia Pacific/Middle East were driven primarily by Montney and Bohai Phase 4B in China, respectively.\n\nIn 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n140",

In 2024, while there is no explicit mention of a negative impact from production and operating expenses, the company disclosed that penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are now reflected in production and operating expenses, indicating a shift in how certain financial liabilities are accounted for within this line item. This represents a change in the composition and disclosure of the expense category rather than a direct quantitative increase or decrease.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 - In 2023, production and operating expenses were explicitly stated to have increased due to operational factors such as well work activities and higher production volumes, negatively impacting earnings.",
        "Step 2: Identify state/situation in Year 2 - In 2024, production and operating expenses were not described in terms of operational volume or activity changes, but instead, the company disclosed that penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are now included in this expense category.",
        "Step 3: Analyze and characterize the change - The nature of the disclosure around production and operating expenses shifted from operational drivers in 2023 to accounting policy clarification in 2024, indicating a transformation in how the expense category is reported rather than a direct change in its magnitude."

          "chunk_text": "- Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities -Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\n- Guarantees -The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the l i a bi l i ty when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.\n- Share-Based Compensation -We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.\n- Income Taxes -Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.\n- Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities -Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.\n- Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock -Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock (including fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been i s s ued as common stock) and participating securities. ConocoPhillips grants Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under its share-based compensation programs, the majority of which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the company's common stock. See Note 15 . These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not i ncluded as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted net loss per share does not assume conversion or exelrcise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. See Note 22 .",

By 2024, the company expanded its emission-reduction commitments to include Pioneer assets by 2035, and these additional costs were also factored into its impairment testing process. This indicates a broader integration of emission-related costs into its long-term planning and asset valuation methodology.",

Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

      "answer": "In 2023, XOM reported capturing $9.7 billion of structural cost savings compared to 2019, including $2.3 billion of savings realized specifically during that year. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance. This evolution shows that XOM transitioned from achieving cost savings as a\u9636\u6bb5\u6027 initiative to embedding it as a core financial metric in its reporting and operational strategy.",

The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\n\nAdvantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\n\n- Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects) . Includes Permian (heritage Permian and Pioneer), Guyana and LNG. (1)\n- Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\n- High-Value Products. Includes  performance  products  and  lower-emission  fuels.  Performance  products  (performance  chemicals,  performance  lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant  additional  value  to  customers  and  end-users. Lower-emission  fuels  refers  to  fuels  with  lower  life  cycle  emissions  than  conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\n\nBase Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\n\nStructural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on the next page, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the volume/mix driver.\n\nExpenses. Represents all ex penses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\n\nTiming Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\n\nAdvantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\n\n- Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects) . Includes Permian (heritage Permian and Pioneer), Guyana and LNG. (1)\n- Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\n- High-Value Products. Includes  performance  products  and  lower-emission  fuels.  Performance  products  (performance  chemicals,  performance  lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant  additional  value  to  customers  and  end-users. Lower-emission  fuels  refers  to  fuels  with  lower  life  cycle  emissions  than  conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\n\nBase Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\n\nStructural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on the next page, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the volume/mix driver.\n\nExpenses. Represents all ex penses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\n\nTiming Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil defined Structural Cost Savings as sustainable decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) compared to 2019 levels, with cumulative savings totaling $9.7 billion. The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",

        "Step 2: In 2024, the definition evolved to include after-tax earnings effects and expenses from divestments, positioning Structural Cost Savings as a formal earnings driver tied to financial performance visibility.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a transformation in how ExxonMobil communicates cost savings \u2014 from an internally managed efficiency metric to a transparent earnings component, indicating a more strategic and externally communicated financial lever."

The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\n\nAdvantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\n\n- Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects) . Includes Permian (heritage Permian and Pioneer), Guyana and LNG. (1)\n- Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\n- High-Value Products. Includes  performance  products  and  lower-emission  fuels.  Performance  products  (performance  chemicals,  performance  lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant  additional  value  to  customers  and  end-users. Lower-emission  fuels  refers  to  fuels  with  lower  life  cycle  emissions  than  conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\n\nBase Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\n\nStructural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on the next page, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the volume/mix driver.\n\nExpenses. Represents all ex penses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\n\nTiming Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

      "answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil acquired Denbury Inc. by issuing 46 million shares with a fair value of $4.8 billion. The year also saw the sale of Esso Thailand and upstream asset divestitures in the U.S. In 2024, the company significantly scaled up its acquisition activity by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources through the issuance of 545 million shares valued at $63 billion, along with $5 billion in assumed debt. Additionally, the scope of asset sales expanded geographically in 2024 to include upstream assets in Argentina and Nigeria, compared to only the U.S. in 2023. This reflects a major increase in both the size and geographic diversity of ExxonMobil's transactional activity.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations incurred in the current period were level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.\n\nAsset retirement obligations for facilities in the Product Solutions business generally become firm at the time a decision is made to permanently shut down and dismantle the facilities. These obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. However, these sites generally have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:\n\n",

By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction.

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

By 2024, the company began disclosing $1 in Medicare subsidy receipts starting in 2025 and continuing through 2029 and beyond.

Dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.68 per share from $3.55 per share and totaled $14.9 billion.\n\nDuring 2023, the Corporation continued its share repurchase program for up to $50 billion in shares through 2024, including the purchase of 162 million shares at a book value of $17.5 billion in 2023.\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe Corporation has contractual obligations involving commitments to third parties that impact its liquidity and capital resource needs. These contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations, and firm capital commitments. See Notes 9, 11, 14 and 17 for information related to asset retirement obligations, leases, long-term debt and pensions, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Corporation also enters into commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase,  either  in  an  active,  highly  liquid  market  or  under  long-term,  unconditional  sales  contracts  with  similar  pricing  terms.  Ex amples  include  long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products at market prices. These commitments are not meaningful in assessing liquidity and cash flow, because the purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.\n\nTake-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase obligations are those long-term commitments that  are  noncancelable  or  cancelable  only  under  certain  conditions,  and  that  third  parties  have  used  to  secure  financing  for  the  facilities  that  will  provide  the contracted goods or services. These obligations mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. The total obligation at year-end 2024 for take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations was $49.9 billion. Cash payments expected in 2025 and 2026 are $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2024 for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management's estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence. G uarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital ex penditures or capital resources.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil projected benefit payments under Gross Other Postretirement Benefits to be $363 million in 2024, decreasing slightly to $339 million in 2028, with a total of $1,710 million expected from 2029 to 2033. By 2024, the company updated its projections, showing $356 million in expected payments for 2025, declining to $343 million by 2029, and a total of $1,752 million from 2030 to 2034. This indicates a slight increase in long-term obligations, particularly in the later years, despite a modest reduction in near-term payments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, chemical margins remained well below the 10-year range due to robust supply additions meeting continued demand growth. By 2024, the Corporation became subject to a more strategic framing of chemical margins as part of its broader Corporate Plan assumptions, which included price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, refinery and chemical margins, and greenhouse gas emissions pricing. This indicates a shift from reactive exposure to chemical margin pressures in 2023 toward a more integrated, forward-looking planning approach in 2024 that incorporates chemical margins into its long-term investment and risk management framework.",

        "In 2023, chemical margins were negatively impacted, remaining below the 10-year range due to supply outpacing demand.",

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

By 2024, this practice remained consistent, but the language evolved to emphasize that these assumptions were part of a broader set of economic inputs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing and foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a more integrated and dynamic planning process that adapts to emerging policy and market conditions.",

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

However, in 2024, the Chemical Products segment reported that weaker margins decreased earnings by $870 million due to bottom-of-cycle price conditions, as industry supply additions outpaced demand growth.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nIn the Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the Supplemental Information on Oil and G as Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation's price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.\n\nGlobal Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the G lobal Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation's demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, when assessing future cash flows, the Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. V olumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair  value  include  estimates  of  acreage  values  and  flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production  volumes,  throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government agencies), refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Properties, Plant and Equipment were noted in the context of a restructuring event that led to an increase in their valuation, partially offsetting a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. The company had significant tax loss carryforwards of $10,750 and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $11,718, which directly influenced the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. By 2024, the focus shifted to impairment risk, with the company detailing a more dynamic and conditional approach to assessing Properties, Plant and Equipment for impairment. The 2024 disclosures emphasize sensitivity to factors like commodity prices, carbon costs, and regulatory changes as triggers for impairment reviews, indicating a heightened awareness of external economic and regulatory pressures affecting asset valuation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "In 2022, the restructuring led to an increase in Properties, Plant and Equipment, and the valuation allowance was heavily influenced by tax loss and credit carryforwards ($10,750 and $11,718 respectively), showing a more static accounting treatment.",
        "In 2024, the company introduced a more nuanced and risk-based approach to impairment, explicitly linking Properties, Plant and Equipment valuation to volatile external factors such as commodity prices, carbon costs, and regulatory changes.",
        "The evolution from a restructuring-related increase in 2022 to a risk-sensitive impairment framework in 2024 indicates a strategic shift in how the company manages and accounts for its long-lived assets in response to market and regulatory uncertainty."

Deferred  tax  assets  decreased  by $2,780 from year-end 2020. This decrease was primarily related to decreases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations, and employee benefits, partially offset by the increase in foreign tax credits.\n\nThe overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management's assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2021, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $10,750 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $993, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2022 through 2040.

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,  given  the  broad  range  of  the  company's  PP&amp;E  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition\u2014factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions.

By 2024, the company maintained the same $10 billion total commitment through 2028, with the same internal allocation of $2 billion and $8 billion across the respective categories.

          "chunk_text": "Chevron supports the Paris Agreement's global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions  to  help  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  while  continuing  to  meet  the  need  for  energy  that  supports  society. Chevron  integrates  climate  change-related  issues  and  the  regulatory  and  other  responses  to  these  issues  into  its  strategy  and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company's long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated  laws  and  regulations  and  amount  of  additional  investments  in  new  or  existing  technology  or  facilities,  such  as  carbon capture  and  storage,  is  difficult  to  predict  with  certainty  and  is  expected  to  vary  depending  on  the  actual  laws  and  regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company's activities in it, and market conditions. As discussed in more detail below, the company has announced planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments.\n\nAlthough the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers' demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences. Chevron aims to  grow  its  traditional  oil  and  gas  business,  lower  the  carbon  intensity  of  its  operations  and  grow  lower  carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company's capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company's traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.\n\nIn 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:\n\n2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple  stakeholders,  continuing  progress  on  commercially  viable  technology,  government  policy,  successful  negotiations  for carbon  capture  and  storage  and  nature-based  projects,  availability  of  cost-effective,  verifiable  offsets  in  the  global  market,  and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n\n2028  Upstream  Production  GHG  Intensity  Targets These  metrics  include  Scope  1,  direct  emissions,  and  Scope  2,  indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:\n\n- 40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oilequivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- 26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- 53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- 66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company's progress toward its net zero aspiration.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's Upstream and  Downstream  business  and  includes  Scope  1  (direct  emissions),  Scope  2  (indirect  emissions  from  imported  electricity  and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016.\n\nPlanned  Lower-Carbon  Capital  Spend  through  2028 The  company  increased  its  planned  capital  spend  to  approximately  $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company",

The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include:\n\n- Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO e/boe), 2\n- Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO e/boe, 2\n- Methane intensity of 2 kg CO e/boe, and 2\n- Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO e/boe. 2\n\nThe company also targets zero routine flaring by 2030 as outlined in the World Bank's 'Zero Routine Flaring by 2030' initiative.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron's entire business. This metric encompasses the company's upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 2\n\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company's 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines.\n\nSince 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company's effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Tax es to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nComments related to earnings trends for the company's major business areas are as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe  company  is  actively  managing  its  schedule  of  work,  contracting,  procurement,  and  supply  chain  activities  to  effectively manage  costs  and  ensure  supply  chain  resiliency  and  continuity  in  support  of  operational  goals.  Third  party  costs  for  capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company's control including, but not limited to: severe  weather  or  civil  unrest,  delays  in  construction,  global  and  local  supply  chain  distribution  issues,  the  general  level  of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry's material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company's costs reflect changes in market trends.",

This metric encompasses the company's upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company's PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 2\n\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company's 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines.\n\nSince 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility.
