      "question": "How has the financial exposure and project scope of Linde's Engineering business in Russia evolved between 2023 and 2024, based on disclosed contract liabilities and project activities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Linde disclosed $418 million in contract liabilities related to engineering projects in Russia that were suspended and lawfully wound down due to sanctions. By 2024, there is no mention of ongoing engineering projects in Russia, and instead, the focus shifts to global engineering operations in locations such as Germany, France, the U.S., and China. This indicates a full withdrawal from Russian engineering projects and a reallocation of engineering resources to other regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2023, Linde reported $418 million in contract liabilities tied to suspended engineering projects in Russia due to sanctions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, the Engineering section highlights project activities in other global locations with no mention of Russia, indicating a full cessation of operations there.",
        "Step 3: The change reflects a strategic and operational shift away from Russia, reducing exposure and refocusing the Engineering business on other regions."

      "answer": "In 2023, Linde described its on-site product supply contracts as generally being total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10\u201320 years, containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10\u201320 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework. This suggests that Linde preserved its long-term, committed contract model for on-site supply without modification across the two reporting years.",

        "Step 1: In 2023, Linde disclosed that on-site contracts were total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10\u201320 years, including minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions.",
        "Step 2: In 2024, Linde again described on-site contracts using the exact same language, including the 10\u201320 year term range and inclusion of minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions.",
        "Step 3: Since the description and structure of total requirement contracts remained unchanged between 2023 and 2024, there was no evolution or modification in how Linde structured its long-term on-site supply agreements."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by providing additional context on its financial risk management practices, including the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest-rate swaps, currency-swap agreements, and forward contracts.

      "answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, Linde explicitly stated that 'consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices' within the 'On-site' section, indicating a direct link between external indices and contract pricing. In the 2024 10-K filing, while the company maintained identical language regarding the use of price indices in 'On-site' contracts, it did not expand on or further clarify the nature or extent of these pricing mechanisms. This suggests that while the company continues to use index-based pricing, it has not provided additional transparency into how these indices may impact revenue stability or variability. This lack of additional disclosure could make it more challenging for investors to assess the financial implications of index-linked pricing on Linde\u2019s revenue predictability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Identify state/situation in Year 1 \u2014 In 2023, Linde explicitly disclosed that on-site contracts used pricing based on various price indices, signaling a potential source of revenue volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Contracts with Customers\n\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\n\n## Industrial Gases\n\nWithin each of the company's geographic segments for industrial gases, there are three basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the three distribution methods.\n\nFollowing is a description of each of the three industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies:\n\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants.  Linde  constructs  plants  on  or  adjacent  to  these  customers'  sites  and  supplies  the  product  directly  to  customers  by  pipeline.  Where  there  are  large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical ex pedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.\n\nMerchant. Merchant deliveries generally are made from  Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances.  The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three  to seven year supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer's site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.\n\nThe company's performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store, and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation.",

      "question": "How did Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to managing cost fluctuations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: In 2022, cost pass-through was quantified as contributing 2% to sales changes, showing it played a minor but explicit role in sales variance.",
        "Step 2: In 2023, the company highlighted its long-term contracts as enabling the ability to pass through cost changes, framing it as a competitive advantage and strategic enabler.",
        "Step 3: The shift from a specific but modest quantitative impact in 2022 to a broader strategic emphasis in 2023 indicates that cost pass-through evolved from a marginal factor to a core financial strategy."

This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023.

By 2023, this mechanism had a negative impact of 6% on sales growth, indicating a shift in how cost pass-through affected the company's financial performance.

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde reported net purchases of ordinary shares amounting to $4,562 million, reflecting a significant use of cash for shareholder returns. By 2024, this figure decreased slightly to $4,451 million. This indicates that while the company remained committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, the level of activity in this area modestly declined over the two-year period. The reduction in share purchases coincided with an increase in dividends paid, which rose to $2,655 million in 2024, suggesting a potential shift in emphasis toward dividend distributions as part of the company's broader shareholder return approach. The overall cash deployment strategy appears to remain consistent, but with a slight recalibration in the mix between share repurchases and dividends.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

Sales increased 2% from higher price attainment primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments. Sales from volume were flat as growth from new project start-ups was offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, decreased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, largely in the Americas and APAC.\n- Reported operating profit of $8,635 million was 8% above 2023 reported operating profit of $8,024 million. Adjusted operating profit of $9,720 million was 7% above 2023 adjusted operating profit of $9,070 million. The increase in the reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives in 2024. These increases more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation and currency translation.*\n- Net income - Linde plc of $6,565 million and diluted earnings per share of $13.62 increased from $6,199 million and $12.59, respectively in 2023. Adjusted net income - Linde plc of $7,475 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.51 were 7% above 2023 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,423 million was $118 million above 2023. The increase was driven by higher net income, partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $4,497 million; dividends paid were $2,655 million; net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million; and debt borrowings, net were $3,167 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2025 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",
