      "answer": "The total gross amount carried at the close of the current period for AMT's 222,830 sites is $21,929.3 million, and for SPG's Southridge Mall it is $156,653 million. Combined, this totals $178,582.3 million. The accumulated depreciation for AMT's 222,830 sites is $8,986.9 million, and for SPG's Southridge Mall it is $69,585 million, totaling $78,571.9 million.

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently affect their tax obligations and income distribution strategies, based on their respective 2023 disclosures?",
      "answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, provided it distributes substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders. However, it must pay taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, AMT\u2019s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing, most of its U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets, which indicates that its TRSs are a limited but necessary part of its structure for engaging in non-REIT-qualified activities. In contrast, SPG also operates as a REIT and owns securities in TRSs, but it is subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with TRSs if not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. SPG must also ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs. This constraint affects SPG\u2019s flexibility in managing TRS investments and requires careful monitoring to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties. Therefore, while both companies use TRSs to engage in non-REIT activities, AMT appears to integrate TRSs more directly into its international operations, whereas SPG must manage TRS ownership more restrictively to avoid tax penalties and maintain REIT compliance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMT's 2023 10-K - AMT operates as a REIT and pays taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs, while its REIT-qualified businesses include U.S. tower leasing, most U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from SPG's 2023 10-K - SPG owns securities in TRSs and must ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs, and that transactions with TRSs are conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis to avoid a 100% excise tax.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG use TRSs to engage in non-REIT-qualified activities, but the structure and constraints differ. AMT integrates TRSs into its international operations with a focus on maintaining REIT compliance, while SPG must manage TRS investments more restrictively to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties."

      "question": "How does the difference in lease structure and tenant dependency between AMT and SPG affect their respective financial exposure to tenant lease disruptions?",
      "answer": "AMT, as a communications infrastructure lessor, structures its leases with fixed escalation clauses, financial penalties for early termination, and typically has multiple tenants per site, which minimizes residual value risk and stabilizes revenue. In contrast, SPG, which operates retail properties, faces greater exposure to tenant lease disruptions due to competition from e-commerce, evolving consumer behavior, and the potential for reduced occupancy and rental rates from oversupply or underperformance of non-retail tenants. This makes SPG more vulnerable to revenue volatility compared to AMT, which benefits from more stable, long-term lease arrangements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's lease arrangements typically have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, escalation clauses, and financial penalties for early termination, minimizing residual value risk.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG faces risks from oversupply of retail space, reduced market rents, and tenant underperformance due to e-commerce competition and evolving consumer behavior.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s structured lease terms and multi-tenant model reduce financial exposure from individual tenant disruptions, while SPG\u2019s reliance on retail tenants and exposure to market shifts increases its financial vulnerability to lease disruptions."

      "question": "How does the difference in lease renewal risk between AMT and SPG affect their respective revenue stability, given AMT's 3% churn rate and SPG's exposure to tenant defaults due to e-commerce shifts?",
      "answer": "AMT maintains revenue stability through long-term leases with wireless carriers and a low churn rate of 3%, supported by contractual rent escalations and high lease renewal rates. In contrast, SPG faces greater revenue instability due to its reliance on retail tenants vulnerable to e-commerce shifts, which could lead to higher default rates and reduced occupancy. This difference in lease renewal risk means AMT has more predictable cash flows, while SPG is more exposed to market volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT has a churn rate of approximately 3% and benefits from long-term leases with wireless carriers, high renewal rates, and contractual rent escalations averaging 3% annually in the U.S.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG faces risks from e-commerce shifts that could lead to store closures, lower occupancy, and reduced willingness of tenants to pay lease rates, directly impacting revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s tenant base (wireless carriers) has high renewal rates and long-term commitments, leading to stable revenue. SPG\u2019s retail tenants are more vulnerable to external shifts (e-commerce), increasing lease default risk and reducing revenue predictability. The difference in lease renewal risk directly affects each company's revenue stability."

      "answer": "Both AMT and SPG, as REITs, are required to distribute a minimum amount of their income to maintain their tax-advantaged status, which creates financial pressure in managing capital allocation. SPG plans to reinvest $94 million from international joint ventures for future development, balancing growth initiatives with shareholder returns through dividends. Similarly, AMT highlights uncertainty in the 'amount and timing of any future distributions' due to factors like capital constraints, debt obligations, and the need to fund liquidity requirements. Both companies must navigate the tension between reinvesting in growth opportunities and meeting REIT-mandated distributions, which can constrain financial flexibility and influence strategic decisions.",

      "answer": "AMT relies heavily on tenant leases as a source of recurring revenue, with the majority of its property operations generating revenue from multiyear contracts. This recurring revenue is critical for maintaining cash flow from operating activities. In contrast, SPG faces significant risks that could negatively impact tenant lease performance, including shifts in consumer behavior toward e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to public health crises, and the potential for tenants to underreport sales, which affects overage rent collection. These external factors could materially and adversely affect SPG\u2019s occupancy levels and lease rates, directly impacting its revenue and asset value. Thus, while AMT benefits from the stability of long-term tenant leases, SPG is more exposed to volatility due to changing market and health conditions that influence tenant performance.",

The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board.\n\nAsset Retirement ObligationsWe are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2024, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.5 billion.\n\n## Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\n\nOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor's understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.\n\nInternally Generated Funds -Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2024 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our ex isting communications infrastructure.\n\nRestrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities -Each Bank Loan Agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The Bank Loan Agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.\n\n",

      "question": "Considering the tenant lease structures and risks described by both AMT and SPG, how does the difference in lease expiration profiles (2030 and beyond for 52% of AMT's leases vs. SPG's exposure to short-term tenant uncertainties) impact their respective long-term revenue stability?",
      "answer": "AMT benefits from a more stable long-term revenue outlook due to 52% of its tenant leases expiring in 2030 or beyond, which provides extended contractual income visibility and reduces exposure to near-term market volatility. In contrast, SPG faces greater uncertainty in revenue stability because its properties are more exposed to short-term tenant risks, such as retail store closures, consumer foot traffic fluctuations, and the impact of external events like crime or public health crises, which can disrupt tenant performance and leasing goals. This contrast in lease duration profiles means AMT is better insulated from near-term market shifts, while SPG must navigate more immediate tenant and consumer behavior risks that could directly affect its leasing revenue and asset value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMT's filing - 52% of current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2030 or beyond, indicating long-term lease stability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from SPG's filing - The company faces risks related to tenant performance, consumer foot traffic, and external disruptions (e.g., crime, public health crises), which could negatively impact leasing goals and revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s long lease durations reduce exposure to market volatility, while SPG\u2019s shorter-term tenant dynamics and external risk factors create more immediate financial uncertainty."

In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets.\n\n- A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located on a tract of land of up to 20 acres.\n- A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.\n- A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.\n- Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Africa &amp; APAC, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.\n\nU.S. &amp; Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2024, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2018 and March 2023 (the '2018 Securitization' and the '2023 Securitization', respectively, and together, the 'Trust Securitizations') is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,029 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the 'Trust Sites') and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the '2015 Securitization') are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,338 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the '2015 Secured Sites').\n\nThere are no encumbered sites in our Africa &amp; APAC, Europe or Latin America property segments or in our Data Centers segment.\n\nGround Leases. Of the 148,097 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2024, approximately 80% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter longterm ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 56% of the ground leases for our sites have a final ex piration date of 2034 and beyond.\n\nCustomers . Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (19%), AT&amp;T (18%) and Verizon Wireless (13%).\n\nAcross most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 52% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2030 or beyond.\n\nData Centers. We own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2024, our data center portfolio consisted of 29 data center facilities across ten United States markets, across 3.3 million net rentable square feet ('NRSF').\n\nOffices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 100,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. &amp; Canada, Africa &amp; APAC, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.",

This suggests that AMT relied more heavily on external financing through noncontrolling interests compared to SPG. For AMT, these contributions directly offset a portion of the $49.9 million distributed to noncontrolling interest holders, effectively balancing its noncontrolling interest-related financing activities. For SPG, the $9.807 million in contributions was significantly smaller than its $21,049 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, indicating a net cash outflow in this category.

      "answer": "SPG reported Repairs and Maintenance Expenses of $93,595 for the period ended December 31, 2022. AMT, on the other hand, only mentions Repairs and Maintenance Expenses qualitatively as part of its Property Operations Expenses without providing any explicit numerical value. This lack of numerical disclosure by AMT makes it difficult to directly compare the real estate operational costs between the two companies, as SPG\u2019s detailed financial reporting allows for specific benchmarking, while AMT\u2019s qualitative description does not provide sufficient data for quantitative analysis.",

Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level ex penses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.",

      "answer": "AMT's lease structure, which includes fixed escalation clauses, financial penalties for early termination, and minimal residual value risk due to multi-tenancy and long-term site usability, reduces financial risk from tenant lease performance. In contrast, SPG faces higher financial risk because its retail tenants are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic from safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and public health crises, all of which could directly impact SPG's occupancy levels, lease rates, and overage rent collection.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AMT structures leases with fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index-based increases and imposes financial penalties for early termination, which disincentivizes tenants from ending leases prematurely.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, AMT typically has more than one tenant per site and can re-lease sites beyond existing lease terms, minimizing residual value risk.",
        "Step 3: From evidence_source_b, SPG's revenue is directly impacted by consumer foot traffic and tenant performance, both of which are vulnerable to safety concerns, e-commerce shifts, and public health events.",
        "Step 4: From evidence_source_b, SPG faces risks of reduced occupancy and lease rates due to competition from e-commerce and omni-channel retailing, and potential underreporting of sales by tenants, which affects overage rent collection."

The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee.\n\nLessor -The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company's communications real estate assets. The Company's lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fix ed escalation percentage or an inflationary index , or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the ex piration of the lease term.\n\nThe Company's leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer's underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fix ed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\n\nThe Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets.",

T o the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nActs of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity, actual or threatened terrorist attacks and inappropriate and unacceptable behavior by consumers at our properties could adversely affect our business operations.\n\nBecause our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest and crim inal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that m ay be beyond our control or ability to prevent, and recently there has been an increased risk of organized retail crim e and physical violence, the severity and frequency of which varies by m arket and location.

Additionally, the increase in online shopping m ay result in certain tenants underreporting sales at our properties which m ay materially and adversely im pact our collection of overage rent. E xam ples m ay include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up  sales  or  online  sales  fulfilled  with  store  inventory,  and  tenants  reducing  reported  store  sales  by  including  online  returns processed in the store\n\nEpidemics, pandemics or other public health crisis, and governmental reactions thereto, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants' business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our  ability  to  access  the  capital  markets,  satisfy  our  debt  service  obligations  and  make  distributions  to  our shareholders.\n\nEpidem ics, pandem ics or other health crises could have, a m aterial negative im pact on econom ic and m arket conditions around the  world  and  an  adverse  im pact  on  econom ic  activity  in  retail  real  estate.

As a result of the redemption, we now hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe. We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion, with a current portion of $4.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans and the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2022, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $292.4 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs.

      "answer": "American Tower Corporation reported a 35% year-over-year increase in Nareit FFO attributable to common stockholders, rising from $3,510.8 million in 2020 to $4,753.3 million in 2021. In contrast, Simon Property Group identified FFO as a key non-GAAP performance metric but faced significant operational disruptions due to the pandemic, including the loss of approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, primarily in Q2, which materially impacted revenue recognition due to uncertainty in collecting lease income and led to asset impairment charges.

We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward  criteria.  We  selectively  develop  new  properties  in  markets  we  believe  are  not  adequately  served  by existing retail outlet properties.\n\nWe routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international  strategy  includes  partnering  with  established  real  estate  companies  and  financing  international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.\n\nTo support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:\n\n- provide the capital necessary to fund growth,\n- maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and\n- manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.\n\nWe  consider  FFO,  net  operating  income,  or  NOI,  and  portfolio  NOI  to  be  key  measures  of  operating performance that  are  not  specifically  defined  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines are being administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and  other  authorities,  including  where  we  own  or  hold  interests  in  properties,  have  imposed  at  times  measures intended  to  control  its  spread,  including  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement,  group  gatherings  and  business operations  such  as  travel  bans,  border  closings,  business  closures,  quarantines,  stay-at-home,  shelter-in-place orders, capacity limitations and social distancing measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these periodic measures, the Company has experienced material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to  changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties and investments.  Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter.\n\nAs we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended  to  prevent  its  spread  on  our  business,  our  primary  focus  has  been  on  the  health  and  safety  of  our employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve.  In the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the  property  closures,  we  implemented  a  series  of  actions  to  reduce  costs  and  increase  liquidity  in  light  of  the economic impacts of the pandemic, including:\n\n- significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending,\n- significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend,\n- implemented  a  temporary  furlough  of  certain  corporate  and  field  employees  due  to  the  closure  of  the Company's U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and\n- suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects.",

      "question": "How does the differing dependence on occupancy rates between AMT and SPG influence their respective strategies for increasing revenue from existing real estate assets in 2022?",
      "answer": "AMT focuses on increasing occupancy of its communications real estate by leasing additional space on existing towers, anticipating growing demand driven by 4G densification and 5G deployments in the U.S. and advanced network technologies internationally. This strategy is expected to generate incremental returns by utilizing existing capacity or upgrading towers with modest investment. In contrast, SPG's retail real estate revenue depends heavily on occupancy rates, which were negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer willingness to visit properties and increased reliance on e-commerce. SPG faces challenges in renewing leases or re-leasing available space on favorable terms due to deteriorating market conditions and tenant financial instability, making it more difficult to increase revenue from existing properties. Therefore, while AMT's strategy is positioned for growth through increased occupancy, SPG's strategy is constrained by external risks affecting occupancy and tenant viability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT aims to increase occupancy on its existing communications sites to support global connectivity and drive returns, citing 4G densification and 5G deployments as key drivers of demand in the U.S., with similar trends in international markets.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG notes that demand for retail space and profitability depends on tenants' ability and willingness to perform under leases, which has been negatively affected by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer traffic and increased e-commerce adoption.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The differing dependence on occupancy rates leads to contrasting strategies: AMT is actively pursuing higher occupancy through network expansion and tower upgrades, while SPG faces occupancy-related headwinds that limit its ability to grow revenue from existing properties."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4G network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.\n- Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers' needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program and acquisitions. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future.\n- Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n- Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2021, had $6.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\n\n## Capital Allocation Strategy\n\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies.\n\n- Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions.\n- Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others.\n- Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs.",

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in properties, have  imposed  measures  intended  to  control  its  spread,  including  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement,  group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-athome, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. Governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures. However, governments and other authorities have already been forced to, and others may in the future, reinstitute these measures or impose new, more restrictive measures, if the risks,  or  the  tenants'  and  consumers'  perception  of  the  risks,  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic worsen at any time. Although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, with tenants adding services like curbside pickup, and while consumer risk-tolerance is evolving, such adaptations and evolution may  take  time,  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  retail  will  return  to  pre-pandemic  levels  even  once  the  pandemic subsides.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned or held an interest in 199 income-producing properties in the United States  located  in  37  states  and  Puerto  Rico.  We  also  own  an  80%  noncontrolling  interest  in  TRG,  which  has  an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2021, we had ownership interests in 33 properties primarily located in Asia, Europe and Canada and have two international outlet properties under development. We have an interest in a European investee that has interests in 11 Designer Outlet properties, as more fully described elsewhere in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2021, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre SA, or Kl\u00e9pierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.\n\nDemand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases. Although the harshest restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19  have  generally  been  lifted  or  reduced,  and  vaccines  are  being  administered  in  the  United  States  and elsewhere, the willingness of customers to visit our properties may be reduced and our tenants' businesses adversely affected,  based  upon  many  factors,  including  local  transmission  rates,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the development,  availability,  distribution,  effectiveness  and  acceptance  of  existing  and  new  vaccines,  and  the effectiveness  and  availability  of  cures  or  treatments.    Further,  demand  could  remain  reduced  due  to  heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of COVID-19 or other associated diseases.  In addition, some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants' businesses have been, and may be in the future, heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel.\n\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors, including:\n\n- the financial condition and viability of our tenants, and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full;\n- state, local, federal and industry-initiated tenant relief efforts that may adversely affect landlords, including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent;\n- the increased popularity and utilization of e-commerce;\n- our  ability  to  renew  leases  or  re-lease  available  space  in  our  properties  on  favorable  terms  or  at  all, including as a result of a deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we own properties or due to restrictions intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including any additional government mandated closures of businesses that frustrate our leasing activities;",
