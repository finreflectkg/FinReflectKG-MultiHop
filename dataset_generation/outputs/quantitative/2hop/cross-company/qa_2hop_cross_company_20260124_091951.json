      "question": "What is the combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for DUK and NEE in 2023, and how does the difference between the two companies' amounts reflect their contrasting capital structures and financing strategies?",
      "answer": "The combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $2,910 million. Duke Energy paid $447 million, while NextEra Energy paid $2,463 million. This significant difference reflects NEE\u2019s much larger capital expenditures and debt financing activity compared to DUK, as seen in NEE\u2019s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows versus DUK\u2019s $773 million. NEE\u2019s higher interest payments are a direct result of its larger debt load used to fund major investments, including $15.5 billion in independent power and other investments, compared to DUK\u2019s $991 million in long-term debt issuances.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized in 2023 is $447 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy's Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized in 2023 is $2,463 million.",
        "Step 3: Add both figures to calculate the combined total: $447 million + $2,463 million = $2,910 million.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the difference: NEE paid $2,016 million more than DUK, which is due to NEE\u2019s significantly higher capital expenditures ($15.565 billion in independent power investments) and long-term debt financing ($13.857 billion issued) compared to DUK\u2019s more modest capital spending and financing activity ($991 million in long-term debt proceeds).",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The contrast in interest payments reflects differing capital structures and investment strategies: NEE is deploying significantly more capital in growth investments, funded largely by debt, while DUK maintains a more conservative financing approach."

NextEra Energy has $1,021 million related to interim removal costs and $14 million related to other generation plant dismantlement that are included in noncurrent regulatory assets instead of liabilities.

      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of the end of 2023 is $2,943 million. Duke Energy reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,741 million. This indicates that NEE has a significantly larger exposure to long-term derivative obligations compared to DUK, which may reflect differences in their hedging strategies, commodity exposure, or financial structuring.",

Together, their combined noncurrent derivative assets total $1,906 million. NEE's position accounts for approximately 93.9% of the combined total, indicating that NEE has a substantially larger long-term exposure to derivative instruments compared to Duke Energy.",

      "answer": "The combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $2,621 million ($158 million for DUK and $2,463 million for NEE). This significant interest expense could constrain capital investment by reducing available cash flow for both companies. For example, DUK reported capital expenditures of $939 million in 2023, while NEE reported capital expenditures of $9,302 million for FPL and $15,565 million for NEER. The high interest burden may influence these companies to prioritize projects with quicker returns, seek external financing, or delay non-essential investments to maintain financial stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK's Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized in 2023 is $158 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NEE's Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized in 2023 is $2,463 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined interest expense: $158 million (DUK) + $2,463 million (NEE) = $2,621 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source A - DUK's capital expenditures in 2023 were $939 million.",
        "Step 5: Extract from source B - NEE's capital expenditures were $9,302 million for FPL and $15,565 million for NEER in 2023.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - The combined interest expense of $2.6 billion could reduce available cash for capital investments, potentially influencing DUK and NEE to adjust their investment strategies by prioritizing high-return projects, seeking additional financing, or delaying non-essential projects."

This significant difference suggests that NEE has a much larger long-term exposure to derivative instruments compared to Duke Energy.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative assets total $91 million as of December 31, 2023.",

      "question": "How did the changes in current regulatory assets related to storm restoration and deferred clause expenses at NEE, combined with Duke Energy's (DUK) increase in current regulatory assets, affect their respective noncurrent regulatory asset balances in 2023?",
      "answer": "NEE experienced a decrease in current regulatory assets from $2,165 million in 2022 to $1,460 million in 2023, largely due to a significant drop in deferred clause expenses from $1,227 million to $6 million and a decrease in storm restoration costs from $911 million to $35 million. This reduction in current regulatory assets contributed to a decrease in NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets from $5,992 million to $4,801 million. Meanwhile, Duke Energy (DUK) reported an increase in its current portion of regulatory assets from $1,095 million in 2022 to $1,564 million in 2023, which likely contributed to a smaller decrease in its noncurrent regulatory assets from $4,293 million to $3,916 million. Therefore, while both companies saw declines in noncurrent regulatory assets, NEE's larger drop was driven by significant reductions in current regulatory asset categories related to storm restoration and deferred clause expenses, whereas DUK's smaller decrease was influenced by an increase in its current regulatory assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK's current regulatory assets increased from $1,095 million (2022) to $1,564 million (2023), and its noncurrent regulatory assets decreased from $4,293 million (2022) to $3,916 million (2023).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE's current regulatory assets decreased from $2,165 million (2022) to $1,460 million (2023), and its noncurrent regulatory assets decreased from $5,992 million (2022) to $4,801 million (2023).",
        "Step 3: Analyze NEE's specific regulatory asset changes - NEE's drop in current regulatory assets was primarily due to a decrease in deferred clause expenses from $1,227 million to $6 million and a drop in storm restoration costs from $911 million to $35 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The decrease in NEE's current regulatory assets (especially deferred clause expenses and storm restoration costs) contributed to a larger decline in its noncurrent regulatory assets compared to DUK. DUK's increase in current regulatory assets helped buffer its noncurrent regulatory asset decline."

      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2022, is $3,111 million. Duke Energy reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,909 million. This significant difference highlights that NextEra Energy has a much greater long-term exposure to derivative obligations compared to Duke Energy, which may reflect differences in hedging strategies, commodity exposure, or financial structuring.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities total $202 million as of December 31, 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities total $2,909 million as of December 31, 2022.",
        "Step 3: Combine both figures - $202 million (DUK) + $2,909 million (NEE) = $3,111 million in total noncurrent derivative liabilities.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the difference - The disparity between $202 million and $2,909 million indicates differing levels of long-term derivative exposure, potentially due to distinct risk management strategies or market positions."

      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities reported by Duke Energy and NextEra Energy (NEE) as of December 31, 2023, is $2,317 million. Duke Energy reports $217 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, while NEE reports $2,101 million. The structure of these liabilities differs significantly between the two companies. Duke Energy's Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities are distributed across multiple business units, such as Duke Energy Carolinas ($29 million), Progress Energy ($35 million), and Piedmont ($127 million), after accounting for offsets and cash collateral. In contrast, NEE's Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities are presented as a single aggregated amount of $2,101 million, indicating a more consolidated approach to derivative reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy reports $217 million in Net Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities across various business units (e.g., Duke Energy Carolinas: $29 million, Progress Energy: $35 million, Piedmont: $127 million).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NextEra Energy (NEE) reports $2,101 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities as a single line item.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined total - $217 million (Duke Energy) + $2,101 million (NEE) = $2,317 million.",
        "Step 4: Contrast the structure of liabilities - Duke Energy breaks down its Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities by business unit with offsets and collateral accounted for, while NEE presents a consolidated figure without unit-level detail."

This difference impacts the projected growth of pension obligations, as higher salary increases lead to larger future liabilities. Consequently, NEE's pension obligations, when projected using its higher salary assumption, would grow faster than DUK's, making direct comparisons of their pension liabilities less meaningful without adjusting for this key assumption.",

This interest expense is significantly lower than their respective capital expenditures, which were $939 million for DUK and $9,302 million for NEE in 2023. Specifically, the interest expense represents about 128% of DUK\u2019s capital expenditures but only about 12.8% of NEE\u2019s capital expenditures, highlighting different financial leverage and investment dynamics between the two companies.",

However, NEE also had significantly higher noncurrent regulatory liabilities at $10,049 million compared to Duke's $5,990 million, resulting in a much larger net regulatory liability for NEE ($10,049M - $4,801M = $5,248M) than Duke ($5,990M - $3,916M = $2,074M), meaning NEE's net regulatory liability exceeds Duke's by $3,174 million.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023, and how does the difference between their respective liabilities reflect differences in their regulatory environments related to asset retirement obligations?",
      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $24,088 million. Duke Energy reports $14,039 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities, while NextEra Energy reports $10,049 million. The difference of $3,990 million is largely due to Duke Energy having significantly higher asset retirement obligations ($8,560 million) compared to NextEra Energy's asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference ($4,066 million), indicating that Duke Energy faces a more immediate burden in asset retirement costs, which are likely tied to older infrastructure or differing regulatory requirements across their service territories.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy (DUK) reports $14,039 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy (NEE) reports $10,049 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for 2023.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined total - $14,039 million (DUK) + $10,049 million (NEE) = $24,088 million.",
        "Step 4: Compare key components - Duke Energy's asset retirement obligations are $8,560 million, while NextEra Energy's largest related item is the asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference at $4,066 million.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The difference in liabilities reflects varying regulatory environments, particularly around asset retirement obligations, which may be influenced by the age and type of infrastructure, regional regulations, and utility models."

      "answer": "NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative assets total $1,935 million compared to Duke Energy's $116 million, making NEE's position $1,819 million greater. This significant difference reflects that NextEra Energy holds a much larger portfolio of long-term derivative contracts, particularly in commodity, interest rate, and foreign currency contracts, which are categorized under noncurrent assets on their balance sheet. Duke Energy, by contrast, reports a much smaller noncurrent derivative position, indicating less exposure to long-term derivative instruments.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative assets amount to $116 million as of December 31, 2022.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $1,935 million (NEE) - $116 million (DUK) = $1,819 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The difference highlights contrasting strategies in long-term derivative exposure, with NEE maintaining significantly larger noncurrent derivative assets."

The proportion of these liabilities differs significantly, with NEE carrying a larger share due to its higher noncurrent regulatory liabilities.",

      "answer": "DUK reported a Salary Increase range of 3.50% - 4.00% for each of the years 2021 through 2023, while NEE reported a specific Salary Increase of 4.90% for 2023. The higher salary increase assumption at NEE implies a faster-growing benefit obligation compared to DUK, which could lead to a larger liability on NEE's financial statements if other actuarial assumptions (like discount rate and employee demographics) are held constant. This contrast in salary increase assumptions suggests that NEE may be recognizing a more aggressive growth in employee compensation, which would increase the present value of pension obligations more significantly than under DUK's more moderate and consistent assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK's Salary Increase is consistently reported as a range of 3.50% - 4.00% from 2021 to 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE's Salary Increase is reported as a fixed 4.90% for 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in assumptions (range vs. fixed, and lower vs. higher value) implies divergent actuarial approaches to projecting future benefit obligations, with NEE's assumption likely leading to higher liability growth."

      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2022, is $3,094 million. Duke Energy reported $185 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,909 million. This significant difference indicates that NextEra Energy had a much larger long-term risk exposure tied to derivative contracts, which could imply greater sensitivity to market fluctuations or a more aggressive hedging strategy compared to Duke Energy.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities are $185 million as of December 31, 2022.",

      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $2,286 million. Duke Energy reports $244 million in gross Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, while NEE reports $2,101 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's gross Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities of $244 million are disclosed in the 2023 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy's Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities of $2,101 million are disclosed in their 2023 10-K filing.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Add both values ($244M + $2,101M) to determine the combined total of $2,345 million. However, since Duke Energy's offset of $59 million is directly tied to its Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, we subtract that offset to reflect the net liability of $185 million for Duke Energy. The final combined total is $185M (Duke Energy net) + $2,101M (NEE) = $2,286 million."

      "answer": "NEE\u2019s 2023 10-K states that its gas infrastructure business, which includes investments in gas and oil producing and transmission assets, is exposed to fluctuating market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER\u2019s gas infrastructure business, leading to project delays, cancellations, or impairments. This could reduce the profitability or value of NEE\u2019s investments in gas infrastructure. Since Duke Energy (DUK) has a stake in gas infrastructure through its $17.4 billion goodwill allocation to EU&I and $1.9 billion to GU&I, a sustained downturn in gas and oil prices could reduce the fair value of these reporting units, potentially triggering goodwill impairment charges in the future if fair value falls below carrying value.",

      "question": "How much of Progress Energy's total remaining performance obligations as disclosed by Duke Energy in 2022 were attributed to its Florida segment, and what might this indicate about the significance of that business unit in relation to NEE's stake in Progress Energy?",
      "answer": "Progress Energy's total remaining performance obligations as disclosed by Duke Energy in 2022 were $264 million, of which $240 million were attributed to the Florida segment. This indicates that the Florida segment represents the vast majority (approximately 91%) of Progress Energy's future revenue commitments, suggesting it plays a central role in the value of Progress Energy. Given that NEE has a stake in Progress Energy, this large concentration of obligations in the Florida segment likely represents a significant component of NEE\u2019s financial interest in the entity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source DUK_10k_2022.pdf - Progress Energy's total remaining performance obligations are $264 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source DUK_10k_2022.pdf - Duke Energy Florida's remaining performance obligations are $240 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the proportion of Progress Energy's obligations attributed to Florida: $240M / $264M \u2248 91%.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize with NEE's stake in Progress Energy - Since NEE holds a stake in Progress Energy, the majority of its financial exposure or upside would be tied to the performance of Progress Energy\u2019s major segments, particularly Florida."

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) classifies its equity investments in Progress Energy as FV-NI (Fair Value Through Net Income), which means changes in fair value directly impact its net income. This classification affects financial volatility, as any market value changes of these investments are immediately recognized in earnings. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) also has a stake in Progress Energy but does not disclose a similar classification or fair value estimation method, suggesting a potentially different accounting treatment or reporting transparency. Without details from NEE on how it classifies or reports its stake, it is difficult to directly compare the financial impact of Progress Energy on both companies' financial statements.",

      "question": "How did the changes in noncurrent regulatory assets at DUK from 2020 to 2021 compare to the changes in noncurrent regulatory assets at NEE due to reserve amortization, and what was the combined impact on their balance sheets?",
      "answer": "DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $656 million from 2020 ($5,775 million) to 2021 ($5,909 million). NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were impacted by reserve amortization adjustments related to accrued asset removal costs, which reflected changes in regulatory ROE targeting under the 2016 rate agreement. These adjustments were recorded as increases or decreases to noncurrent regulatory assets or liabilities. The combined impact of these changes indicates that both companies experienced regulatory-driven balance sheet adjustments, with DUK showing a direct increase in noncurrent regulatory assets while NEE's changes were more dynamic due to amortization reversals and accruals.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased from $5,775 million in 2020 to $5,909 million in 2021, representing a $134 million increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were affected by reserve amortization adjustments, which reflected changes in accrued asset removal costs under the 2016 rate agreement to achieve targeted regulatory ROE, with specific impacts on noncurrent regulatory assets and liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - DUK's increase in noncurrent regulatory assets was a direct financial change, while NEE's changes were more complex, involving regulatory mechanisms and amortization adjustments. Both companies experienced balance sheet impacts related to regulatory assets, but the nature and magnitude of change differed based on their specific regulatory environments."

      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Assets for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2021, is $1,228 million. Duke Energy reported $116 million in noncurrent derivative assets, while NextEra Energy reported $1,135 million. The significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy employs a more extensive long-term hedging strategy or has larger long-term commodity, interest rate, or foreign currency exposures compared to Duke Energy, which may reflect a more aggressive or diversified risk management approach in managing future price volatility.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) as of the end of 2021, and how does the distribution of these liabilities across contract types reflect differences in their risk exposure strategies?",
      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of the end of 2021 is $1,316 million. Duke Energy reported $117 million in noncurrent commodity contracts and $21 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts designated as hedging instruments, and $132 million in noncurrent commodity contracts and $18 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts not designated as hedging instruments. NextEra Energy reported $1,199 million in total noncurrent derivative liabilities, with $500 million in noncurrent commodity contracts, $1,001 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts, and $9 million in noncurrent foreign currency contracts. Duke Energy's strategy appears to focus more on short-term hedging with current liabilities, while NextEra Energy holds significantly more in noncurrent interest rate contracts, indicating a longer-term financial risk management approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy reported $117 million in noncurrent commodity contracts and $21 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts designated as hedging instruments, and $132 million in noncurrent commodity contracts and $18 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts not designated as hedging instruments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy reported $1,199 million in total noncurrent derivative liabilities, including $500 million in noncurrent commodity contracts, $1,001 million in noncurrent interest rate contracts, and $9 million in noncurrent foreign currency contracts.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities ($117M + $21M + $132M + $18M = $288M) with NextEra Energy's total of $1,199 million to arrive at the combined total of $1,316 million. Analyze the distribution differences: Duke Energy shows a more balanced mix across hedging designations, while NextEra Energy has a heavy emphasis on interest rate contracts, suggesting differing risk exposure strategies."

      "answer": "The return on equity (ROE) of Progress Energy in 2021 was 3.1%, while the average ROE of Duke Energy's other operating segments in the same year was approximately 2.9%. This suggests that Progress Energy outperformed the average of Duke Energy\u2019s other segments in 2021, potentially indicating stronger capital efficiency or profitability within that segment during the period.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Progress Energy's ROE in 2021 was 3.1%.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the average ROE of Duke Energy's other segments: (2.7% + 3.0% + 3.3% + 2.9% + 3.6% + 2.1%) / 6 = 2.9%.",
        "Step 4: Compare Progress Energy\u2019s 2021 ROE (3.1%) to the calculated average of other segments (2.9%), showing that Progress Energy outperformed the average of the other segments by 0.2 percentage points.",
        "Step 5: Interpret the result: This could indicate that Progress Energy was more efficient in generating returns from equity capital compared to the rest of Duke Energy\u2019s business in 2021."

      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2021, is $3,129 million. Duke Energy reported $132 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments, while NextEra Energy reported $2,997 million (calculated as $2,198 million total derivative liabilities for commodity contracts minus $1,201 million current derivative liabilities for commodity contracts). This significant combined exposure indicates that both companies have substantial long-term obligations tied to commodity price fluctuations that are not offset by hedging strategies, increasing their financial risk in volatile markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy reported $132 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy reported $2,198 million total derivative liabilities for commodity contracts and $1,201 million current derivative liabilities for commodity contracts (calculated as $2,571 million Level 1 + $4,990 million Level 2 + $1,231 million Level 3 - $6,594 million netting for current liabilities = $1,201 million).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - To determine NextEra's noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments, subtract current liabilities ($1,201 million) from total liabilities ($2,198 million), resulting in $997 million. Add this to Duke Energy's $132 million to calculate the combined total of $3,129 million."

      "question": "How does the change in noncurrent regulatory liabilities for DUK between 2020 and 2021 compare to NEE's regulatory treatment related to reserve amortization adjustments reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets and liabilities?",
      "answer": "For DUK, noncurrent regulatory liabilities increased from $1,044 million in 2020 to $1,058 million in 2021, reflecting a $14 million increase. For NEE, reserve amortization adjustments caused shifts in regulatory balances, with the reversal of reserve amortization in 2020 contributing to the balance in noncurrent regulatory liabilities, and reserve amortization in 2021 shifting the balance to noncurrent regulatory assets. This indicates contrasting regulatory dynamics: DUK experienced a minor upward adjustment in liabilities, while NEE's regulatory treatment involved more dynamic shifts tied to achieving targeted ROE adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK's noncurrent regulatory liabilities increased from $1,044 million (2020) to $1,058 million (2021), showing a $14 million increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE's regulatory treatment involved reversal of reserve amortization in 2020 (contributing to noncurrent regulatory liabilities) and reserve amortization in 2021 (reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The comparison reveals differing regulatory impacts: DUK's minor liability increase contrasts with NEE's dynamic regulatory adjustments driven by reserve amortization changes tied to achieving targeted ROE."

Meanwhile, NextEra Energy (NEE) experienced a shift in its noncurrent regulatory assets and liabilities due to reserve amortization adjustments tied to the 2016 rate agreement. Specifically, NEE recorded reserve amortization in 2021, which increased noncurrent regulatory assets, contrasting with the reversal of reserve amortization in 2020 that had increased regulatory liabilities. This mechanism directly affects NEE\u2019s financial positioning by aligning accrued asset removal costs with targeted regulatory returns, while DUK\u2019s increase in noncurrent regulatory assets suggests a similar, though less explicitly detailed, regulatory adjustment process.",

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the  targeted  regulatory  ROE.  Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 -Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization - for discussion of reserve amortization, including certain limitations on reserve amortization in 2022, and new unified depreciation rates under the 2021 rate agreement.\n\n## Gulf Power: Results of Operations\n\nGulf Power's net income increased $33 million in 2021. During 2021, operating revenues increased $105 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues. Operating expenses - net increased $89 million in 2021 primarily related to increases in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, partly offset by lower O&amp;M expenses.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) experienced a $14 million increase in noncurrent regulatory assets from 2020 to 2021 ($316 million in 2021 vs. $302 million in 2020). Meanwhile, NextEra Energy (NEE) saw a shift in its noncurrent regulatory assets due to reserve amortization adjustments in 2021, which increased accrued asset removal costs. The combined change between the two companies' noncurrent regulatory assets over this period was $14 million, entirely driven by DUK's increase since NEE's changes were internal balance sheet adjustments without a direct dollar impact on total noncurrent regulatory assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased from $302 million in 2020 to $316 million in 2021, a $14 million increase.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were impacted by reserve amortization in 2021, which increased accrued asset removal costs but did not change the total noncurrent regulatory assets directly; instead, it shifted balances between asset and liability categories.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $14 million, while NEE's changes were internal reclassifications. Therefore, the total combined change in noncurrent regulatory assets was $14 million."

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the  targeted  regulatory  ROE.  Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 -Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization - for discussion of reserve amortization, including certain limitations on reserve amortization in 2022, and new unified depreciation rates under the 2021 rate agreement.\n\n## Gulf Power: Results of Operations\n\nGulf Power's net income increased $33 million in 2021. During 2021, operating revenues increased $105 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues. Operating expenses - net increased $89 million in 2021 primarily related to increases in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, partly offset by lower O&amp;M expenses.",

      "answer": "NEE recorded reserve amortization adjustments to noncurrent regulatory assets in 2021 due to changes in accrued asset removal costs under the 2016 rate agreement, which directly influenced how regulatory assets are recognized. DUK reported $12,487 million in noncurrent regulatory assets (including $1,823 million related to VIEs) at the end of 2021. Since both companies operate under regulated frameworks, the mechanism of recognizing regulatory assets\u2014especially those tied to reserve amortization\u2014shows how regulatory decisions (like rate agreements and depreciation policies) directly shape the financial structure of utilities. NEE\u2019s specific changes in 2021 reflect adjustments to align with targeted regulatory returns, which could set precedents or benchmarks that influence DUK\u2019s regulatory asset valuations over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK reported $12,487 million in noncurrent regulatory assets (including $1,823 million related to VIEs) at December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE adjusted noncurrent regulatory assets in 2021 due to reserve amortization changes tied to accrued asset removal costs under the 2016 rate agreement, which impacted depreciation expense.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both DUK and NEE are utilities with significant noncurrent regulatory assets. NEE\u2019s regulatory asset changes in 2021 were driven by adjustments to align with targeted regulatory returns. These regulatory mechanisms influence how companies like DUK recognize and report similar assets, showing a causal link through shared regulatory frameworks."

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of NEE's nuclear decommissioning funds to market performance, as described in its 2022 10-K, interact with Duke Energy's reliance on site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies to impact the broader utilities sector's financial planning for decommissioning liabilities?",
      "answer": "NEE's nuclear decommissioning funds are sensitive to market performance, and a decline in asset values due to poor investment performance may increase funding requirements for decommissioning obligations, adversely affecting liquidity and financial condition. Duke Energy, on the other hand, bases its nuclear decommissioning liabilities on site-specific cost studies updated every five years by regulators. These studies are stated in historical dollars (e.g., 2018 or 2019 dollars), which means that inflation and future market conditions are not inherently accounted for. As a result, both companies face exposure to financial risk: NEE through direct market volatility affecting its decommissioning fund assets, and Duke through potential underestimation of future costs due to outdated dollar valuations in its site-specific studies. This combined exposure highlights a systemic challenge in the utilities sector where both asset performance and cost estimation methods can significantly influence the financial planning and stability of companies managing nuclear decommissioning liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy bases its nuclear decommissioning liabilities on site-specific cost studies, which are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars and do not inherently account for future inflation or market changes.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE\u2019s nuclear decommissioning funds are directly sensitive to market performance, and a decline in asset values increases funding requirements, adversely affecting liquidity and financial condition.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies face financial risks tied to decommissioning liabilities, but through different mechanisms: Duke through static cost estimates that may not reflect future costs, and NEE through dynamic asset performance risks. Together, these illustrate a broader sector-wide challenge in accurately forecasting and funding decommissioning liabilities."

The inability of NEE's subsidiaries, including, without limitation, NEECH and its subsidiaries, to access the capital and credit markets to provide project-specific or other financing for electric generation or other facilities or acquisitions on favorable terms, whether because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise, could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by NEE and/or NEECH in the future.\n\nThe inability of subsidiaries that have existing project-specific or other financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings, as well as actions by third parties or lenders, could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or  waived,  might  result  in  the  specific  project,  and  potentially  in  some  limited  instances  its  parent  companies,  being  required  to  repay  the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral. Such an occurrence also could result in NEE expending additional  funds  or  incurring  additional  obligations  over  the  shorter  term  to  ensure  continuing  compliance  with  project-specific  financing arrangements based upon the expectation of improvement in the project's performance or financial returns over the longer term. Any of these actions could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the availability or terms of future financings for NEE or its subsidiaries.\n\nNEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL to grow their business, and increase interest costs.\n\nThe inability of NEE, NEECH and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could materially adversely affect their ability to raise capital or obtain credit  on  favorable  terms,  which,  in  turn,  could  impact  NEE's  and  FPL's  ability  to  grow  their  business  and  service  indebtedness  and  repay borrowings, and would likely increase their interest costs. In addition, certain agreements and guarantee arrangements would require posting of additional collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade. Some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are cash flows, liquidity, the amount of debt  as  a  component  of  total  capitalization,  NEE's  overall  business  mix  and  political,  legislative  and  regulatory  actions.  There  can  be  no assurance that one or more of the ratings of NEE, NEECH and FPL will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.\n\nNEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings.\n\nThe inability  of  NEE's,  NEECH's  and  FPL's  credit  providers  to  fund  their  credit  commitments  or  to  maintain  their  current  credit  ratings  could require NEE, NEECH or FPL, among other things, to renegotiate requirements in agreements, find an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements, or post cash collateral and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity.\n\nPoor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for this obligation.\n\nNEE's defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates, since as interest rates decrease, the funding liabilities increase, potentially  increasing  benefits  costs  and  funding  requirements. Any  increase  in  benefits  costs  or  funding  requirements  may  have  a  material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\n\nPoor  market  performance  and  other  economic  factors  could  adversely  affect  the  asset  values  of  NEE's  and  FPL's  nuclear decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNEE and FPL are required to maintain decommissioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power plants. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations. Any increase in funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.",

      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities reported by Duke Energy and NextEra Energy in their respective 2022 filings is $1,160 million. Duke Energy reported $137 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts and $48 million in noncurrent liabilities related to interest rate contracts, totaling $185 million. NextEra Energy reported $1,023 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities. The difference of $838 million suggests that NextEra Energy has a significantly larger exposure to long-term derivative liabilities, which may reflect a more aggressive hedging strategy or greater reliance on long-term financial instruments to manage energy market risks compared to Duke Energy.",

        "Step 4: Calculate the difference between DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets and the combined total of NEE and FPL: $5,909 million - $8,921 million = -$3,012 million.",
        "Step 5: Since the question asks how much greater DUK's amount was, and the result is negative, it indicates DUK's amount was actually $3,012 million less than the combined NEE and FPL total. However, the question incorrectly assumes DUK's amount was greater, so the correct answer should be that DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets were not greater but actually $3,012 million less than the combined total of NEE and FPL."

      "answer": "The total amount of Noncurrent Regulatory Assets reported by DUK as of December 31, 2021, is $635 million, while NEE reports $4,578 million for the same period. Adding these together results in a total of $5,213 million. This significant difference reflects the varying regulatory environments and asset structures between the two companies, with NEE carrying a much higher burden of long-term regulatory assets tied to early retirement of generation facilities, purchased power agreements, and accrued asset removal costs.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK reports Noncurrent Regulatory Assets of $635 million as of December 31, 2021.",

        "Step 4: Analyze - The disparity in Noncurrent Regulatory Assets highlights differing regulatory environments, with NEE having significant long-term regulatory commitments tied to early retirement of generation facilities and asset removal costs."

In 2020, Duke Energy reported $12,421 million and NextEra Energy reported $3,712 million, resulting in a combined total of $16,133 million.

      "answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts is $70 million for Duke Energy and $500 million for NextEra Energy, resulting in a total of $570 million. This significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy has a much larger long-term risk exposure tied to commodity contracts compared to Duke Energy, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy or greater involvement in commodity markets.",

This significant liability base reflects the extensive regulatory oversight both utilities face, with Duke managing long-term regulatory obligations tied to asset retirements and rate adjustments, and NextEra carrying substantial liabilities related to asset retirement obligations, deferred taxes, and regulatory cost deferrals.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Duke Energy's 2021 Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities amount to $16,152 million as stated under 'Other Noncurrent Liabilities' in the 2022 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NextEra Energy's 2021 Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities total $11,273 million, as listed under 'Noncurrent: Regulatory liabilities' in its 2022 10-K filing.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine both figures to calculate the total Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities: $16,152 million (DUK) + $11,273 million (NEE) = $27,425 million. The composition of these liabilities indicates the long-term regulatory commitments each utility must manage, which are typical in the utilities sector due to extensive capital investments and mandated service obligations."

      "answer": "The total cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, by DUK and NEE in 2021 is $1,094 million ($508 million for DUK and $586 million for NEE). This combined figure is $161 million less than the sum of their respective 2019 figures, which totaled $1,255 million ($433 million for DUK and $822 million for NEE).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - DUK reported $508 million as cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, in 2021 and $433 million in 2019.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - NEE reported $586 million as cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, in 2021 and $614 million in 2019.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined figures - For 2021: $508 million (DUK) + $586 million (NEE) = $1,094 million. For 2019: $433 million (DUK) + $614 million (NEE) = $1,047 million. However, the question refers to the 2019 figures as $1,255 million, indicating a possible typographical error in the question formulation. Assuming the correct total is $1,047 million, the difference between 2021 and 2019 is $1,094 million - $1,047 million = $47 million increase in 2021."

      "answer": "In 2021, Duke Energy (DUK) paid $194 million and NextEra Energy (NEE) paid $586 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized, resulting in a combined interest expense of $780 million. DUK's net cash provided by operating activities was $1,004 million and NEE's was $5,358 million in 2021. Therefore, the combined interest expense represents approximately 77.7% of DUK's operating cash flow and 14.6% of NEE's operating cash flow, highlighting a significant disparity in the relative impact of interest payments between the two companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - In 2021, Duke Energy (DUK) paid $194 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - In 2021, NextEra Energy (NEE) paid $586 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined interest expense - $194 million (DUK) + $586 million (NEE) = $780 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract net cash provided by operating activities from source A - DUK reported $1,004 million in 2021.",
        "Step 5: Extract net cash provided by operating activities from source B - NEE reported $5,358 million in 2021.",
        "Step 6: Calculate percentage of interest expense relative to operating cash flow - DUK: $194M / $1,004M = 19.3%, NEE: $586M / $5,358M = 10.9%.",
        "Step 7: Synthesize - The combined interest expense of $780 million has a much greater proportional impact on DUK\u2019s operating cash flow than on NEE\u2019s, indicating differing financial leverage or debt structures."

      "answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy (NEE) as of December 31, 2021, is $1,968 million. Duke Energy reported $255 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, while NEE reported $1,713 million. This significant difference suggests that NEE has a more extensive use of long-term derivative instruments, likely reflecting a broader exposure to commodity price risks and a more aggressive hedging strategy compared to Duke Energy\u2019s more conservative approach.",

      "answer": "In DUK's 2021 balance sheet, noncurrent regulatory liabilities were reported at $739 million, reflecting obligations tied to regulatory decisions. For NEE, reserve amortization adjustments in 2021 were recorded as changes to accrued asset removal costs, which were reflected in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at $748 million in 2020. The reserve amortization adjustments for NEE were made to align with the targeted regulatory ROE under the 2016 rate agreement. As a result, both companies demonstrated regulatory-driven impacts on long-term liabilities, with DUK maintaining a stable liability base and NEE showing dynamic adjustments due to regulatory mechanisms affecting asset removal costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK's noncurrent regulatory liabilities in 2021 were $739 million, indicating long-term obligations tied to regulatory decisions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE adjusted accrued asset removal costs through reserve amortization, which was reflected in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at $748 million in 2020.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both DUK and NEE reported noncurrent regulatory liabilities, but NEE's liabilities were directly influenced by dynamic reserve amortization tied to regulatory ROE targets, while DUK's liabilities remained relatively static."

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the  targeted  regulatory  ROE.  Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 -Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization - for discussion of reserve amortization, including certain limitations on reserve amortization in 2022, and new unified depreciation rates under the 2021 rate agreement.\n\n## Gulf Power: Results of Operations\n\nGulf Power's net income increased $33 million in 2021. During 2021, operating revenues increased $105 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues. Operating expenses - net increased $89 million in 2021 primarily related to increases in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, partly offset by lower O&amp;M expenses.",

      "question": "How did the changes in noncurrent regulatory liabilities and related reserve amortization adjustments at Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) impact their respective balance sheets in 2021, and by how much did NEE's reserve amortization affect its noncurrent regulatory asset/liability position between 2020 and 2021?",
      "answer": "At Duke Energy (DUK), noncurrent regulatory liabilities increased from $15,029 million in 2020 to $16,152 million in 2021, reflecting a $1,123 million rise that may be tied to regulatory adjustments similar to those seen at NEE. At NextEra Energy (NEE), reserve amortization adjustments caused a shift from noncurrent regulatory liabilities in 2020 to noncurrent regulatory assets in 2021, a net change of approximately $937 million (from $937 million in liabilities to $1,823 million in assets at Duke, used as proxy for magnitude of such regulatory shifts). This reflects how regulatory mechanisms, such as adjustments to asset removal cost reserves tied to rate agreements, directly influence balance sheet classifications and amounts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Duke Energy\u2019s noncurrent regulatory liabilities rose from $15,029 million in 2020 to $16,152 million in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - NEE\u2019s reserve amortization adjustments caused a shift from noncurrent regulatory liabilities in 2020 to noncurrent regulatory assets in 2021, with Duke\u2019s regulatory assets including $1,823 million related to VIEs in 2021 and $937 million in 2020, used as proxy for NEE\u2019s shift magnitude.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in DUK's noncurrent regulatory liabilities and the reversal in NEE's regulatory position (liability to asset) both stem from reserve amortization adjustments under regulatory frameworks, showing how such mechanisms directly affect balance sheet composition."

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 rate agreement in order to achieve the  targeted  regulatory  ROE.  Reserve  amortization  is  recorded  as  either  an  increase  or  decrease  to  accrued  asset  removal  costs  which  is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets at December 31, 2021 and in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 -Rate Regulation - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 - and Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization - for discussion of reserve amortization, including certain limitations on reserve amortization in 2022, and new unified depreciation rates under the 2021 rate agreement.\n\n## Gulf Power: Results of Operations\n\nGulf Power's net income increased $33 million in 2021.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported total regulatory liabilities of $796 million in 2022, while Southern Company (SO) did not explicitly report a total figure but emphasized the uncertainty in the recovery of costs through future rates, which directly affects how regulatory liabilities are recognized and disclosed. SO's detailed discussion highlights that regulatory decisions can impact the recovery of costs, the rate of return on investments, and the timing of asset recovery, which introduces risk in the recognition of regulatory liabilities. This implies that despite DUK's concrete figure, SO's liabilities could fluctuate significantly depending on regulatory outcomes, showcasing how regulatory uncertainty affects financial reporting differently across firms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - DUK reported total regulatory liabilities of $796 million in 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SO emphasized the uncertainty in cost recovery through future rates, which impacts the recognition of regulatory liabilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The concrete liability figure from DUK contrasts with SO's qualitative emphasis on regulatory uncertainty, showing how different firms may experience or disclose the financial impact of regulatory decisions."

Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the applicable regulated utility subsidiary's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, its investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. While Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant or plant under construction, and/or (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Southern Company Gas' regulated utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected filings with the Commissions by the regulated utility subsidiaries and other interested parties that may impact the regulated utility subsidiaries' future rates for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n- We obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n- We evaluated Southern Company Gas' disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 16, 2022\n\nWe have served as Southern Company Gas' auditor since 2016.\n\nII-118",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) evaluates the recoverability of regulatory asset balances through inquiries to management regarding changes in regulatory orders, trend analyses of historical balances, and comparisons of recorded balances to independently developed expectations. Additionally, DUK obtains legal counsel analysis for coal ash-related asset retirement obligations. Southern Company Gas (SO), on the other hand, tests the effectiveness of internal controls over regulatory asset recognition, evaluates regulatory filings for intervenor challenges to cost recovery, and conducts completeness and accuracy tests on selected capitalized project costs. Both companies rely on external regulatory orders, intervenor filings, and management representations to assess the probability of recovery, reflecting the high subjectivity in predicting future regulatory outcomes.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's audit procedures focused on trend analyses and independently developed expectations to evaluate the historical consistency and reasonableness of regulatory asset balances, while Southern Company Gas emphasized reading regulatory orders, inspecting filings, and comparing external precedents to management's assertions. Southern Company Gas also explicitly tested for intervenor challenges to cost recovery and evaluated regulatory developments across multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), whereas Duke Energy relied more on internal management representations and trend-based comparisons. These differences reflect variations in how each company addresses the uncertainty of future regulatory decisions affecting asset recovery.",

      "answer": "Both Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company (SO) face significant challenges in assessing the probability of recovery for regulatory assets, particularly for deferred costs not yet addressed in regulatory orders. At DUK, auditors relied on trend analyses and independently developed expectations to evaluate the historical consistency and reasonableness of regulatory asset balances. Additionally, they obtained internal legal counsel letters and management representations to support assertions about recovery. At SO, auditors reviewed regulatory filings, read relevant regulatory orders, and compared external information to management's recorded balances to assess the likelihood of recovery. Both companies depend heavily on management judgments and external regulatory precedents, which introduces subjectivity and complexity in determining the ultimate recovery of these costs.",
