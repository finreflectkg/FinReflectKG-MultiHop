VZ's service revenue growth in 2024 was primarily driven by increases in wireless service revenue, despite challenges like 3G network shutdowns and customer profile changes.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions\n\n## Employer Contributions\n\nWe operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During 2024, we made discretionary contributions in the aggregate amount of $365 million to our qualified pension plans. During 2023, we made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified pension plans. During 2024 and 2023, we made contributions of $56 million and $52 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively.\n\nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability  hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity  of the liability . W e ex pect that the strategy  will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will generally result in lower expected asset returns. For 2025, we expect no required qualified pension plan contributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions.\n\nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $935 million and $936 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $726 million in 2025.\n\n## Leasing Arrangements\n\nSee Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWe guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, V erizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing  arrangements  and  payment  obligations  to  third  parties,  were  outstanding.  See  Note  16  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional information.\n\n## Other Future Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, V erizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements with third parties for a total of approximately 3.7 gigawatts of anticipated renewable energy capacity across multiple states. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nA summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows:\n\n## Wireless Licenses and G oodwill\n\nWireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier  assessment  or  changes  in  circumstances  during  an  interim  period  suggesting  impairment  indicators  are  present.  W e  believe  our  estimates  and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. A lthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates.  Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.",

      "question": "What is the combined amount of long-term debt maturing within one year for both AT&T and Verizon in 2024, and how does this affect their short-term liquidity strategies?",
      "answer": "The combined amount of long-term debt maturing within one year for AT&T and Verizon in 2024 is $27,657 million. AT&T has $5,089 million in such debt, while Verizon has $22,568 million. This significant short-term debt burden implies both companies must prioritize liquidity management in 2025, with AT&T planning to fund its obligations through cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales, and Verizon likely needing to maintain access to credit facilities and manage its cash flow efficiently to meet its larger maturing obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AT&T's long-term debt maturing within one year is $5,089 million as stated in the 2024 10-K filing.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon's long-term debt maturing within one year is $22,568 million as shown in the debt maturity table of its 2024 10-K filing.",
        "Step 3: Add the two figures together - $5,089 million (AT&T) + $22,568 million (Verizon) = $27,657 million in total short-term debt maturities for both companies.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the implications - Both companies must manage their short-term liquidity carefully, with AT&T explicitly stating plans to use cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales to meet obligations, while Verizon's larger amount suggests a similar emphasis on maintaining liquidity."

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Dollars in millions ex cept per share amounts\n\nThe weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had $122,116 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $30,685.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $5,089 of long-term debt maturing within one year. We had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings or other short-term borrowings on December 31, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring 2024, we paid $1,792 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were $1,448, with $749 due within one year (in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in 'Other noncurrent liabilities').\n\nIn December 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $10,000 share repurchase authorization and terminated the March 2014 authorization, under which approximately 144 million shares were available for repurchase. At December 31, 2024, we had $10,000 remaining from our common stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in December 2024.\n\nWe paid dividends on common and preferred shares of $8,208 in 2024, compared with $8,136 in 2023. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $1.11 per share in 2024 and in 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&amp;T and long-term growth opportunities.\n\nOur 2025 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and repurchasing common stock when deemed appropriate. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have a $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2029 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWe also utilize other ex ternal financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\n\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-toEBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&amp;T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\n\n## Collateral Arrangements\n\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&amp;T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our $34,884 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2024, we received $477 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)\n\n## Other\n\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders' equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2024, our debt ratio was 50.7%, compared to 53.5% at December 31, 2023 and 56.1% at December 31, 2022. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.",

      "answer": "The 1.1% decline in prepaid subscribers reported by Company T directly contributed to the $169 million decrease in access costs for Company VZ in 2024. This causal relationship arises because a reduction in prepaid subscribers leads to lower usage and fewer access points needed, which in turn reduces the associated access costs for network providers like VZ.

Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\n\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-year to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nWireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed period of time (generally ten years), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in 'Acquisitions, net of cash acquired' in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.\n\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of 25 years.\n\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&amp;T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these ex clusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\n\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow approach on a presumed royalty rate derived from the revenues related to each brand name.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note 9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized using primarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Finitelived trademarks and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method. These assets, along with other long-lived assets, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nAdvertising Costs We expense advertising costs for products and services or for promoting our corporate image as incurred (see Note 23).\n\nForeign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies. We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at ex change rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and ex penses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 14 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.",

Depreciation expense included amortization of software totaling $3,076 in 2024, $3,023 in 2023 and $2,972 in 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $1,413 to abandon conduits that will not be utilized to support future network activity. The abandonment was considered outside the ordinary course of business.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we updated our analysis of economic lives of AT&amp;T-owned fiber network assets. As of January 1, 2022, we extended the estimated economic life and depreciation period of such costs to better reflect the physical life of the assets that we had been ex periencing and absence of technological changes that would replace fiber as the best broadband technology in the industry. The change in accounting estimate decreased depreciation expense $280, or $0.03 per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## NOTE 8. LEASES\n\nWe have operating and finance leases for certain facilities and equipment used in our operations. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 15 years. Some of our operating leases (e.g., for towers and real estate) contain renewal options that may be exercised, and some of our leases include options to terminate the leases within one year.\n\nWe have recognized a right-of-use asset for both operating and finance leases, and a corresponding lease liability that represents the present value of our obligation to make payments over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate in the currency of the lease, which will be updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities.\n\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\n\n",

M anagement uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn those circumstances where V erizon is the lessee, we account for non-lease components associated with our leases (e.g., common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes. A dditionally , in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.\n\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income, based on the use of the facility or equipment on which rent is being paid. V ariable rent payments related to both operating and finance leases are expensed in the period incurred. Our variable lease payments consist of payments dependent on various external indicators, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage.\n\nOperating leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets; we recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe recognize the amortization of the right-of-use asset for our finance leases on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use  asset  in  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.

The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable pricing inputs in the market\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate.",

The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\n\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-year to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nWireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed period of time (generally ten years), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in 'Acquisitions, net of cash acquired' in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.\n\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of 25 years.\n\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&amp;T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these ex clusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\n\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow approach on a presumed royalty rate derived from the revenues related to each brand name.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note 9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized using primarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Finitelived trademarks and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method. These assets, along with other long-lived assets, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nAdvertising Costs We expense advertising costs for products and services or for promoting our corporate image as incurred (see Note 23).\n\nForeign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies. We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at ex change rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and ex penses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 14 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.",

      "answer": "AT&T served 19 million prepaid subscribers in 2024, which contributed to their broader customer base and network utilization. Meanwhile, Verizon experienced a decrease in prepaid subscribers, which directly led to a $169 million reduction in access costs for the company during 2024. This shows that the broader trend of shifting prepaid subscriber dynamics had a measurable impact on cost structures for both companies, with Verizon benefiting from lower access costs due to fewer prepaid users.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AT&T served 19 million prepaid subscribers as of December 31, 2024, indicating a significant portion of their Mobility business involves prepaid services.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Verizon reported a $169 million decrease in access costs primarily as a result of decreases in prepaid subscribers, changes in usage, and net circuit access prices.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The decline in Verizon's access costs is causally linked to fewer prepaid subscribers, while AT&T continues to serve a large prepaid subscriber base. This contrast highlights how the same industry trend (prepaid subscriber dynamics) affects companies differently, with Verizon experiencing cost relief and AT&T leveraging prepaid services for subscriber growth."

In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology.\n\nBroadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to ex pand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\n\nCopper Decommissioning While building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our ex it strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\n\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading 'Segment Results' in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Business, Cricket, AT&amp;T PREPAID , AT&amp;T Fiber and AT&amp;T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. SM\n\nMobility Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. \u00ae\n\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, tex t and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\n\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&amp;T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.",

      "question": "What is the combined value of Wireless Licenses held by both T and VZ in 2024, and how does the difference in their amortization practices reflect on the potential long-term value retention of these licenses?",
      "answer": "The combined value of Wireless Licenses for T and VZ in 2024 is $159,612 million ($2,999 million for T and $156,613 million for VZ). T amortizes its wireless licenses over a weighted-average life of 21.6 years, having accumulated $696 million in amortization by 2024, which suggests a more conservative approach to asset value retention. In contrast, VZ reports its wireless licenses at nearly full value with no accumulated amortization disclosed, indicating a potentially indefinite life or a different accounting policy, which may signal stronger long-term value retention for its licenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - T reports wireless licenses at $2,999 million in 2024 with accumulated amortization of $696 million over a weighted-average life of 21.6 years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - VZ reports wireless licenses at $156,613 million in 2024 with no accumulated amortization disclosed.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined value - $2,999 million (T) + $156,613 million (VZ) = $159,612 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The difference in amortization practices implies divergent assumptions about the long-term value and useful life of wireless licenses between the two companies."

      "answer": "AT&T (T) does not amortize its FCC wireless licenses and instead tests them annually for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach on an aggregate basis. However, AT&T does amortize its wireless licenses in Mexico over a 25-year average economic life. In contrast, Verizon (VZ) treats its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived intangible assets and also does not amortize them, testing them annually for impairment. The difference in amortization policy means that AT&T recognizes periodic depreciation expense for its Mexican licenses, which affects earnings, while Verizon does not record any amortization expense for its licenses. This results in differing financial impacts on asset valuation and income statements, with AT&T experiencing a gradual reduction in asset value over time for Mexican licenses, while Verizon\u2019s wireless license values remain on the balance sheet unless impaired.",

The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\n\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-year to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nWireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed period of time (generally ten years), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in 'Acquisitions, net of cash acquired' in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.\n\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of 25 years.\n\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&amp;T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these ex clusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\n\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow approach on a presumed royalty rate derived from the revenues related to each brand name.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note 9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized using primarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Finitelived trademarks and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method. These assets, along with other long-lived assets, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nAdvertising Costs We expense advertising costs for products and services or for promoting our corporate image as incurred (see Note 23).\n\nForeign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies. We translate their foreign assets and liabilities at ex change rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. We translate their revenues and ex penses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated OCI on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 3).\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits See Note 14 for a comprehensive discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, including a discussion of the actuarial assumptions, our policy for recognizing the associated gains and losses and our method used to estimate service and interest cost components.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions\n\n## Employer Contributions\n\nWe operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units. During 2024, we made discretionary contributions in the aggregate amount of $365 million to our qualified pension plans. During 2023, we made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to one of our qualified pension plans. During 2024 and 2023, we made contributions of $56 million and $52 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively.\n\nOur overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability  hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity  of the liability . W e ex pect that the strategy  will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries. Over time, as the asset allocation shifts to more liability hedging assets, this strategy will generally result in lower expected asset returns. For 2025, we expect no required qualified pension plan contributions and insignificant nonqualified pension plan contributions.\n\nContributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $935 million and $936 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $726 million in 2025.\n\n## Leasing Arrangements\n\nSee Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWe guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sale of businesses and investments, V erizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing  arrangements  and  payment  obligations  to  third  parties,  were  outstanding.  See  Note  16  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional information.\n\n## Other Future Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, V erizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements with third parties for a total of approximately 3.7 gigawatts of anticipated renewable energy capacity across multiple states. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nA summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows:\n\n## Wireless Licenses and G oodwill\n\nWireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier  assessment  or  changes  in  circumstances  during  an  interim  period  suggesting  impairment  indicators  are  present.  W e  believe  our  estimates  and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. A lthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates.  Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.",

      "answer": "T reported a negative Total Broadband and DSL Net Addition of (189,000) in 2024, indicating a net loss in broadband customers. In contrast, VZ defines Total Broadband connections to include Fios, DSL, and FWA, and actively tracks net additions by adding new connections and subtracting disconnects. Given that VZ provides a detailed framework for how broadband connections are calculated and maintained, the negative figure from T suggests a different market dynamic or strategic focus. This contrast implies that while VZ may be experiencing growth or stability in its broadband segment, T is facing contraction, potentially due to different competitive pressures, customer retention strategies, or investment levels in infrastructure.",

      "answer": "NFLX determines the fair value of its noncurrent assets using observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable, as stated in their 10-K filing. In contrast, T uses quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets to determine the fair value of its notes and debentures. This difference in valuation methods reflects how each company approaches the fair value measurement of noncurrent assets, with NFLX focusing on similar assets and T relying on quoted prices in varying market conditions.",

      "answer": "NFLX disclosed that its Allowance for Credit Losses was not material as of December 31, 2023, indicating minimal risk in collecting receivables, likely due to its subscription-based model with recurring revenue and low credit risk from individual members. In contrast, T reported an ending balance of $756 million in its Allowance for Credit Losses for 2023, showing a significant provision for potential credit losses. This difference reveals that T faces higher credit risk, possibly due to business-to-business receivables with longer payment terms or higher exposure to economically sensitive customers. NFLX\u2019s minimal allowance suggests a more stable and predictable cash flow, while T\u2019s larger allowance reflects a more cautious financial strategy in managing credit exposure.",

AT&T also uses quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets to determine the fair value of notes and debentures, which are classified under Level 2.

This combined financial obligation indicates that Netflix bears a significantly larger interest burden, suggesting a more aggressive debt-financed strategy, particularly for content investment, compared to AT&T\u2019s smaller interest payment, which may reflect a more conservative or mature capital structure.",

Netflix\u2019s operating margin is 21%, while AT&T\u2019s is approximately 19.2% (calculated from operating income of $23,461 million and total revenues of $122,428 million), indicating that Netflix is more operationally efficient in converting revenue into operating income.",

      "answer": "For T in 2022, the basic earnings per share calculation was adjusted upward by $663 due to a noncontrolling interest adjustment, which directly impacts the income attributable to common stock. Additionally, dilutive potential common shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share because the net loss made them antidilutive. In contrast, NFLX reported a net income of $4,491,924 thousand in 2022 with 444,698 thousand weighted-average shares outstanding, resulting in a basic earnings per share of $10.10 and a diluted earnings per share of $9.95. The difference in treatment\u2014T excluding dilutive shares due to a net loss while NFLX included them\u2014highlights how entity-specific adjustments and capital structure decisions influence earnings per share outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NFLX reported net income of $4,491,924 thousand and weighted-average shares of 444,698 thousand in 2022, leading to a basic EPS of $10.10 and diluted EPS of $9.95.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - T increased income attributable to common stock by $663 in 2022 due to a noncontrolling interest adjustment, and excluded dilutive shares from diluted EPS because of a net loss, making those shares antidilutive.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The two companies show contrasting treatments of EPS: NFLX had positive net income and included dilutive shares, while T adjusted income upward but excluded dilutive shares due to a net loss, revealing how financial performance and entity-specific adjustments lead to different EPS outcomes."

      "answer": "NFLX stated that accrued participations and residuals were not material as of December 31, 2021, indicating the amount had a negligible impact on its financial position. In contrast, T reported accrued participations and residuals of $2,966 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a significant portion of its total accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($50,661 million). This shows that while NFLX considered the liability immaterial, T had a quantifiably substantial obligation in this category, suggesting differing scales or structures of content-related liabilities between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

adverse changes in mortality assumptions; adverse medical cost trends; and unfavorable or delayed implementation or repeal of healthcare legislation, regulations or related court decisions.\n- The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings (including judicial review, if any, of such proceedings) and legislative efforts involving issues that are important to our business, including, without limitation, pending Notices of Apparent Liability; the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, including the withdrawal of legacy TDM-based services; universal service; broadband deployment; wireless equipment siting regulations and, in particular, siting for 5G service; E911 services; competition policy; privacy; net neutrality; multichannel video programming distributor services and equipment; content licensing and copyright protection; availability of new spectrum on fair and balanced terms; and wireless and satellite license awards and renewals.\n- Enactment of additional state, local, federal and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations, or changes to existing standards and actions by tax agencies and judicial authorities including the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions, pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments, including laws and regulations that reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs.\n- Potential changes to the electromagnetic spectrum currently used for broadcast television and satellite distribution being considered by the FCC could negatively impact WarnerMedia's ability to deliver linear network feeds of its domestic cable networks to its affiliates, and in some cases, WarnerMedia's ability to produce high-value news and entertainment programming on location.\n- U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding intellectual property rights protection and privacy, personal data protection and user consent are complex and rapidly evolving and could result in adverse impacts to our business plans, increased costs, or claims against us that may harm our reputation.\n- The ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us, including non-regulation of comparable alternative technologies and/or government-owned or subsidized networks.\n- Disruption in our supply chain for a number of reasons, including, difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, workforce shortage, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability and public health emergencies.\n- The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable wireless, video content and broadband offerings and devices, and, in particular, the success of our HBO Max platform; the extent to which regulatory and build-out requirements apply to our offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings.\n- Our ability to generate subscription and advertising revenue from attractive video content, especially from WarnerMedia, in the face of unpredictable and rapidly evolving public viewing habits and legal restrictions on using personal data for advertising.\n- The availability and cost and our ability to adequately fund additional wireless spectrum and network upgrades; and regulations and conditions relating to spectrum use, licensing, obtaining additional spectrum, technical standards and deployment and usage, including network management rules.\n- Our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms.\n- The outcome of pending, threatened or potential litigation (which includes arbitrations), including, without limitation, patent and product safety claims by or against third parties or claims based on alleged misconduct by employees.",

For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

      "answer": "NFLX's substantial debt obligations, including $15.5 billion in senior notes and $7.4 billion in content liabilities as of December 31, 2021, increase its financial leverage and borrowing needs. This contributes to broader market pressures on credit availability and interest rates, which negatively affect companies like T that are also reliant on debt financing. T faces risks from adverse changes in financial markets and potential credit rating downgrades, which could increase its cost of borrowing and impose more restrictive financing conditions. As a result, NFLX's high debt levels indirectly exacerbate T's financing challenges by tightening overall credit market conditions and increasing borrowing costs across the sector.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NFLX had $15.5 billion in senior notes and $7.4 billion in content liabilities as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - T's cost of borrowing is affected by credit market conditions and potential credit rating downgrades, which could increase its borrowing costs and restrict access to capital.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - NFLX's high debt obligations contribute to sector-wide credit market tightness, which in turn negatively impacts T\u2019s ability to borrow at favorable rates."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nadversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equitylinked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\n## We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2021, we had the equivalent of $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding ('Notes'), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n- make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n- limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- increase our cost of borrowing;\n- limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n- require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n- limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n- increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.",

          "chunk_text": "The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR in 2023. Although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for LIBOR-based securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general. A company's cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects. While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed, adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions, severely affecting our business operations. Additionally, downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which could negatively impact our liquidity. Further, valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity.\n\n## Our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability, to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities.\n\nWe have international operations, including in Mexico, and worldwide through WarnerMedia's content distribution. We need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws, regulations and treaties. We are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation, foreign exchange controls, fluctuations in currency values, changes in relationships between U.S. and foreign governments, trade restrictions including potential tariffs, differences in intellectual property protection laws, and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings. Our Mexico operations, in particular, rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition. While our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services, a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns, increased inflation, currency devaluation, foreign exchange controls, instability in the banking sector and high unemployment. Should these conditions persist, our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided.\n\nIn addition, operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses, either to comply with local laws or, for example, to enhance product marketing, deploy networks or execute on other capital projects. Involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## Industry-wide Factors:\n\n## Our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused, and may continue to cause, a negative effect on our operating results. At the onset in 2020, mitigation measures caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations, which adversely affected our advertising revenues and, resulted in contract disputes concerning carriage rights that caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation. The closure or avoidance of theaters, and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID-19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our WarnerMedia business over the long term. The COVID-19 pandemic also drove higher costs for our WarnerMedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production. If the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged, we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services, having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit. Further, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic could again result in the closure of many of our retail stores, temporarily or permanently, and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides. These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers' ability to pay for our products and services. We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations, resulting in delays in service. Further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services, adversely impacting our competitive position. We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends; extended cancellation periods; and increased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.",

      "question": "How did the impact of stock-based compensation and international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on NFLX's effective tax rate compare to the impact of state and local income taxes on T's effective tax rate in 2021?",
      "answer": "NFLX's effective tax rate for 2021 was 12%, significantly below the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In contrast, T's effective tax rate for 2021 was 20.3%, with state and local income taxes contributing $967 million to the tax expense, which was partially offset by federal income tax benefits. The two companies experienced different effective tax rates due to distinct factors: NFLX benefited from stock-based compensation tax advantages, while T faced higher state and local tax burdens.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, NFLX had a 12% effective tax rate in 2021, significantly lower than the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, T had a 20.3% effective tax rate in 2021, with $967 million in state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit) increasing the overall tax expense.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The causal mechanism is that NFLX's effective tax rate was more significantly reduced by federal-level benefits (stock-based compensation and international tax provisions), while T's effective tax rate was pulled upward by state-level tax liabilities despite federal benefits."

The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

      "answer": "Netflix experienced a decrease in net cash from financing activities by $2,387 million due to the absence of debt issuances and the repurchase of $600 million in stock, which weakened its cash flow position. In contrast, AT&T generated $19.032 billion from debt issuances during 2021, significantly boosting its cash inflows from financing activities. This divergence in debt strategy suggests that AT&T was actively leveraging its balance sheet to fund operations or investments, while Netflix was reducing its financial flexibility through deleveraging and equity repurchases.",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

AT&T indicated it would fund share repurchases through a combination of cash from operations, borrowings, and asset sales, but did not specify an exact amount for 2021.

Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2021, $4.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n",

To implement this authorization, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. We will continue to fund any share repurchases through a combination of cash from operations, borrowings dependent on market conditions, or cash from the disposition of certain non-strategic investments.\n\nExcluding the impact of acquisitions, our 2022 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\n\nA summary of our repurchases of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2021 is as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "NFLX listed 'Financial Statement Schedules' as part of Item 15 in its 2022 10-K filing, indicating that it submitted such schedules. T, on the other hand, omitted certain financial statement schedules, stating that the required information was contained in the financial statements and notes or that the schedules were not required or applicable. Therefore, while NFLX included its financial statement schedules, T did not file additional schedules beyond what was necessary, leading to a difference in the number of schedules filed.",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nOur segments are comprised of strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our segments based on segment operating contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items (as discussed below), and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each segment. We have three reportable segments: (1) Communications, (2) WarnerMedia and (3) Latin America.\n\nWe also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as operating contribution excluding equity in net income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating contribution nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues.\n\nThe Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally.

      "answer": "Netflix experienced a $2,387 million decrease in net cash from financing activities in 2021 due to the absence of debt issuances compared to the prior year, $600 million in stock repurchases, and the repayment of $500 million in senior notes. In contrast, AT&T paid $4,596 million under its vendor financing program in 2021, which was significantly higher than the $2,966 million paid in 2020, indicating a strategic use of vendor financing to manage cash flow. This contrast shows that Netflix focused on reducing financing inflows through debt and equity actions, while AT&T leaned more heavily on vendor financing as part of its cash management strategy.",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

The full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees' ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Such production pauses have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions can result in additional costs to production, including additional pay to cast and crew. Also, Covid-related delays and production protocols and requirements, including use of PPE and testing, add to costs of production.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers' ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors' ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we have expanded our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which risks have been heightened during Covid-19. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions.

These suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products. In certain limited circumstances, suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion. In such limited circumstances, we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers. It is possible that, in some circumstances, we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results.\n\n## Increasing costs to provide services and failure to renew agreements on favorable terms or at all, could adversely affect operating margins.\n\nOur operating costs, including customer acquisition and retention costs, could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels.\n\nA number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less (or no) regulation, and therefore are able to operate with lower costs. These competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service. Also, these competitors have cost advantages compared to us, due in part to operating on newer, more technically advanced and lower-cost networks with a nonunionized workforce, lower employee benefits and fewer retirees. We are transitioning services from our old copper-based network and seeking regulatory approvals, where needed, at both the state and federal levels. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions, we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages.\n\nOur WarnerMedia operations, which create and license content to other providers, may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms, including those related to pricing, positioning and packaging, during contract negotiations, which may lead to blackouts of WarnerMedia programming, and WarnerMedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties.\n\n## We may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have  a  materially  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  operations,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  competitive position.\n\nWe have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to reduce costs, streamline and modernize distribution and customer service, remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions. Our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience. We intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus, which consist of improving broadband connectivity (for example, fiber and 5G), developing software-based entertainment (such as HBO Max) and utilizing WarnerMedia's storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points. We also expect these initiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins. If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized, and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected.",

      "answer": "At NFLX, the increase in production activity led to a $187 million rise in personnel-related costs and a $66 million increase in third-party expenses, which directly increased general and administrative expenses. This rise in costs likely places downward pressure on NFLX's operating margin. Meanwhile, at T, supply chain disruptions and increasing service provision costs, including supplier delays and higher component prices, are cited as factors that could negatively impact operating margins. Together, these cost increases at both companies demonstrate how production and supply chain cost pressures can reduce profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

      "answer": "Netflix's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021, and the company evaluates the need for an allowance based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. In contrast, AT&T records an allowance for credit losses by considering the probability of recoverability of accounts receivable based on past experience, current collection trends, and general economic factors, including bankruptcy rates. AT&T also incorporates future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset, with allowances generally increasing as receivables age. This indicates that while both companies consider historical and economic factors, AT&T employs a more structured and forward-looking lifetime loss estimation approach, whereas Netflix\u2019s credit risk exposure appears minimal and likely less formally segmented by aging or future projections.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Netflix's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021, and is based on historical collection trends, payment partner financial condition, and external market factors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as 'Content assets, net' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company's partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",

          "chunk_text": "The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of an operating lease liability of $22,121 and an operating right-of-use asset of the same amount. Existing prepaid and deferred rent accruals were recorded as an offset to the right-of-use asset, resulting in a net asset of $20,960. The cumulative effect of the adoption to retained earnings was an increase of $316 reflecting the reclassification of deferred gains related to sale/leaseback transactions. The standard did not materially impact our income statements or statements of cash flows, and had no impact on our covenant compliance under our current debt agreements.\n\nIncome Taxes We record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the computed tax basis of those assets and liabilities. We record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets (included, together with our deferred income tax assets, as part of our reportable net deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets), for which the realization is uncertain. We review these items regularly in light of changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in our business.\n\nAs of January 1, 2021, we adopted, with modified retrospective application, the FASB's ASU No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' (ASU 2019-12), which is expected to simplify income tax accounting requirements in areas deemed costly and complex. ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents  include  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of  three months or less. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. At December 31, 2021, we held $5,204 in cash and $15,965 in money market funds and other cash equivalents. Of our total cash and cash equivalents, $2,706 resided in foreign jurisdictions, some of which is subject to restrictions on repatriation.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses We record expense to maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses that result from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments deemed collectible from the customer when the service was provided or product was delivered. When determining the allowances for trade receivables and loans, we consider the probability of recoverability of accounts receivable based on past experience, taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors, including bankruptcy rates. We also consider future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Credit risks are assessed based on historical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with allowances generally increasing as the receivable ages. Accounts receivable may be fully reserved for when specific collection issues are known to exist, such as catastrophes or pending bankruptcies.\n\nInventories Inventories primarily consist of wireless devices and accessories and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\nLicensed Programming Inventory Cost Recognition and Impairment We enter into agreements to license programming exhibition rights from licensors. A programming inventory asset related to these rights and a corresponding liability payable to the licensor are recorded (on a discounted basis if the license agreements are long-term) when (i) the cost of the programming is reasonably determined, (ii) the programming material has been accepted in accordance with the terms of the agreement, (iii) the programming is available for its first showing or telecast, and (iv) the license period has commenced. There are variations in the amortization methods of these rights, depending on whether the network is advertising-supported (e.g., TNT and TBS) or not advertising-supported (e.g., HBO and Turner Classic Movies).\n\nFor the advertising-supported networks, our general policy is to amortize each program's costs on a straight-line basis (or per-play basis, if greater) over its license period. In circumstances where the initial airing of the program has more value than subsequent airings, an accelerated method of amortization is used. The accelerated amortization upon the first airing versus subsequent airings is determined based on a study of historical and estimated future advertising sales for similar programming. For rights fees paid for sports programming arrangements, such rights fees are amortized using a revenue-forecast model, in which the rights fees are amortized using the ratio of current period advertising revenue to total estimated remaining advertising revenue over the term of the arrangement.\n\nFor premium pay television, streaming and over-the-top (OTT) services that are not advertising-supported, each licensed program's costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over its license period or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. When we have the right to exhibit feature theatrical programming in multiple windows over a number of years, historical audience viewership is used as the basis for determining the amount of programming amortization attributable to each window.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in Stockholders' equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $403 million, a loss of $660 million, and a gain of $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 9 Stockholders' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n## 2. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the years December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\n\n## United States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n",

(Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.\n\nXandr On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr, primarily representing the AppNexus business, to Microsoft, which is expected to close in 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. This advertising business is included in our WarnerMedia segment and is excluded from the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. We applied held-for-sale accounting treatment to the related assets and liabilities of this business, resulting in approximately $550 of goodwill and other intangible assets being reclassified to 'Prepaid and other current assets' as of December 31, 2021.",

Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members' or employees' personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Related to Liquidity\n\n## The long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base ('fixed cost') but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers.\n\nWireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage, in particular, the demand for faster and seamless usage of data, including video, across mobile and fixed devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization, as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work from home trends. We must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations, while remaining competitive. Improvements in these services depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services. In order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our non-fiber wireline areas, we have been expanding our all-fiber wireline network. We must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data, including video, and voice between cell and fixed landline sites. To this end, we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network.\n\nNetwork service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors, including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards, supplier delays, software issues, increases in network and handset component costs, regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements, or labor-related delays. Deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs, then our ability to attract and retain customers, and, therefore, maintain and improve our operating margins, could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service. In addition, we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and IP-based networks. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry's customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategies pursued by competitors. We also expect that our customers' growing demand for high-speed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity. These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to respond will depend, among other things, on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services. These efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and service offerings.\n\n## Intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities, such as new distribution platforms, which may materially adversely affect our operations.\n\nIncreased piracy of video content, products and other intellectual property, particularly in our foreign WarnerMedia operations, will decrease revenues. Technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute high-quality unauthorized copies of content. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate. We may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights. We are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights, could materially adversely impact our operations.",

      "answer": "Piracy negatively affects both NFLX and T by reducing their ability to monetize content and maintain margins. NFLX relies heavily on attracting and retaining members through compelling content, but piracy competes directly with their subscription model by offering 'virtually all content for free,' which threatens their membership growth and, consequently, their margins. T also faces similar challenges, as piracy of video content, especially in international markets, decreases revenues and impacts their WarnerMedia operations. Both companies are forced to invest more in content development, licensing, and anti-piracy measures, which increases costs and places further pressure on margins.",

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

This represents a $1.5 billion (32.6%) increase. In contrast, Disney's total programming and production costs slightly increased by 1% from $13.959 billion in 2023 to $14.081 billion in 2024. Therefore, while both companies experienced increases in programming and production costs, CMCSA's increase related to Peacock was more substantial in both dollar and percentage terms.",

Meanwhile, Comcast's 2023 10-K filing specifically listed 'Programming and Production Costs' as a disclosed expense category, indicating consistent transparency in reporting this major cost line by both companies, though exact figures were not provided by Comcast. This comparison shows that both companies track and disclose this expense category, but only Disney provided detailed numerical trends across two years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Comcast (CMCSA) experienced a decrease in programming and production costs primarily due to the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, which delayed content availability and reduced costs associated with content licensing sales, partially offset by higher theatrical release costs. This led to a decrease in content licensing revenue. At Disney (DIS), programming and production costs included amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, and production costs related to live programming, which were impacted by ongoing labor and production dynamics. These cost structures constrained Disney's ability to increase content licensing revenue in the same period. The combined impact across both companies shows that labor disruptions and shifting content availability significantly influenced their studios' financial performance and cost structures, with CMCSA seeing a temporary cost reduction and DIS facing ongoing cost pressures.",

      "question": "How do the differences in amortization methods for film and television content between CMCSA and DIS affect their respective financial reporting, particularly in terms of revenue recognition alignment and asset classification?",
      "answer": "CMCSA amortizes owned film and television content using the individual film forecast computation method, aligning amortization with the ratio of current revenue to ultimate revenue, while DIS uses either the individual method (based on current to estimated remaining revenue) or the group method (based on projected usage), depending on the monetization strategy. This leads to CMCSA recognizing costs in line with actual revenue generation for individual titles, whereas DIS may accelerate amortization for group content, impacting the timing and magnitude of expense recognition. Additionally, DIS classifies produced and licensed content as long-term assets and content advances as short-term, which affects balance sheet presentation differently than CMCSA's unsegmented capitalization approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA uses the individual film forecast computation method for amortization, based on the ratio of current revenue to ultimate revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - DIS uses either the individual method (based on current to estimated remaining revenue) or the group method (based on projected usage), depending on the monetization strategy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The differing amortization methods result in different financial reporting outcomes: CMCSA aligns costs directly with revenue generation for each title, while DIS may accelerate amortization for group content, affecting expense timing. Additionally, DIS's asset classification (long-term for produced/licensed content, short-term for advances) contrasts with CMCSA's unsegmented capitalization, influencing balance sheet structure."

In the Sports segment, Disney reports programming and production costs primarily include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports programming. Comcast reported programming and production costs of $36,762 million in 2023, which represented approximately 30.2% of its $121,572 million revenue for the year.

      "answer": "CMCSA experienced an increase in international sports programming costs in 2023 due to the timing of recognition of expenses related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which shifted certain European football matches and associated costs from Q4 2022 into the first half of 2023. This timing shift likely required CMCSA to adjust its financial planning to accommodate higher near-term costs for sports content. Meanwhile, DIS disclosed plans to launch Venu Sports, a joint venture with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, aimed at distributing domestic sports networks and streaming services. Although the launch was temporarily enjoined, the proposed collaboration indicates DIS's strategy to pool sports content assets to enhance distribution efficiency and reduce individual cost burdens. Together, these developments suggest that both companies are adapting their financial strategies\u2014one by managing timing-related cost increases in international sports rights, and the other by pursuing a structural partnership\u2014to remain competitive in the high-cost sports programming market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CMCSA's 2023 10-K, extract the specific increase in international sports programming costs due to the timing shift of European football matches related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup into 2023.",
        "Step 2: From DIS's 2023 10-K, extract the disclosure of the Venu Sports joint venture and its temporary legal blockage, noting the strategic intent to distribute sports networks and streaming services collectively.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize how CMCSA's timing-related cost increase in international sports programming may have prompted a reevaluation of financial planning and content acquisition strategies.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize how DIS's Venu Sports initiative reflects a strategic move to consolidate sports content distribution to manage rising programming costs and improve competitive positioning.",
        "Step 5: Conclude that both companies are responding to the financial pressures of sports programming through different mechanisms\u2014CMCSA by navigating timing shifts and DIS by pursuing a joint venture."

      "answer": "Comcast recognizes theatrical revenue as films are exhibited in theaters and receives payment generally within 30 days after exhibition, leading to faster cash inflows. Disney reports theatrical revenue through rentals from licensing films to theaters, which may involve longer payment cycles depending on exhibitor payment terms. This difference in revenue recognition timing results in Comcast experiencing quicker cash conversion from theatrical releases compared to Disney.",

      "answer": "Universal Studios, as part of CMCSA, generated significant revenue from ticket sales at its theme parks, which were dependent on consumer spending on leisure and tourism. This reliance made them vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions and shifting consumer preferences toward other forms of entertainment. Meanwhile, Disney (DIS) diversified its ticket sales beyond theme parks into stage play performances and licensing of IP for theatrical use, allowing it to capture revenue from live entertainment and mitigate some risks associated with theme park volatility. As a result, Disney had a broader revenue base in live audience experiences, while Universal remained more directly exposed to the competitive pressures of the theme park industry.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CMCSA_10k_2023.pdf - Universal Studios' theme park revenue is heavily dependent on ticket sales and in-park spending, which is influenced by travel and tourism trends.",
        "Step 2: Extract from DIS_10k_2023.pdf - Disney generates ticket sales from stage play performances and IP licensing for live theater, in addition to theme parks.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies rely on ticket sales, Disney's diversification into live theatrical experiences provides a broader revenue base, reducing its dependency on theme park performance compared to Universal."

      "answer": "The combined total of ticket sales contributions to revenue recognition timing strategies cannot be numerically calculated as the exact dollar amounts are not disclosed in the provided excerpts. However, the strategies differ significantly: Comcast recognizes revenue from Universal theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used, generally within a year from the date of purchase, and for annual passes, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the pass is available to be used. In contrast, Disney recognizes revenue from ticket sales related to stage play performances at the point of sale when the performance occurs. This indicates that both companies follow different timing mechanisms for revenue recognition based on the nature of their offerings\u2014Universal theme parks use time-based recognition, while Disney's stage play ticket sales align with point-of-sale recognition.",

      "answer": "Comcast's Studios segment earns revenue from theatrical film distribution by receiving a percentage of ticket sales, recognizing revenue as films are exhibited in theaters. This model ties revenue directly to box office performance and results in cash inflows generally within 30 days after exhibition. In contrast, Disney generates ticket sales revenue through stage play performances, which is part of a broader revenue mix that includes home entertainment, licensing, and other diversified sources. These different revenue models impact cash flow timelines: Comcast's theatrical revenue is event-driven and short-term, while Disney's stage play ticket sales contribute to a more staggered and diversified cash flow pattern due to the ongoing nature of theatrical runs and complementary revenue streams. Therefore, Comcast's cash flow is more immediately tied to film performance, whereas Disney's is more sustained and diversified.",

      "answer": "CMCSA amortizes theatrical film costs over 10 years from the initial release, recognizing costs in the same ratio as associated ultimate revenue, which includes all revenue sources within that period. DIS also uses a 10-year window for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees for content used on owned DTC services in its Ultimate Revenues. This means DIS incorporates internal monetization strategies directly into its amortization calculations, while CMCSA focuses on external revenue correlations, leading to different long-term revenue recognition patterns despite similar amortization periods.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA amortizes theatrical film costs over 10 years from initial release using the individual film forecast computation method.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - DIS also uses a 10-year amortization period for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees from owned DTC services in Ultimate Revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies use a 10-year amortization period, but DIS incorporates internal DTC monetization into revenue estimates while CMCSA relies on external revenue correlations, affecting how each recognizes revenue over time."

      "answer": "The cyber attack risks described by CMCSA could disrupt network and service operations, leading to reputational damage and reduced consumer confidence, which may lower discretionary spending on entertainment, including theme park attendance during peak seasons. Similarly, Disney's labor disputes, such as the WGA and SAG-AFTRA work stoppages, have already caused production delays and increased operating costs, which can reduce the availability of new content and experiences that drive attendance. Both factors\u2014cyber risks and labor disruptions\u2014negatively influence the seasonal revenue dynamics of entertainment businesses by reducing consumer demand and operational capacity during high-traffic periods like summer and holidays.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA notes that weak economic conditions and cyber incidents can reduce discretionary spending and negatively impact theme park attendance and theatrical releases.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both cyber risks and labor disputes reduce the attractiveness and availability of entertainment offerings, thereby dampening seasonal revenue peaks tied to theme park attendance and theatrical releases."

      "answer": "CMCSA's Theme Parks segment experienced revenue fluctuations due to seasonal changes in attendance, with peak attendance occurring during the spring holiday, summer months, and winter holiday season. This seasonality directly affected their revenue timing and magnitude. Meanwhile, DIS's Experiences segment also saw attendance-driven revenue seasonality, with increased revenues during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Additionally, DIS faced increased operational costs due to new collective bargaining agreements with labor unions at domestic parks and resorts, which were a direct result of labor disputes in 2023. These higher labor costs, combined with attendance seasonality, affected DIS's profitability and cost structure. Therefore, while both companies experienced revenue seasonality due to theme park attendance patterns, DIS also faced increased cost pressures that CMCSA did not explicitly mention.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's programming and production expenses are tied to the number of subscribers, with fees based on how many customers receive programming, meaning higher subscriber counts lead to higher costs. Meanwhile, GOOGL's revenues from YouTube TV and Google Workspace depend on subscriber counts, causing revenue fluctuations based on changes in the number of users. As a result, both companies are significantly impacted by subscriber dynamics\u2014CMCSA experiences increased cost obligations, while GOOGL sees variability in income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CMCSA's programming expenses are based on the number of subscribers receiving television network programming and include per-subscriber fees.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GOOGL's YouTube TV and Google Workspace revenues are subscription-based and fluctuate with changes in the number of subscribers.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies depend on the 'Number of Subscribers' metric, but in different financial contexts: CMCSA's costs increase with more subscribers, while GOOGL's revenues are directly tied to subscriber count changes."
