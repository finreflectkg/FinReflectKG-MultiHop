      "question": "How does BK's dependency on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet shareholder obligations relate to V's ability to pay preferred stock dividends, given V's repurchase programs and dividend payments in fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "BK, as a non-operating holding company, depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its shareholder obligations, including preferred stock dividends. V paid $3.2 billion in dividends in fiscal 2022 and had $5.2 billion remaining in its December 2021 share repurchase program, which could impact its liquidity and ability to sustain dividend payments. If V reduces its dividend payout due to capital allocation priorities or financial constraints, this could negatively affect BK\u2019s ability to meet its own preferred stock dividend obligations if V is a key subsidiary.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK is a non-operating holding company dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet shareholder obligations, including preferred stock dividends.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - V paid $3.2 billion in dividends in fiscal 2022 and had $5.2 billion remaining in its December 2021 share repurchase program.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If V is one of BK's subsidiaries, then V\u2019s capital allocation decisions\u2014such as large share repurchases and dividend payments\u2014directly affect its ability to provide dividends to BK, which in turn impacts BK\u2019s ability to meet its preferred stock dividend obligations."

All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (1)\n\nFigures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2)\n\nIn  January 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized a $8.0 billion share repurchase program and in December 2021, authorized an additional $12.0 billion share repurchase program (December 2021 Program). As of September 30, 2022, the Company's December 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the December 2021 Program have been completed. In October 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date.\n\nDividends. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company declared and paid dividends of $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion and  $2.7  billion,  respectively.  On  October  21,  2022,  the  Company's  board  of  directors  declared  a  quarterly  cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 1, 2022, to all holders of record as of November 11, 2022.\n\nClass B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current  certificate  of  incorporation)  or  similar  person  or  an  affiliate  of  a  Visa  Member  or  similar  person.  Upon  such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer.\n\nAdjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof)  resulting  in  a  further  corresponding  decrease  in  the  conversion  rate;  or  (ii)  the  final  resolution  of  the  U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding  increase  in  the  conversion  rate.  See Note  5-U.S.  and  Europe  Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nClass C common stock. There are no existing transfer restrictions on class C common stock. As of September 30, 2022, a total of 142 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market.\n\nPreferred stock. In  connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or nonredeemable,  and  has  preference  over  any  class  of  common  stock  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  dividends  and distribution of the Company's assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution.",

      "question": "How does the mention of the effective tax rate in BNY Mellon's 2022 10-K filing relate to the specific effective tax rate of 18.6% reported by Visa in its non-GAAP financials for the same fiscal year?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's 2022 10-K filing explicitly mentions that forward-looking statements include those regarding the effective tax rate, indicating its relevance to the company's financial planning and projections. Meanwhile, Visa's 2022 10-K filing reports a specific non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.6%. This comparison allows analysts to assess how both companies, despite being in the same sector (Financials), manage their tax strategies and how these strategies impact their respective financial outcomes. The explicit mention by BNY Mellon and the concrete figure from Visa suggest that both companies consider the effective tax rate a key financial metric for performance evaluation.",

      "question": "How does the liquidity management strategy reflected in BNY Mellon's regulatory disclosures and PYPL's global cash management practices influence the liquidity ratios of both companies, particularly in relation to their respective regulatory and operational liquidity needs?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's disclosures highlight its focus on regulatory liquidity requirements, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Pillar 3 disclosures, which directly shape its liquidity management strategy to meet regulatory expectations. Meanwhile, PYPL's global cash management practices emphasize balancing customer access to cash with regulatory financial ratio commitments across jurisdictions. The liquidity ratios of both companies are therefore influenced by their respective approaches: BNY Mellon prioritizes regulatory compliance through structured disclosures and stress testing, while PYPL focuses on operational liquidity and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, with $36.1 billion in customer-related assets and $7.4 billion in foreign cash as of December 31, 2021.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies manage liquidity ratios in alignment with regulatory expectations, but through different mechanisms: BNY Mellon through formal disclosures and regulatory frameworks, and PYPL through global cash allocation and customer obligations."

          "chunk_text": "We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters is located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, climate-related events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, heat  waves,  wildfires  and  resultant  air  quality  impacts,  and  power  shutoffs  associated  with  wildfire  prevention.  These  extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition. In addition, current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change (e.g., carbon pricing) and other aspects of ESG (e.g., disclosure requirements) may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations.\n\n## If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.\n\nWe have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter  into  transactions  involving  derivative  financial  instruments  with  various  financial  institutions.  Certain  banks  and  financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage  this  exposure  to  mitigate  the  associated  risk.  Despite  these  efforts,  we  may  be  exposed  to  the  risk  of  default  by,  or deteriorating  operating  results  or  financial  condition  or  failure  of,  these  counterparty  financial  institutions.  If  one  of  our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure  of  one  or  more  of  our  counterparties,  we  could  incur  significant  losses,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\n## There are risks associated with our indebtedness.\n\nWe have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service  such  debt.  Our  outstanding  indebtedness  and  any  additional  indebtedness  we  incur  may  have  significant  consequences, including, without limitation: requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service  our  indebtedness,  thereby  reducing  the  funds  available  for  other  purposes,  including  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions, strategic  investments,  and  share  repurchases;  reducing  our  flexibility  in  planning  for  or  reacting  to  changes  in  our  business, competition pressures and market conditions; and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes.\n\nOur revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the  right  to  demand  immediate  repayment  of  all  borrowings  thereunder  (subject  in  certain  cases  to  a  grace  or  cure  period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\nChanges by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAn increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU Commission, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate.",

      "question": "How does the credit risk concentration with individuals in AXP's unsecured Card Member loans potentially exacerbate BK's concern about credit loss allowance inadequacy under deteriorating economic conditions?",
      "answer": "AXP has a significant credit risk concentration with individuals through unsecured Card Member loans, which are advanced without collateral based on applicant financial history and repayment ability. This increases the likelihood of defaults under economic stress. BK explicitly states that it could incur losses if its allowance for credit losses is inadequate or if expectations of future economic conditions deteriorate. Therefore, if economic conditions worsen, BK's allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses stemming from its exposure to AXP-like credit risk concentrations in unsecured consumer lending, leading to financial losses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AXP has significant credit risk with individuals through unsecured Card Member loans, evaluated based on financial history and repayment ability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BK notes that it could incur losses if its allowance for credit losses is inadequate or if expectations of future economic conditions deteriorate.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AXP's unsecured consumer credit exposure creates a risk of increased defaults during downturns, which feeds into BK's concern that such conditions could overwhelm its credit loss allowance, resulting in material losses."

      "question": "How does BK's reliance on fee-based revenue interact with COF's treatment of fee income as part of total net revenue, particularly when uncollectible fees are charged off?",
      "answer": "BK depends heavily on fee-based revenue for a substantial majority of its income, making it vulnerable to market volatility and underperformance, which could reduce fee-based revenues. Meanwhile, COF recognizes fee income in accordance with contractual provisions and charges off uncollectible fees as a reduction in total net revenue. This means that if market conditions deteriorate for BK, leading to lower fee collections, the impact on BK's revenue would be similar in effect to how COF reduces its total net revenue when fees are deemed uncollectible. Thus, BK's business model is exposed not only to market-driven fee volatility but also to credit risk on fees that, while not explicitly stated, would likely flow through to its financial performance in a manner comparable to COF\u2019s recognition and write-off process.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, BK relies on fee-based business for a substantial majority of its revenue and is exposed to risks that could reduce fee income, such as market volatility and underperformance.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, COF explicitly recognizes fee income contractually and treats uncollectible fees as a reduction in total net revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BK\u2019s exposure to fee income volatility aligns with COF\u2019s experience where uncollectible fees directly reduce net revenue, implying a similar financial sensitivity despite differing business models."

      "question": "How does BK's dependency on subsidiary dividends to fund preferred stock obligations create financial constraints that could impact its earnings per share metric similar to the calculation methodology disclosed by COF?",
      "answer": "BK's Parent company is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including preferred stock dividends. If subsidiaries cannot provide sufficient dividends due to regulatory restrictions or poor performance, BK may struggle to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends. This would trigger restrictions on capital returns and potentially reduce common stockholder distributions. Similar to COF's EPS calculation methodology, which deducts preferred stock dividends from net income before dividing by average common shares outstanding, any inability by BK to pay preferred dividends would directly reduce the residual amount available for common shareholders, thereby lowering earnings per share. The dependency on subsidiary dividends to service preferred stock creates a cascading risk to BK's EPS metric.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK is a non-operating holding company dependent on subsidiary dividends to meet obligations including preferred stock payments, and its ability to return capital to shareholders is constrained by U.S. banking laws and failure to pay preferred dividends",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - COF uses a 'two-class' earnings per share method that deducts preferred stock dividends from net income before calculating EPS for common shareholders",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - BK's dependency on subsidiary dividends to fund preferred stock obligations directly affects its ability to maintain common stockholder distributions. If BK fails to pay preferred dividends, similar to COF's EPS calculation methodology, the residual earnings available for common shareholders would decrease, negatively impacting EPS."

Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the  current  period  and  includes  income  tax  expense  related  to  our  uncertain  tax  positions,  as  well  as  tax-related  interest  and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We subsequently release income tax effects stranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. See 'Note 15-Income Taxes' for additional details.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nEarnings  per  share  is  calculated  and  reported  under  the  'two-class'  method.  The  'two-class'  method  is  an  earnings  allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. We have unvested share-based payment awards which have a right to receive non-forfeitable dividends, which are deemed to be participating securities.\n\nWe  calculate  basic  earnings  per  share  by  dividing  net  income,  after  deducting  dividends  on  preferred  stock  and  participating securities  as  well  as  undistributed  earnings  allocated  to  participating  securities,  by  the  average  number  of  common  shares outstanding  during  the  period,  net  of  any  treasury  shares.  We  calculate  diluted  earnings  per  share  in  a  similar  manner  after consideration of the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include warrants, stock options, restricted stock awards and units, and performance share awards and units. Common stock equivalents are calculated based upon the treasury stock method using an average market price of common shares during the period. Dilution is not considered when a net loss is reported. Common stock equivalents that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. See 'Note 12-Earnings Per Common Share' for additional details.\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nAll  derivative  financial  instruments,  whether  designated  for  hedge  accounting  or  not,  are  reported  at  their  fair  value  on  our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities, with consideration of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral with the same counterparty. We report net derivatives in a gain position, or derivative assets, on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. We report net derivatives in a loss position, or derivative liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. See 'Note 9Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities' for additional details.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

If a major financial institution like COF, which paid $274 million in preferred stock dividends in 2021, were to face regulatory constraints limiting its ability to distribute capital, BK could experience a reduction in cash inflows from its subsidiaries.

      "answer": "AIG's lease liabilities are directly influenced by its cost of funding, as stated in its 10-K filing, where the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities is based on the company's secured borrowing rate. In 2021, AIG reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.60% and lease liabilities of $1.0 billion, showing that an increase in the cost of funding would raise the present value of lease obligations, thereby increasing liabilities on the balance sheet. On the other hand, BNY Mellon acknowledges in its 10-K that an increase in its cost of funding could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. This implies that if BNY Mellon experiences higher borrowing costs, it could reduce profitability, constrain liquidity, and negatively impact its financial stability. Thus, both companies are exposed to the risk of rising funding costs, with AIG facing balance sheet pressure through higher lease liabilities and BNY Mellon facing broader operational and financial risks.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to funding cost risks. AIG's lease liabilities are directly tied to its cost of funding, while BNY Mellon faces broader financial and operational impacts from increased funding costs. This shows a shared sensitivity to the cost of funding, but with different financial implications."

          "chunk_text": "With respect to these other categories of matters not arising out of claims for insurance or reinsurance coverage, we establish reserves for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many instances, we are unable to determine whether a loss is probable or to reasonably estimate the amount of such a loss and, therefore, the potential future losses arising from legal proceedings may exceed the amount of liabilities that we have recorded in our financial statements covering these matters. While such potential future charges could be material, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe, other than as may be discussed below, that any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation.\n\nAdditionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of AIG and our subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries or examinations into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such investigations, inquiries or examinations could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\n\n## Moriarty Litigation\n\nEffective January 1, 2013, the California legislature enacted AB 1747 (the Act), which amended the Insurance Code to mandate that life insurance policies issued and delivered in California contain a 60-day grace period during which time the policies must remain in force after a premium payment is missed, and that life insurers provide both a 30-day minimum notification of lapse and the right of policy owners to designate a secondary recipient for lapse and termination notices. Following guidance from the California Department of Insurance and certain industry trade groups, American General Life Insurance Company (AGL) interpreted the Act to be prospective in nature, applying only to policies issued and delivered on or after the Act's January 1, 2013, effective date. On July 18, 2017, AGL was sued in a putative class action captioned Moriarty v. American General Life Insurance Company, No. 17-cv-1709 (S.D. Cal.), challenging AGL's prospective application of the Act. Plaintiff's complaint, which is similar to complaints filed against other insurers, argues that policies issued and delivered prior to January 1, 2013, like the $1 million policy issued to Plaintiff's husband do not lapse-despite nonpayment of premiums-if the insurer has not complied with the Act's terms. On August 30, 2021, the California Supreme Court issued an opinion in McHugh v. Protective Life Insurance, 12 Cal. 5th 213 (2021), ruling that the Act applies to all policies in force on January 1, 2013, regardless of when the policies were issued. The District Court in Moriarty reached effectively the same result on October 2, 2020, when it held that the Act applied to Plaintiff's husband's 25-year term life insurance policy under the theory that the payment of premiums 'renewed' Plaintiff's policy after the effective date of the Act. However, the District Court in Moriarty also ruled on October 2, 2020 that various fact issues precluded a final determination as to AGL's liability and what (if any) corresponding damages may have resulted. In addition, the District Court denied Plaintiff's motion for class certification without prejudice on November 25, 2020. Proceedings are ongoing in the District Court in the Moriarty case and in other California cases that raise similar industry-wide issues. We have accrued our current estimate of probable loss with respect to this litigation.\n\n## LEASE COMMITMENTS\n\nWe lease office space and equipment in various locations across jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The majority of the resulting obligation arising from these contracts is generated by our real estate portfolio, which only includes contracts classified as operating leases. The lease liability and corresponding right of use asset reflected in Other liabilities and Other assets were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $1.0 billion and $906 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. We made cash payments of $231 million and $252 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with these leases. The liability includes non-lease components, such as property taxes and insurance for our gross leases. Some of these leases contain options to renew after a specified period of time at the prevailing market rate; however, renewal options that have not been exercised as of December 31, 2021 are excluded until management attains a reasonable level of certainty. Some leases also include termination options at specified times and term; however, termination options are not reflected in the lease asset and liability balances until they have been exercised.\n\nThe weighted average discount rate and lease term assumptions used in determining the liability are 2.60 percent and 10.6 years, respectively. The primary assumption used to determine the discount rate is the cost of funding for the Company, which is based on the secured borrowing rate for terms similar to the lease term, and for the major financial markets in which AIG operates.\n\nRent expense was $237 million, $258 million and $232 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n290 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "AIG received $14.699 billion in dividend income from its consolidated subsidiaries in 2021, which significantly supports the Parent company\u2019s ability to meet its capital obligations. This aligns with Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s stated dependency on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund shareholder returns, indicating that consistent and substantial subsidiary dividends are critical for both companies to maintain capital distributions and meet financial commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG received $14,699 million in dividend income from consolidated subsidiaries in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Bank of New York Mellon (BK) states that the Parent company is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet obligations, including shareholder dividends.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AIG's high dividend income from subsidiaries demonstrates how such inflows enable parent companies to fund capital distributions. BK's disclosure reinforces the importance of this income stream for financial stability and shareholder returns.",
        "Step 4: Causal link - A decline in subsidiary dividends would directly impact both AIG\u2019s and BK\u2019s ability to fund shareholder returns and meet capital obligations."

      "answer": "AIG consistently paid $29 million in preferred stock dividends in both 2021 and 2022, indicating a stable commitment to preferred shareholders despite fluctuating net income. In contrast, BK faces multiple financial and operational risks, including sensitivity to interest rate changes, market volatility, and regulatory constraints that could materially impact its profitability and ability to pay dividends. This contrast suggests that AIG, at least in the short term, has maintained a more predictable capital return policy, while BK's ability to sustain preferred stock dividends could be more vulnerable under adverse conditions.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG paid $29 million in preferred stock dividends in both 2021 and 2022, showing consistency despite income volatility.",

      "answer": "Changes in yield curves directly affect AIG's valuation of OTC derivatives, which rely on market-based inputs such as yield curves to determine fair value. AIG uses yield curves as a key input in pricing models for less liquid OTC derivatives, where market evidence is scarce and transaction prices are adjusted based on observable market data when available. For Bank of New York (BK), changes in yield curves are explicitly cited as having a material adverse effect on profitability. This is because BK's fee-based revenue model is sensitive to interest rate shifts, and yield curve changes influence the value of securities and the broader market environment in which BK operates. Therefore, yield curve movements create a dual impact: they alter the fair value of derivative assets for AIG and reduce fee-based income and profitability for BK due to market volatility and reduced client activity.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG uses yield curves as a model input for valuing OTC derivatives, especially in less liquid markets where market evidence is limited.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Yield curve changes influence AIG's derivative valuations and BK's revenue streams, linking both companies through the same macroeconomic factor and showing how it affects their financial performance through different mechanisms."

          "chunk_text": "## Short-term Investments\n\nFor short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\n\n## Separate Account Assets\n\nSeparate account assets are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open-end mutual funds that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity securities traded in active markets.\n\n## Freestanding Derivatives\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\n\nOTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\n\nFor certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nWe value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using prices obtained from vendors and/or counterparties. The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives within Policyholder Contract Deposits\n\nCertain variable annuity and fixed index annuity and life contracts contain embedded derivatives that we bifurcate from the host contracts and account for separately at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. These embedded derivatives are classified within Policyholder contract deposits. We have concluded these contracts contain either (i) a written option that guarantees a minimum accumulation value at maturity, (ii) a written option that guarantees annual withdrawals regardless of underlying market performance for a specific period or for life, or (iii) fixed index written options that meet the criteria of derivatives and must be bifurcated.\n\nThe fair value of embedded derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and fixed index annuity and life contracts is measured based on policyholder behavior and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. These discounted cash flow projections primarily include benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable. In some instances, the projected cash flows from fees may exceed projected cash flows related to benefit payments and therefore, at a point in time, the carrying value of the embedded derivative may be in a net asset position. The projected cash flows incorporate best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization), along with an explicit risk margin to reflect a market participant's estimates of projected cash flows and policyholder behavior. Estimates of future policyholder behavior assumptions are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 201",

      "question": "How does the presence of an allowance for credit losses, as disclosed by AIG in its 2022 10-K, relate to the credit risk exposure highlighted by BK, particularly in light of BK's concern over inadequate credit loss allowances and deteriorating economic conditions?",
      "answer": "AIG's 2022 10-K filing shows that it maintains an allowance for credit losses as part of its accounting policies, specifically referencing its exposure in investments, reinsurance assets, and lending activities. This allowance is a financial buffer to absorb potential losses from credit deterioration. BK, in its 2022 10-K, explicitly states that if its allowance for credit losses is inadequate or if economic conditions worsen, it could incur significant losses. Therefore, the existence of a credit loss allowance, as seen in AIG\u2019s disclosures, is directly relevant to BK\u2019s stated risk regarding insufficient allowances. This implies that both firms are exposed to similar credit risk dynamics, and BK\u2019s concern about inadequate allowances becomes more meaningful when viewed alongside AIG\u2019s actual implementation of such allowances across its financial instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG discloses the presence of an 'Allowance for credit losses' as part of its significant accounting policies, indicating its relevance in managing credit risk across investments, reinsurance assets, and lending activities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - BK states that 'we could incur losses if our allowance for credit losses... is inadequate or if our expectations of future economic conditions deteriorate', highlighting its vulnerability to credit risk.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The allowance for credit losses, as disclosed by AIG, serves as a mechanism to manage credit risk exposure, which BK explicitly identifies as a material risk. This creates a causal and comparative link: AIG\u2019s policy implementation addresses the risk that BK warns could lead to financial loss if not properly managed."

          "chunk_text": "## REVISION OF PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we identified misclassifications related to the balance sheet presentation of certain of our universal life and variable annuity products which resulted in an overstatement of Policyholder contract deposits and an understatement of Future policyholder benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts. These balance sheet-only items had no impact to total liabilities reported, the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in any prior period. Accordingly, the Policyholder contract deposits, and Future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets were decreased and increased, respectively, by $5.8 billion on December 31, 2020 to $154.5 billion and $56.9 billion, respectively.\n\nWe assessed the materiality of the misclassifications described above on prior period financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 99, Materiality, as codified in ASC 250-10, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. We have determined that these misclassifications were not material to the financial statements of any prior annual or interim period.\n\n## 2.

It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the exact impact any such mandates would have on us. In addition, if the vaccines are not as effective as expected, including against new variants of COVID-19, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\n\nDue to the evolving and disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience other potential impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, potential impairment charges to the carrying amounts of goodwill, deferred tax assets, increased reserves to levels that are difficult to accurately estimate and increased morbidity and mortality expectations from longer term consequences of COVID-19 infections. Further, new and potentially unforeseen risks beyond those described above and in other Risk Factors herein may arise as a result of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities to mitigate its impact.\n\nSee also Reserves and Exposures - 'Reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses' and 'Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events' below.\n\nDeterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets may materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. Weaknesses in economic conditions and the capital markets or market volatility have in the past led, and may in the future lead to, among other consequences, a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity, declines in asset valuations and impacts on policyholder behavior that could influence reserve valuations. Key ways in which we have in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to: increases in policy withdrawals, surrenders and cancellations; write-offs of deferred policy acquisition costs; increases in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts; reduced demand for products and services; increases in expenses associated with third-party reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance at acceptable terms; and increased likelihood of, or increased magnitude of, asset impairments caused by market fluctuations.\n\nAdverse economic conditions may result from global economic and political developments, including plateauing business activity and inflationary pressures in developed economies, including the United States, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions, foreign investment restrictions, or military action and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains. These and other market, economic, and political factors have and could continue to have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in many ways, including (i) lower levels of consumer and commercial business activities that have decreased and may continue to decrease revenues and profitability and thus impair goodwill, deferred tax assets or other long-term assets, (ii) widening of credit spreads and higher than expected defaults that could reduce investment asset valuations, increase credit losses across numerous asset classes, and increase statutory capital requirements, (iii) increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity, increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital markets, (iv) the reduction of investment income generated by our investment portfolio, (v) disruption to our business operations in countries experiencing geopolitical tensions as well as increased costs associated with meeting customer needs in such regions, and (vi) impeding our ability to execute strategic transactions.\n\nFor information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, see Market Conditions - 'COVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted' above.\n\nSustained low, declining or negative interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability. Global interest rates have been at or near historic lows, even after an increase in interest rates during 2021. Changes in interest rates may be correlated with inflation trends, which would impact our loss trends. Sustained low interest rates have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the performance of our investments and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios. We experience lower investment income as well as lower sales of new Life and Retirement insurance products and policies when a low or declining U.S. interest rate environment persists, and/or interest rates turn or, in certain circumstances remain negative across various global economies. For example, the current low interest rate environment has negatively affected sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and negatively impacted the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including due to increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. Due to practical and capital markets limitations, we have not been and may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low levels of interest rates have and could continue to impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.\n\n28 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did the changes in average yield on available-for-sale securities between 2020 and 2021 at Charles Schwab (SCHW) influence its net interest revenue growth, and why would this trend be of strategic interest to BNY Mellon (BK), given its forward-looking statements on net interest revenue sensitivity to market conditions?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, yet interest revenue from these securities increased from $1,560 million to $4,537 million due to a significant rise in average balances from $58,181 million to $253,555 million. This contributed to the overall net interest revenue growth from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase. BNY Mellon, in its 10-K, highlights that it monitors net interest revenue closely as part of its financial outlook and risk management, noting its sensitivity to market trends such as interest rates and asset composition. Therefore, BNY Mellon would be strategically interested in understanding how shifts in asset yields and balances impact net interest revenue, as seen at Schwab, to better model and manage its own revenue streams under varying economic conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source B - Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities dropped from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, while average balances increased from $58,181 million to $253,555 million, and interest revenue rose from $1,560 million to $4,537 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Net interest revenue increased from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source A - BNY Mellon includes forward-looking statements regarding its net interest revenue and its sensitivity to market conditions, including interest rates and trends in asset composition.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The yield compression on Schwab\u2019s available-for-sale securities was offset by a large increase in balances, leading to higher interest revenue and overall net interest revenue growth. Given BNY Mellon\u2019s strategic focus on net interest revenue and its sensitivity to market dynamics, such trends in peer institutions would be of strategic interest to inform BNY Mellon\u2019s own forecasting and risk management practices."

      "answer": "Climate change concerns at BNY Mellon (BK) are disclosed to adversely affect client activity levels, which is a key operational metric for Charles Schwab (SCHW). Since Schwab explicitly states its risk related to 'client activity levels' and dependence on managing such activity effectively, any external factors (like climate change) that disrupt client behavior or asset flows could hinder Schwab's ability to maintain operational efficiency and client engagement. This creates a causal chain where BK's climate-related risks indirectly affect SCHW's business performance through shared exposure to client activity levels.",

      "answer": "Climate change concerns are explicitly stated in BNY Mellon's 2022 10-K filing as a risk that could adversely affect its business and impact client activity levels. This implies a potential negative effect on BNY Mellon's operations and revenue due to changes in how clients engage with financial services in response to climate-related concerns. In contrast, Schwab experienced significantly heightened client activity levels in early 2021, which, although initially straining its service quality, was managed through operational improvements such as enhanced self-service capabilities and increased hiring. Schwab's client activity was driven by market engagement rather than climate concerns, and it led to measurable business growth, including $10.6 billion in BDA balance migrations and $281.9 billion in core net new assets in 2020. This shows a divergence: while BNY Mellon anticipates potential negative impacts from climate-related changes in client behavior, Schwab successfully managed and benefited from increased client activity stemming from market dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\nThe Company continued its consistent approach to balance sheet management in 2021, supporting overall growth and liquidity. Total balance sheet assets rose to $667.3 billion at December 31, 2021, increasing 22% from year-end 2020, driven primarily by client asset flows, as well as $10.6 billion in BDA balance migrations. We also added a net $10.2 billion to outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt for liquidity management purposes, and increased preferred stock by a net $2.3 billion to help support continued business growth. The Company's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.2% at year-end 2021.\n\nThough significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021 impacted our service quality at times, we took multiple actions to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on, including enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining our call-routing processes, and increasing hiring. Our efforts began yielding results early in the year, with significant improvement in client service levels by the end of the first quarter, and our service levels continued to be improved throughout the remainder of 2021 as client activity moderated.\n\n## 2020 Compared to 2019\n\nThroughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020, Schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives, and produced solid financial results. The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company's strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company's key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic's rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve's further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&amp;P 500 erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019. \u00ae\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Schwab's net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019. (1)\n\nTotal net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interestearning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion.\n\nGrowing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\n\nTotal expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders' equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. ROTCE was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders' equity and ROTCE were due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio. (1) (1)\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. (1)",

      "answer": "Schwab's IDA agreement requires maintaining a minimum $50 billion sweep balance with TD Depository Institutions through June 2031, limiting Schwab's ability to move these balances to its own banking subsidiaries. This arrangement constrains Schwab\u2019s net interest revenue potential and could result in expenses during low-rate environments. As a financial institution that also manages capital and regulatory disclosures, BNY Mellon must consider how such large-scale balance dependencies in the financial sector, like Schwab\u2019s, might influence broader capital adequacy standards and regulatory reporting practices, particularly under frameworks like the Dodd-Frank Act and Pillar 3 disclosures.",

Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:\n\n- Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition, or ratings from third parties;\n- The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n- Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and\n- Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.\n\nChanges in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.\n\n## Future sales of CSC's equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC's common stock and result in dilution.\n\nCSC's certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC's Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC's common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC's common stock.\n\n## Our ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us.\n\nAlthough our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be 'controlled' by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in 'control' of any of TD Bank's depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve's regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.\n\nUnder the IDA agreement, we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations and adjustments including only moving IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations and maintaining a minimum $50 billion IDA sweep balance through June 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions, resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue.\n\n## Item 1B.

See Fair values of assets and liabilities below in this Note 2 for further information on these repurchase liabilities.\n\n## AFS investment securities\n\nAFS investment securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, other than losses related to credit factors, are reported, net of taxes, in AOCI included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from sales of AFS investment securities are determined using the specific-identification method and are included in other revenue. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the security. Where applicable, prepayments are accounted for as they occur (i.e., prepayments are not estimated).\n\nAn AFS investment security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Management evaluates AFS investment securities with unrealized losses to determine whether the security impairment has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. This evaluation is performed quarterly on an individual security basis.\n\nThe evaluation of whether credit loss exists is inherently judgmental. This evaluation considers multiple factors including: the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; our internal credit ratings; the security's market implied credit spread; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer's industry; and whether all scheduled principal and interest payments have been received.\n\nIf management determines that the impairment of an AFS investment security (or a portion of the impairment) is related to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded for that security through a charge to earnings. The allowance for credit losses is measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of expected cash flows and is limited to the difference between amortized cost and the fair value of the security. The Company estimates credit losses on a discounted cash flow basis using the security's effective interest rate. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded through earnings in the period of the change.\n\nIf it is determined that the Company intends to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before any anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses of that security will be written off and the amortized cost basis of the security will be written down to fair value with any incremental impairment recorded through earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes accrued interest from the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the AFS investment securities for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment of the securities. AFS investment securities are placed on nonaccrual status on a timely basis and any accrued interest receivable is reversed through interest income.\n\n## Securities borrowed and securities loaned\n\nSecurities borrowed transactions require Schwab to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities; the receivables from these transactions are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For securities loaned, Schwab receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\n\n## Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses\n\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is",

      "answer": "The acquisition of TD Ameritrade (TDA) significantly increased Charles Schwab's capital expenditures in 2021, which reached $1.0 billion, up from $741 million in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by higher investments in information technology, telecommunications equipment, and capitalized software costs to support the integration of TDA and enhance Schwab\u2019s technological infrastructure for a growing client base. In 2021, capitalized software costs alone rose to $559 million from $453 million in 2020. Meanwhile, BNY Mellon's competitive environment, as described in its 2022 10-K, emphasized the importance of technological innovation and expertise as key differentiators in the financial services industry. This context likely reinforced the need for firms like Schwab to invest heavily in technology to maintain competitive advantage, especially in areas like digital client experience and operational efficiency.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Schwab's capital expenditures were $1.0 billion in 2021 and $741 million in 2020, with increases attributed to TDA integration and technology upgrades.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Capitalized software costs rose from $453 million in 2020 to $559 million in 2021, reflecting increased investment post-acquisition.",

Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers.\n\nCompetition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services.\n\nFor additional discussion regarding competition, see 'MD&amp;A Risk Factors - Strategic Risk - We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability' and 'MD&amp;A - Risk Factors - Operational Risk - Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees' in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## ITEM 1A.

The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2021 from 2020, primarily from growth in fixed assets from the TDA acquisition. As a result of capital expenditures to support growth in the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade, 2021 also reflected higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, as well as higher depreciation of buildings. The growth in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation and amortization of equipment, office facilities, and property recognized in the TDA acquisition, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our U.S. campuses in 2019 and 2020. As a result of significant capital expenditures in 2021 and anticipated for 2022 as described below, the Company expects to recognize higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2022. The periods over which depreciation and amortization are recognized on these capitalized costs are based on the expected useful lives of the types of assets capitalized and when the assets are placed into service.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2021 from 2020 and in 2020 from 2019 as a result of the acquisitions completed during 2020.\n\nRegulatory fees and assessments increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily as result of the inclusion of TDA's results of operations and overall growth in the business, including higher FDIC assessments due to asset growth. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and higher FDIC insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020.\n\nOther expenses increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA's results of operations and a charge of approximately $200 million for a regulatory matter in 2021 (see Item 8 - Note 15), partially offset by certain lower clearing charges and exchange fees. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily from the inclusion of TDA's results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integration-related costs of $30 million.\n\nCapital expenditures primarily include capitalized software costs, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and buildings. Total capital expenditures were $1.0 billion, $741 million, and $753 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to higher information technology and telecommunications equipment and higher capitalized software costs, partially offset by lower building expansion in 2021. The increases in spending in 2021 reflect investments made to support our TDA integration efforts and enhance our technological infrastructure to support greater capacity for our expanding client base. Capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. Capitalized software costs totaled $559 million, $453 million, and $188 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Investments in information technology and telecommunications equipment were $340 million, $60 million, and $81 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Investments in buildings were $102 million, $173 million, and $397 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\nCapital expenditures were 6% of total net revenues in 2021, within our estimated range for the year. In 2022, we will continue to invest to support the TDA integration and greater capacity for our expanding client base. We anticipate capital expenditures in 2022 will be approximately 4-5% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 35% of total net revenues.",

The integration includes transitioning 14.5 million brokerage accounts and leveraging TD Ameritrade\u2019s platforms like thinkorswim to strengthen Schwab\u2019s competitive position. Schwab also reduced service fees on client cash deposits by 40% under the IDA agreement, from 25 to 15 basis points, to attract and retain clients in a competitive market.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Integration Overview\n\nThe acquisition of TD Ameritrade significantly increases our scale to help support the Company's ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. At the time the acquisition closed, TDA had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. We are actively combining the respective strengths of Schwab and TD Ameritrade and investing in enhanced client experience capabilities to further our financial success for the benefit of clients, employees, and stockholders.\n\nWe expect to transition TDA clients to Schwab within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 date of acquisition. The Company has made significant progress in its efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and has largely completed the rationalization of CS&amp;Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. branch locations. These and other integration activities such as preparation for client transitions are expected to continue throughout the integration process. CS&amp;Co, as well as TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC, will continue to operate as separate broker-dealers to serve their respective clients while integration work continues.\n\nThroughout the integration, the Company plans to generally adopt Schwab platforms and systems, though we're committed to leveraging material advantages in TD Ameritrade's platforms when appropriate, as exemplified by our retention of TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim and thinkpipes trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. We are also retaining TD Ameritrade Institutional's customizable portfolio rebalancing solution iRebal as part of our offering for independent advisor clients. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## IDA Agreement\n\nConcurrently with the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 24, 2019, as amended (the Merger Agreement), CSC entered into an amended and restated insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions (the IDA agreement). In accordance with the IDA agreement, which became effective October 6, 2020, cash held in eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Under the IDA agreement, the service fee on client cash deposits held at the TD Depository Institutions was reduced, relative to TD Ameritrade's agreement prior to acquisition, by 40%, from 25 basis points to 15 basis points for the life of the agreement. Prior to our acquisition, under TDA's prior insured deposit account agreement with the TD Depository Institutions, TDA had floors in place which enabled it to carve-out up to $20 billion of floating-rate investments from the applicable service fee during specified low-rate environments. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, the 15 basis point service fee now applies across all designated fixed and floating IDA balances.\n\nSee 'Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements' (Item 8) Note 3 for more information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition. See also 'Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7) - Capital Management' and Item 8 - Note 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.\n\n## Acquisition of Assets of USAA's Investment Management Company and Other Acquisitions\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA's Investment Management Company (USAAIMCO). Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company's operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA's members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab's retail investors and RIA clients. Also during 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC (Wasmer Schroeder), which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our fixed income lineup.",

      "question": "How do interest rate fluctuations impact fee income for both BK and MET, and through what mechanisms does this occur?",
      "answer": "Interest rate fluctuations impact fee income for both BK and MET through different mechanisms. For BK, fee-based revenues, which constitute a substantial majority of its revenue, could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and yield curves. This is because shifts in interest rates can influence market activity, financial market conditions, and investment preferences, which in turn affect the demand for BK's services and the volume of transactions. For MET, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds. This occurs because rising rates can lead to policyholder surrenders and withdrawals as they seek higher perceived returns elsewhere, reducing account balances and thus fee income. Additionally, falling interest rates may reduce investment spreads, harming profitability and indirectly affecting fee income through product underperformance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK generates a 'substantial majority' of its revenue from fee-based business, which can be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and yield curves.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MET experiences a decrease in fee income due to falling variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds when interest rates rise.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to interest rate risk affecting fee income, but the mechanisms differ: BK through market activity and investment preferences, MET through variable annuity balances and policyholder behavior."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Public Health Risks\n\nPandemics and other public health issues, and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, have affected and may continue to affect economic conditions. They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business  confidence,  behavior  and  activity,  changes  to  interest  rates  and  other  market  risk  factors,  and  governmental  or  other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\n\n## Interest Rate Risks\n\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\n\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other  reasons,  losses  incurred  in  our  general  account  and  the  impact  of  guarantees,  including  increases  in  liabilities,  capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\n\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\n\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived  returns.  This  may  result  in  cash  outflows  requiring  the  sale  of  investments  on  less  favorable  terms,  resulting  in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired ('VOBA'), reducing net income, harming our credit  instrument  covenants  and  rating  agency  assessment  of  our  financial  condition.  Interest  rate  increases  may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity  needs.  Furthermore,  if  interest  rates  rise,  our  unrealized  gains  on  fixed  income  securities  may  decrease  and  our unrealized  losses  may  increase.  We  would  recognize  the  accumulated  change  in  estimated  fair  value  of  these  fixed  income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\n\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\n\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may  not  be  able  to  invest  assets  at  the  full  liability  duration,  thereby  creating  some  asset/liability  mismatch.  In  addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

Governments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our common stock or other securities, or prohibit us from doing so. Our use of other means to return excess capital to shareholders may be less tax-efficient than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets,  and  may  increase  it.  As  a  result,  we  may  have  less  capital  to  devote  to  other  uses,  such  as  innovation,  acquisitions, development  and  return  of  capital  to  shareholders.  We  may  also  be  restricted  from  repurchasing  shares  or  entering  into  share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the 'Series A preferred stock'), junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contract holders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rules  may  limit  our  insurance subsidiaries'  dividends  and  other  payments.  We  may  need  to  transfer  capital  among  our  companies  to  comply  with  net  worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fixed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default  rate  of  our  investment  portfolio  may  increase.  These  changes  could  harm  the  issuers  or  guarantors  of  securities  or  the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain  when  we  sell  assets,  and  our  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.  Legislation  or  regulations  that  would  allow  or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nPandemics and other major public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These have increased and may continue to increase our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price  lower  than  our  carrying  value,  due  to  reduced  liquidity  during  periods  of  market  volatility  or  disruption,  or  other  reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent,  or  fail  to  pay  it,  or  demand  lease  modifications.  We  may  face  moratoriums  on  foreclosures  and  other  enforcement  actions impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.",

      "question": "How does BK's dependency on dividends from its subsidiaries, as mentioned in its 2022 10-K filing, contrast with MetLife's dividend activity from subsidiaries in the same year, based on MetLife's 2022 10-K disclosures?",
      "answer": "BK, as a non-operating holding company, is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and return capital to shareholders, as stated in its 2022 10-K. In contrast, MetLife reported receiving only $14 million in dividends from subsidiaries in 2022, down significantly from $341 million in 2020, according to its 2022 10-K. This shows that while both companies rely on subsidiary dividends, the magnitude and trend of such inflows differ significantly, with MetLife experiencing a sharp decline in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BK's 2022 10-K, extract the statement that 'the Parent is a non-operating holding company and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries... to meet its obligations... and to provide funds for share repurchases and payment of dividends to its stockholders.'",
        "Step 2: From MetLife's 2022 10-K, extract the specific dividend amount received from subsidiaries: '$14 million in 2022', compared to '$341 million in 2020'.",
        "Step 3: Contrast BK's stated dependency on subsidiary dividends with MetLife's actual, and significantly lower, dividend receipts in 2022 to reveal differing dynamics in how each company utilizes or receives such inflows."

      "answer": "BK, as a non-operating holding company, depends on dividends from its subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to meet obligations and fund shareholder returns. If its subsidiaries fail to generate sufficient dividends, BK may be unable to meet its capital needs or pay dividends to shareholders. Similarly, MET relies heavily on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries for holding company free cash flow. If these subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends due to regulatory, tax, or business conditions, MET may need to issue debt or equity or sell assets to fund obligations, and may fail to meet shareholder distribution goals. Both companies face regulatory constraints and internal capital management challenges that limit their flexibility in returning capital to shareholders.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both BK and MET are non-operating holding companies reliant on subsidiary dividends for capital distribution and obligation fulfillment. Regulatory restrictions, internal capital needs, and market conditions can limit subsidiary dividend capacity, directly impacting the holding company's ability to return capital to shareholders or service debt."

Governments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our common stock or other securities, or prohibit us from doing so. Our use of other means to return excess capital to shareholders may be less tax-efficient than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets,  and  may  increase  it.  As  a  result,  we  may  have  less  capital  to  devote  to  other  uses,  such  as  innovation,  acquisitions, development  and  return  of  capital  to  shareholders.  We  may  also  be  restricted  from  repurchasing  shares  or  entering  into  share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.\n\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the 'Series A preferred stock'), junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\n\n## Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\n\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\n\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contract holders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation,  dividend  and  repatriation  rules,  and  monetary  transfer  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rules  may  limit  our  insurance subsidiaries'  dividends  and  other  payments.  We  may  need  to  transfer  capital  among  our  companies  to  comply  with  net  worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\n\n## Investment Risks\n\n## We May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\n\nIn case of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fixed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default  rate  of  our  investment  portfolio  may  increase.  These  changes  could  harm  the  issuers  or  guarantors  of  securities  or  the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\n\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain  when  we  sell  assets,  and  our  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.  Legislation  or  regulations  that  would  allow  or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans could harm our investment portfolio.\n\nPandemics and other major public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These have increased and may continue to increase our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\n\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price  lower  than  our  carrying  value,  due  to  reduced  liquidity  during  periods  of  market  volatility  or  disruption,  or  other  reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent,  or  fail  to  pay  it,  or  demand  lease  modifications.  We  may  face  moratoriums  on  foreclosures  and  other  enforcement  actions impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.",

      "question": "How do the 'dividend stopper' provisions in MetLife's preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures potentially impact the parent company's ability to pay dividends to its common stockholders, and how does this risk compare to the capital return limitations described in Bank of New York Mellon's (BK) 10-K related to preferred stock dividend obligations?",
      "answer": "MetLife's 'dividend stopper' provisions restrict its ability to pay dividends on or repurchase common stock if it fails to pay full dividends on its preferred stock, tying capital returns to performance metrics like RBC ratios, net income, and stockholders' equity. This creates a causal chain where failure to meet these financial thresholds halts common stock dividends. Similarly, BK notes that failure to pay preferred stock dividends limits its ability to return capital to shareholders, subject to regulatory constraints and Delaware law. Both companies show that preferred stock obligations act as a gating mechanism for broader shareholder distributions, with MetLife explicitly outlining conditional restrictions and BK emphasizing regulatory and legal limitations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MET_10k_2022.pdf - MetLife's 'dividend stopper' provisions prevent common stock repurchases or dividends if preferred stock dividends are not fully paid, and are further restricted by RBC ratio, net income, and equity tests.",
        "Step 2: Extract from BK_10k_2022.pdf - BK notes that its ability to return capital to shareholders is limited by U.S. banking laws and the requirement to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both MET and BK face limitations on common stock dividends due to preferred stock obligations, with MET detailing specific financial triggers and BK emphasizing regulatory and legal constraints. This creates a shared causal mechanism where preferred stock dividends act as a prerequisite for broader capital return policies."

Equity (continued)\n\nUnder  the  Delaware  Insurance  Code, American  Life  is  permitted,  without  prior  insurance  regulatory  clearance,  to  pay  a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the amount of the dividend, when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding  calendar  year,  or  (ii)  its  statutory  net  gain  from  operations  for  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year  (excluding realized capital gains), not including pro rata distributions of American Life's own securities. American Life will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend  and  the  amount  thereof  with  the  Delaware  Commissioner  of  Insurance  (the  'Delaware  Commissioner')  and  the Delaware Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as 'unassigned funds (surplus)') as of the immediately preceding calendar year requires insurance regulatory approval. Under the Delaware Insurance Code, the Delaware Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.\n\nUnder  the  Nebraska  Insurance  Code,  Metropolitan  Tower  Life  Insurance  Company  ('MTL')  is  permitted,  without  prior insurance  regulatory  clearance,  to  pay  a  stockholder  dividend  to  MetLife,  Inc.  as  long  as  the  amount  of  the  dividend,  when aggregated  with  all  other  dividends  in  the  preceding  12  months,  does  not  exceed  the  greater  of:  (i)  10%  of  its  surplus  to policyholders  as  of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year,  or  (ii)  its  statutory  net  gain  from  operations  for  the immediately  preceding  calendar  year  (excluding  realized  capital  gains),  not  including  pro  rata  distributions  of  MTL's  own securities. MTL will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Director of the Nebraska Department of Insurance (the 'Nebraska Director') and the Nebraska Director either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution  within  30  days  of  its  filing.  In  addition,  any  dividend  that  exceeds  earned  surplus  (defined  as  'unassigned  funds (surplus)'  excluding  unrealized  capital  gains)  as  of  the  immediately  preceding  calendar  year  requires  insurance  regulatory approval. Under the Nebraska Insurance Code, the Nebraska Director has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\nThe declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the discretion of MetLife, Inc.'s Board of Directors and will depend on its  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  cash  requirements,  future  prospects,  regulatory  restrictions  on  the  payment  of dividends by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, the payment of dividends on MetLife, Inc.'s  common  stock,  and  MetLife,  Inc.'s  ability  to  repurchase  its  common  stock,  may  be subject  to  restrictions  described  below  arising  under  the  terms  of  MetLife,  Inc.'s  Series  A  preferred  stock  and  its  junior subordinated debentures in situations where MetLife, Inc. may be experiencing financial stress, as described below. For purposes of this discussion, 'junior subordinated debentures' are deemed to include MetLife, Inc.'s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, as discussed in Note 15.\n\n## 'Dividend Stopper' Provisions in the Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\n\nIf MetLife, Inc. has not paid the full dividends on its preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period, MetLife, Inc. may  not  repurchase  or  pay  dividends  on  its  common  stock  during  a  dividend  period  under  so-called  'dividend  stopper' provisions. Further, MetLife, Inc.'s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain RBC ratio, net income and stockholders' equity tests at specified times, except to the extent of the net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities during specified periods. If Series A preferred stock dividends or interest on junior subordinated debentures  are  not  paid,  certain  provisions  in  those  instruments  (including  under  'dividend  stopper'  provisions)  may  restrict MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing its common or preferred stock or paying dividends on its common or preferred stock and interest on its junior subordinated debentures.",

      "answer": "BK's dependency on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet shareholder obligations, including preferred stock dividends, is mirrored in MET's explicit payment of preferred stock dividends, such as the $195 million paid in 2021. If MET were to reduce or delay these dividends, it could directly impact BK's ability to satisfy its own preferred stock obligations, creating a cascading financial risk for BK's capital return strategy and shareholder commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK depends on dividends from subsidiaries to meet obligations, including preferred stock dividends.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MET paid $195 million in preferred stock dividends in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since BK relies on dividends from entities like MET, a reduction or delay in MET's preferred stock dividends could impair BK's ability to meet its own shareholder obligations."

      "question": "How does the impact of preferred stock dividends on MetLife's net income available to common shareholders relate to Bank of New York Mellon's risk factors that could constrain its ability to pay dividends, and what does this imply about the stability of shareholder returns in the financial sector?",
      "answer": "MetLife's preferred stock dividends of $195 million in 2021 directly reduce the net income available to common shareholders, which was $6,353 million in that year. This highlights the financial obligation companies in the financial sector face in maintaining preferred dividend payments. Meanwhile, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) discloses several risk factors, such as regulatory constraints, capital adequacy requirements, and the potential impact of economic weakness or cybersecurity incidents, which could materially affect its ability to generate sufficient earnings and maintain dividend payments. Together, these factors imply that while preferred dividends are a binding obligation, broader operational and regulatory risks at firms like BK could constrain their ability to sustain such payments, thereby affecting the stability of shareholder returns across the financial sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - MetLife's preferred stock dividends in 2021 were $195 million, directly reducing net income available to common shareholders to $6,353 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - Bank of New York Mellon identifies multiple risk factors, including regulatory constraints, cybersecurity risks, and economic volatility, that could materially impact its earnings and capital position.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combination of MetLife's dividend obligations and BK's risk exposures reveals a sector-wide dynamic where preferred dividends are a fixed financial commitment, but external and regulatory risks may limit firms' ability to maintain them, affecting shareholder return stability."

      "question": "How do the risks associated with preferred stock dividends at BK potentially affect MetLife's (MET) ability to manage its common stock repurchases and dividend payments?",
      "answer": "BK's risks related to preferred stock dividends, such as the impact of economic weakness, market volatility, and regulatory constraints on its ability to pay dividends, could indirectly affect MetLife (MET) by tightening its capital position. MET paid $195 million in preferred stock dividends in 2021, and if BK's risks lead to a failure to meet capital adequacy standards or trigger regulatory restrictions, MET could face limitations on repurchasing common stock or paying dividends due to 'Dividend Stopper' provisions tied to its preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BK's 10-K, we identify risks such as market volatility, regulatory constraints, and capital adequacy requirements that could impair its ability to pay preferred stock dividends.",
        "Step 2: MET's 10-K reveals that in 2021, it paid $195 million in preferred stock dividends, and its ability to pay common stock dividends or repurchase shares is restricted if preferred dividends are not paid.",
        "Step 3: MET\u2019s common stock repurchases and dividend payments are subject to regulatory restrictions and capital position, which could be negatively impacted if BK\u2019s risks lead to a failure to maintain preferred stock dividend payments.",
        "Step 4: The causal chain is that risks at BK could trigger capital constraints at MET, which in turn would activate 'Dividend Stopper' provisions, limiting MET\u2019s shareholder returns."

We  believe  we  were  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  financial covenants at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Dispositions\n\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company's business dispositions.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Uses\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital' the Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Preferred Stock Redemption\n\nSee  Note  16  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  information  about  the  redemption  of  Series  C preferred stock.\n\n## Common Stock Repurchases\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to authorizations by the Board of Directors to repurchase MetLife, Inc. common stock, amounts of common stock repurchased pursuant to such authorizations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the amount remaining under such authorizations at December 31, 2021.\n\nCommon stock  repurchases  are  subject  to  the  discretion  of  our  Board  of  Directors  and  will  depend  upon  our  capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc.'s common stock compared to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, and other legal and accounting factors. Restrictions on the payment of dividends that may arise under so-called 'Dividend Stopper' provisions would  also  restrict  MetLife,  Inc.'s  ability  to  repurchase  common  stock.  See  '-  Dividends'  for  information  about  these restrictions. See also 'Risk Factors - Capital Risks - We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs.'\n\n## Dividends\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $195 million and $202 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock  of  $1.6  billion  and  $1.7  billion,  respectively.  See  Note  16  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments.\n\nThe declaration and payment of common stock dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc.'s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\n\n## 'Dividend Stopper' Provisions in MetLife's Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\n\nMetLife, Inc.'s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures contain 'dividend stopper' provisions under which MetLife, Inc. may not pay dividends on instruments junior to those instruments if payments have not been made on those instruments. Moreover, MetLife, Inc.'s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would limit the payment of dividends or interest on those instruments if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests ('Trigger Events'), to an amount not greater than the net proceeds from sales of common stock and other specified instruments during a period preceding the dividend declaration date or the interest payment date, as applicable. If such proceeds were under the circumstances insufficient to make such payments on those instruments, the dividend stopper provisions affecting common stock (and preferred stock, as applicable) would come into effect.\n\n## A 'Trigger Event' would occur if:\n\n- the RBC ratio of MetLife's largest U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries' prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around March 1) with state insurance commissioners; or",

      "answer": "BK outlines several operational, regulatory, and market-related risks that could impair its ability to generate stable revenues and maintain financial health. These risks, if realized, could affect BK\u2019s role as a financial institution involved in capital markets and shareholder distributions. MET reports preferred stock dividend payments of $195 million in 2021 and $202 million in 2020, which represent significant outflows to preferred shareholders. If BK\u2019s risks\u2014such as a failure in risk management, cybersecurity incidents, or regulatory actions\u2014materialize, they could disrupt MET\u2019s access to capital or increase its borrowing costs, directly impacting its ability to sustain or grow these preferred stock dividends. This creates a causal chain where BK\u2019s risk exposures indirectly threaten MET\u2019s financial commitments to its preferred shareholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BK outlines multiple risks including operational failures, cybersecurity threats, regulatory actions, and market volatility that could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MET reports preferred stock dividend payments of $195 million in 2021 and $202 million in 2020, indicating a consistent and substantial financial obligation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If BK\u2019s identified risks were to affect the broader financial ecosystem or BK directly, it could lead to tighter credit conditions, reduced capital availability, or increased regulatory scrutiny, which would impact MET\u2019s ability to meet its preferred stock dividend obligations."

MetLife specifically notes that differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates may impact the value and return on financial instruments, investments, and interest rates on debt, which could increase costs or reduce returns. BNY Mellon highlights that increased funding and borrowing costs could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Most settings ceased at the end of December 2021 and the remaining U.S. Dollar settings (overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR) will cease at the end  of  June  2023.  We  continue  to  actively  transition  to  the  alternative  reference  rates.  Differences  between  LIBOR  and  the applicable  alternative  reference  rates  may  impact  the  value  of,  return  on,  and  markets  for,  a  broad  array  of  our  products,  our financial instruments, the instruments in which we invest, or interest rates on our borrowing or debt. The effects on our business and investments  will  vary  depending  on  the  transition  of  our  existing  LIBOR  contracts  to  alternative  reference  rates,  including  the adequacy  of  LIBOR  fallback  provisions  in  such  contracts  and  whether,  how,  and  when  industry  participants  adopt  alternative reference rates for new products or instruments. Uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, regarding the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments, or regarding the application or effectiveness of alternative reference rates, could increase our costs, reduce the value of such instruments, or impair our  cash  or  derivative  positions.  We  may  not  effectively  hedge  or  manage  risks  from  differences  among  applicable  alternative reference rates or timing of when such rates take effect.\n\nWe may fail to adequately prepare for or react to LIBOR discontinuation and replacement, or fail to fully protect ourselves from all the effects of such changes. We may also fail to manage adequately any transition to alternative reference rates in a way that  maintains  the  competitiveness  of  our  products  and  the  performance  of  our  investment  portfolio.  Our  transition  may  not effectively protect other aspects of our business, such as our operations and the accuracy of the financial models and valuations we use to gauge our risks, for financial reporting, or other purposes.\n\nAny such uncertainties or ineffective management may harm our reputation, our relationships with our investors, customers, or regulators, our financial condition, and our business operations.\n\n## Our Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors' or Regulators' Expectations\n\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of ESG standards and expectations. Some of our regulators have proposed or announced that they plan to propose ESG rules or announced that they intend to review our practices against ESG standards; others may yet do so. Further, we define our own corporate purpose, in part, by the sustainability of our practices and our impact on all our stakeholders.\n\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear or readily measurable.  These  standards  and  expectations  may  also,  as  a  whole,  reflect  contrasting  or  conflicting  values  or  agendas.  Our decisions or priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of multiple business goals and interests. Our practices may not change in the particulars or at the rate stakeholders expect. As a result, our efforts to conduct our business in accordance with some or all these expectations may involve trade-offs. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or fully satisfy investors, regulators, or others. Customers and potential customers may be prohibited or choose not to do business with us based on our sustainability practices and related policies and actions. We may face adverse regulatory, investor, media, or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational, or legal challenges.\n\n## Capital Risks\n\n## We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Credit Spread Risks\n\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations  of  our  securities  difficult  if  trading  becomes  less  frequent,  which  may  require  us  to  add  to  our  reserves.  Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments.\n\n## Equity Risks\n\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products' revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products' revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\n\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps ('TRRs'), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\n\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds' need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\n\n## Real Estate Risks\n\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants  and  partners,  capital  markets  volatility,  interest  rate  fluctuations,  commodity  prices,  farm  incomes,  housing  and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures.\n\n## Obligor and Counterparty Risks\n\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.\n\nThe  issuers  or  guarantors  of  fixed  income  securities  and  mortgage  loans  we  own  may  default  on  principal  and  interest payments  they  owe  us.  Additionally,  the  change  in  value  of  underlying  collateral  within  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS'), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\n\nMany  of  our  transactions  with  counterparties  such  as  brokers  and  dealers,  central  clearinghouses,  commercial  banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential  action  by  governments  and  regulatory  bodies,  such  as  controlling  investment,  nationalization,  conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.\n\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) experienced a 50 basis point decrease in its net charge-off rate to 0.37% in 2021, primarily driven by strong credit performance in its auto loan portfolio, including auction price favorability. This indicates improved loan recovery and lower defaults. Meanwhile, PayPal (PYPL) saw a decrease in its net charge-off rate for merchant receivables due to the charge-off of pandemic-impacted accounts in 2020 and improved performance in 2021, partially attributable to tighter eligibility terms and reduced loan sizes. Together, these trends show that both companies saw improved credit performance through a combination of economic recovery and proactive risk management strategies, despite operating in different segments of the financial sector.",

The  associated  loans  and  interest  receivable  have  been  treated  as  troubled  debt restructurings  due  to  the  borrowers  experiencing  financial  difficulty  and  significant  changes  in  their  loan  structure,  including repayment terms and/or fee and rate structure.\n\nModifications  to  the  acceptable  risk  parameters  of  our  credit  products  in  2020  in  response  to  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic resulted  in  the  implementation  of  a  number  of  risk  mitigation  strategies,  including  reduction  of  maximum  loan  size, tightening eligibility terms, and a shift from automated to manual underwriting of loans and advances. These changes in acceptable risk parameters resulted in a decrease in originations in 2020 as compared to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment and such changes in 2021 have resulted  in  a  gradual  increase  in  originations  over  the  past  nine  months.  While  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the economic environment remains uncertain, the longer and more severe the pandemic, the more likely it may have a material adverse impact on our borrowing base, which is primarily comprised of small and medium-sized merchants.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and 'Item 1A.

      "answer": "PYPL implemented tighter eligibility terms, reduced maximum loan sizes, and shifted to manual underwriting in 2020, which led to a decrease in originations but also improved the performance of merchant receivables and reduced the net charge-off rate in 2021. This reflects a proactive risk management strategy to mitigate losses, especially after pandemic-related financial difficulties. COF defines net charge-off rate as (annualized) net charge-offs divided by average loans held for investment, which serves as a key metric for assessing credit risk and loan portfolio quality. PYPL's actions align with the broader concept of managing net charge-offs as defined by COF, but PYPL specifically adjusted underwriting criteria to influence this metric directly.",

        "Step 1: Extract from PYPL - Modifications in 2020 included reduction of maximum loan size, tightening eligibility terms, and shift to manual underwriting, resulting in a decrease in originations and an improvement in the net charge-off rate.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - PYPL's actions directly targeted the components that influence the net charge-off rate (as defined by COF) by reducing credit exposure through tighter controls, thereby lowering defaults and charge-offs."

The  associated  loans  and  interest  receivable  have  been  treated  as  troubled  debt restructurings  due  to  the  borrowers  experiencing  financial  difficulty  and  significant  changes  in  their  loan  structure,  including repayment terms and/or fee and rate structure.\n\nModifications  to  the  acceptable  risk  parameters  of  our  credit  products  in  2020  in  response  to  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic resulted  in  the  implementation  of  a  number  of  risk  mitigation  strategies,  including  reduction  of  maximum  loan  size, tightening eligibility terms, and a shift from automated to manual underwriting of loans and advances. These changes in acceptable risk parameters resulted in a decrease in originations in 2020 as compared to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment and such changes in 2021 have resulted  in  a  gradual  increase  in  originations  over  the  past  nine  months.  While  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the economic environment remains uncertain, the longer and more severe the pandemic, the more likely it may have a material adverse impact on our borrowing base, which is primarily comprised of small and medium-sized merchants.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and 'Item 1A.

This indicates that the release of reserves offset some credit risk costs. Meanwhile, COF noted a reduction in legal reserve builds, which partially offset the decline in net interest income and contributed to lower non-interest expenses. The reduction in reserve builds for COF improved its loss position by lowering expenses, while PYPL's reserve release had a direct effect of reducing its credit losses.

      "answer": "The difference in net charge-off rates between COF (1.90%) and PYPL's methodology (excluding fraud losses) indicates that COF's loan portfolio includes fraud-related credit losses in its calculation, suggesting a broader inclusion of risk factors in its credit performance metric. PYPL's definition reveals that their net charge-off rate specifically excludes fraud losses, implying a narrower scope focused only on non-fraud-related credit defaults. This distinction suggests that COF may adopt a more comprehensive approach to credit risk reporting, while PYPL separates fraud risk from traditional credit risk in its evaluation framework.",

      "answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported a decrease in its net charge-off rate by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in its energy loan portfolio. This reflects an improvement in credit performance and economic conditions, especially in the energy sector, compared to 2020. In contrast, PayPal (PYPL) defines its net charge-off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily balance of those receivables. While COF's metric reflects a specific improvement in a core loan segment (energy), PYPL's definition emphasizes a structural, formulaic approach focused on merchant credit risk without factoring in fraud, indicating differing risk management frameworks and portfolio compositions between the two financial institutions.",

      "answer": "The difference in net charge-off rates between COF (0.37%) and PYPL's definition of the metric\u2014excluding fraud losses on merchant loans and advances\u2014reflects contrasting credit risk management approaches. COF's lower net charge-off rate indicates stronger credit quality and loss mitigation in its loan portfolio, particularly in auto and consumer banking. PYPL, by excluding fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, highlights a different risk exposure tied to merchant loans and advances, which may carry unique credit risks not captured in the metric.

      "question": "How did the change in the Net Charge-Off Rate for Capital One's Credit Card business in 2021 impact its financial performance, and how does PayPal's definition of Net Charge-Off Rate suggest this metric might influence its own credit risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) experienced a 198 basis point decrease in its Net Charge-Off Rate to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million due to strong credit performance. This improvement indicates better loan recovery or fewer defaults, which enhances profitability and reduces risk. PayPal (PYPL), on the other hand, defines its Net Charge-Off Rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily loan balance. This definition implies that PYPL\u2019s credit risk exposure is directly tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, and a higher Net Charge-Off Rate would signal increased credit deterioration and potential financial loss.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, COF's Net Charge-Off Rate decreased by 198 basis points to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, PYPL defines Net Charge-Off Rate as the ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud) on merchant loans and advances to the average daily loan balance, indicating that this metric directly reflects credit performance and risk exposure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: COF\u2019s improved Net Charge-Off Rate positively impacted its financial results by reducing credit loss provisions. PYPL\u2019s definition shows that a similar metric would directly affect its financial exposure, implying that a deterioration in its Net Charge-Off Rate would increase its credit risk and financial burden."

      "answer": "PYPL explicitly excludes fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, whereas COF does not specify such an exclusion in its reporting. This difference in methodology makes it difficult to directly compare COF's 0.37% net charge-off rate in 2021 with PYPL's rate, as PYPL's metric reflects only non-fraud credit losses, potentially presenting a more favorable credit performance picture for PYPL if fraud losses were material.",

        "Step 1: From PYPL's 10-K, we learn that their net charge-off rate specifically excludes fraud losses, focusing only on credit losses on merchant loans and advances.",
        "Step 2: From COF's 10-K, we see that their reported net charge-off rate for 2021 was 0.37%, but there is no mention of excluding fraud losses from this calculation.",

Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis.

      "answer": "COF's net charge-off rate decreased from 0.87% in 2020 to 0.37% in 2021, reflecting a significant improvement in loan performance, particularly in auto lending. This led to a decrease in net charge-offs from $578 million in 2020 to $276 million in 2021, a reduction of $302 million. In contrast, PYPL's net charge-off rate also decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, but this was attributed to proactive risk mitigation strategies such as tightening eligibility terms, reducing loan sizes, and shifting to manual underwriting in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. These strategies led to improved performance and a lower charge-off rate for merchant receivables. Thus, both companies experienced a decline in net charge-off rates, but COF's improvement was quantifiably larger in dollar terms, while PYPL's was a result of strategic risk adjustments.",

The  associated  loans  and  interest  receivable  have  been  treated  as  troubled  debt restructurings  due  to  the  borrowers  experiencing  financial  difficulty  and  significant  changes  in  their  loan  structure,  including repayment terms and/or fee and rate structure.\n\nModifications  to  the  acceptable  risk  parameters  of  our  credit  products  in  2020  in  response  to  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic resulted  in  the  implementation  of  a  number  of  risk  mitigation  strategies,  including  reduction  of  maximum  loan  size, tightening eligibility terms, and a shift from automated to manual underwriting of loans and advances. These changes in acceptable risk parameters resulted in a decrease in originations in 2020 as compared to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment and such changes in 2021 have resulted  in  a  gradual  increase  in  originations  over  the  past  nine  months.  While  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the economic environment remains uncertain, the longer and more severe the pandemic, the more likely it may have a material adverse impact on our borrowing base, which is primarily comprised of small and medium-sized merchants.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Note 11-Loans and Interest Receivable' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and 'Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur credit products expose us to additional risks ' included in this Form 10-K.\n\n## Customer support and operations\n\nCustomer support and operations includes costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers, and other costs incurred  related  to  the  delivery  of  our  products,  including  payment  devices,  card  production,  and  customer  onboarding  and compliance costs.\n\nCustomer support  and  operations  costs  increased  $297  million,  or  17%,  in  2021  compared  to  2020.  The  increase  in  2021  was primarily attributable to increases in employee-related expenses, customer onboarding and compliance costs, and contractors and consulting costs that support the growth of our active accounts and payment transactions.",

Mastercard (MA) generated $4.8 billion in cross-border volume revenue from its International Payments segment, contributing to 30% of its total gross revenue. Together, the combined international payments revenue from both companies was $6.0 billion. However, to assess the proportional impact on their overall business, we calculate: COF's total revenue was $15 billion (since $1.2B is 8%), and MA's total revenue was $16 billion (since $4.8B is 30%). Thus, the international payments segments contributed a combined $6.0 billion out of a total $31 billion in revenue between the two firms, representing approximately 19.35% of their total revenue base.",

If Capital One\u2019s customers use less of their available credit than expected, this could lead to lower transaction volumes than anticipated, which in turn affects Mastercard\u2019s estimation accuracy and rebate obligations.

These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides certain customers with rebates and incentives which totaled $11.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives that could be either fixed or variable-based. Variable rebates and incentives are recorded  as  a  reduction  of  gross  revenue  primarily  when  volume-  and  transaction-based  revenues  are  recognized  over  the contractual  term.  Variable  rebates  and  incentives  are  calculated  based  upon  estimated  customer  performance,  such  as  volume thresholds,  and  the  terms  of  the  related  business  agreements. As  disclosed  by  management,  various  factors  are  considered  in estimating  customer  performance,  including  forecasted  transactions,  card  issuance  and  card  conversion  volumes,  expected payments and historical experience with that customer.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to rebates and incentives is a critical audit matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  by  management  when  developing  estimates  related  to  rebates  and  incentives  based  on customer performance; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's  estimates  related  to  customer  performance,  including  the  reasonableness  of  the  various  applicable  factors considered by management in the estimate.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to rebates and incentives,  including  controls  over  evaluating  estimated  customer  performance.

      "answer": "Mastercard's expansion into services like Mastercard Send\u2122 and Track BPS improves portfolio performance by capturing new payment flows and enhancing the efficiency and security of transactions, which in turn strengthens customer relationships and differentiates offerings. These services also support open banking and digital identity platforms, which increase the intelligence and security of payments.

          "chunk_text": "underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we closely monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure  and  performance  of  our  lending  related  transactions.  Our  Consumer  and  Commercial  Chief  Credit  Officers  are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new  credit  investments.  They  also  have  formal  approval  authority  for  various  types  and  levels  of  credit  decisions,  including individual  commercial  loan  transactions.  Division  Presidents  within  each  segment  are  responsible  for  managing  the  credit  risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur  credit  policies  establish  standards  in  five  areas:  customer  selection,  underwriting,  monitoring,  remediation  and  portfolio management.  The  standards  in  each  area  provide  a  framework  comprising  specific  objectives  and  control  processes.  These standards  are  supported  by  detailed  policies  and  procedures  for  each  component  of  the  credit  process.  Starting  with  customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor  performance  relative  to  these  guidelines  and  report  results  and  any  required  mitigating  actions  to  appropriate  senior management committees and our Board of Directors.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management\n\nWe manage liquidity  risk  by  applying  our  Liquidity  Framework.  The  Liquidity  Framework  uses  internal  and  regulatory  stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery Plans, which include the Company's policies, procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. The Liquidity Framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Liquidity  Framework  establishes  governing  principles  that  apply  to  the  management  of  liquidity  risk.  We  use these  principles  to  monitor,  measure  and  report  liquidity  risk;  to  develop  funding  and  investment  strategies  that  enable  us  to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant  funding  degradation  through  systemic,  idiosyncratic,  and  combined  liquidity  stress  scenarios.  Management  reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees no less than quarterly and to our Board of Directors no less than semi-annually.\n\nWe seek to mitigate  liquidity  risk  strategically  and  tactically.  From  a  strategic  perspective,  we  have  acquired  and  built  deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. This combination of stable  and  diversified  funding  sources  and  our  stockpile  of  liquidity  reserves  enable  us  to  maintain  confidence  in  our  liquidity position.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level.

They also power our open banking and digital identity platforms\n- New network opportunities strengthen  our  digital  payments  value  proposition,  including  improved  authentication  with  digital identity, and new opportunities to develop and embed services in our expanding product offerings\n\n## Powering Our Success\n\nThese priorities are supported by six key drivers:\n\nPeople.

Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers. It enables broader reach to scale digital payment services to multiple channels, including mobile devices. Our technology standards, services and governance model help us to serve as the connection that allows financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others to interoperate and enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.",

      "answer": "COF spent $7,605 million on purchases of treasury stock in 2021, while MA spent $5,934 million in the same year. This resulted in COF having a significantly lower net cash from financing activities ($-7,030 million), whereas MA's treasury stock purchases were reflected in a direct reduction of its stockholders' equity by $5,934 million, as shown in the equity reconciliation. COF\u2019s larger treasury stock outflow contributed to a smaller increase in its cash and cash equivalents compared to MA\u2019s broader equity adjustments.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF spent $7,605 million on purchases of treasury stock in 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MA spent $5,934 million on purchases of treasury stock in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source A - COF\u2019s net cash from financing activities was $-7,030 million in 2021, heavily influenced by the treasury stock purchases.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source B - MA\u2019s stockholders' equity was directly reduced by $5,934 million due to treasury stock purchases, as shown in the equity reconciliation table.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - COF\u2019s treasury stock activity had a larger cash flow impact, while MA\u2019s treasury stock activity directly reduced equity, showing different financial statement effects despite similar corporate behavior."

      "answer": "COF's 2021 purchases of treasury stock were $7,605 million, while MA's were $5,904 million, resulting in a difference of $1,701 million. This difference significantly influenced their net cash used in financing activities, with COF reporting $7,605 million in outflows for treasury purchases (a major component of its total financing outflow of $474 million inflow) and MA reporting $5,904 million in outflows as part of a broader $6,555 million net cash outflow in financing activities. The combined treasury stock repurchase impact was $13,509 million, which constrained their financial flexibility by reducing available cash for strategic investments, debt reduction, or operational enhancements.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF's 2021 purchases of treasury stock were $7,605 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - MA's 2021 purchases of treasury stock were $5,904 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference: $7,605 million (COF) - $5,904 million (MA) = $1,701 million difference in treasury stock purchases.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the impact on net cash used in financing activities: COF had $7,605 million outflow as part of a broader financing activity that ended in a $474 million net inflow, while MA had $5,904 million outflow as part of a $6,555 million total net cash outflow in financing activities.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The combined impact of both companies\u2019 treasury stock purchases was $13,509 million, which significantly reduced their financial flexibility by limiting available liquidity for other strategic or operational uses."

      "question": "How much more did COF spend on purchases of treasury stock in 2021 compared to MA's purchases of treasury stock in 2021, and what was the impact on their respective stockholders' equity?",
      "answer": "COF spent $7,605 million on purchases of treasury stock in 2021, while MA spent $5,934 million in the same year. This means COF spent $1,671 million more than MA. For COF, this large outflow contributed to a decrease in net cash from financing activities from $25,164 million in 2020 to $474 million in 2021. For MA, the purchase of treasury stock reduced stockholders' equity from $7,312 million at the beginning of the year to $7,312 - $5,934 = $1,378 million by the end of 2021.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF spent $7,605 million on purchases of treasury stock in 2021.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $7,605 - $5,934 = $1,671 million.",

        "Step 5: Analyze impact on MA's equity - MA's stockholders' equity related to treasury stock was reduced from $7,312 million to $1,378 million after the purchase."

The combined change in these metrics from 2018 to 2021 shows contrasting financial strategies: COF maintained relative stability in goodwill balances, indicating consistent asset valuation, whereas MA significantly reduced outstanding shares through treasury purchases, suggesting a capital return strategy to shareholders.",

The 2019 discrete tax benefits related to a favorable court ruling, a reduction to the Company's transition tax liability and additional foreign tax credits which can be carried back under U.S. tax reform transition rules issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n## Singapore Income Tax Rate\n\nIn connection with the expansion of the Company's operations in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, the Company's subsidiary  in  Singapore,  Mastercard Asia  Pacific  Pte.  Ltd.  ('MAPPL')  received  an  incentive  grant  from  the  Singapore  Ministry  of Finance in 2010. The incentive had provided MAPPL with, among other benefits, a reduced income tax rate for the 10-year period commencing  January  1,  2010  on  taxable  income  in  excess  of  a  base  amount.  The  Company  continued  to  explore  business opportunities in this region, resulting in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the Ministry of Finance, including a further reduction  to  the  income  tax  rate  on  taxable  income  in  excess  of  a  revised  fixed  base  amount  commencing  July  1,  2011  and continuing through December 31, 2025. Without the incentive grant, MAPPL would have been subject to the statutory income tax rate on its earnings. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, the impact of the incentive grant received from the Ministry of Finance resulted in a reduction of MAPPL's income tax liability of $300 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, $260 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, and $300 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, respectively.\n\n## Indefinite Reinvestment\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  the  Company  had  immaterial  deferred  tax  liabilities  related  to  the  tax  effect  of  the  estimated  foreign exchange impact on unremitted earnings. The Company expects that foreign withholding taxes associated with future repatriation of these  earnings  will  not  be  material.  Earnings  of  approximately  $1.1  billion  remain  permanently  reinvested  and  the  Company estimates that immaterial U.S. federal and state and local income tax benefits would result, primarily from foreign exchange, if these earnings were to be repatriated.\n\n102 MASTERCARD 2021 FORM 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate  of  defaults  by  account  holders  and  borrowers  domestically  and  internationally.  These  social  factors  include  changes  in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if  consumption  trends  decline  or  if  we  fail  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brand,  or  we  incur  significant  expenses  to  do  so,  our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and  distribution  of  our  other  proprietary  information.  These  measures  may  not  prevent  misappropriation  of  our  proprietary information  or  infringement  of  our  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  resulting  loss  of  competitive  advantage.  In  addition,  our competitors  or  other  third  parties  may  obtain  patents  for  innovations  that  are  used  in  our  industry  or  allege  that  our  systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. If our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining  such  patents  or  prevail  in  intellectual  property-related  litigation  against  us,  we  could  lose  significant  revenues,  incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant damages.\n\n## Our  risk  management  strategies  may  not  be  fully  effective  in  mitigating  our  risk  exposures  in  all  market  environments  or against all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational and compliance risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. See 'MD&amp;A-Risk Management' for further details. Even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework, our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. These  methods  may  not  accurately  predict  future  exposures,  which  could  be  significantly  greater  than  the  historical measures  indicate  and  market  conditions,  particularly  during  a  period  of  financial  market  stress,  can  involve  unprecedented dislocations. For example, credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers. Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs due, for example,  to  rapid  changes  in  the  economy,  or  degradation  in  the  predictive  nature  of  credit  bureau  and  other  data  used  in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that  accompany  their  application  cannot  anticipate  every  economic  and  financial  outcome  or  the  timing  of  such  outcomes.  For example, our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result, may limit our ability to distribute such risks (for instance, when we seek to syndicate exposure  in  bridge  financing  transactions  we  have  underwritten).  We  may,  therefore,  incur  losses  in  the  course  of  our  risk management or investing activities.\n\n## Fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility  in  the  capital  markets  could  adversely  affect  our  income  and  expense,  the value of assets and obligations, our regulatory capital, cost of capital or liquidity.\n\nLike other financial institutions,  our  business  is  sensitive  to  market  interest  rate  movements  and  the  performance  of  the  capital markets. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity, limit our access to the funding and capital required to operate and grow our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. For example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interest-earning assets. We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and  depositors.  The  interest  rates  that  we  pay  on  the  securities  we  have  issued  are  also  influenced  by,  among  other  things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Increased chargeoffs, rising interest rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.

In particular, a violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AML, CFT, and anti-corruption  laws  could  subject  us  to  substantial  monetary  penalties,  damages,  and/or  have  a  significant reputational impact.

Any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could impact our relationships with our customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Business and Operations\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe  global  COVID-19  pandemic  and  measures  taken  in  response  have  adversely  impacted  our  business,  results  of operations and financial condition, and may continue to do so depending on future developments, which are uncertain.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to have negative effects on the global economy. The pandemic has affected business activity, adversely impacting consumers, our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as our workforce. Variants of the virus have emerged, resulting in a resurgence of infections that have affected regions at different times. New variants may emerge with similar results. The extent to which the resurgence and severity of infections has affected, and may in the future affect, regions is  impacted  by  the  ongoing  global  administration  of  vaccines  and  the  availability  of  therapeutic  treatments  in  those  locations. Governments, businesses and consumers continue to react to the changing conditions, tightening or loosening safety measures or voluntarily making personal safety decisions, as applicable, based on the current environment of their location.\n\nThe pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and working in remote or hybrid environments).

          "chunk_text": "In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate  of  defaults  by  account  holders  and  borrowers  domestically  and  internationally.  These  social  factors  include  changes  in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if  consumption  trends  decline  or  if  we  fail  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brand,  or  we  incur  significant  expenses  to  do  so,  our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and  distribution  of  our  other  proprietary  information.  These  measures  may  not  prevent  misappropriation  of  our  proprietary information  or  infringement  of  our  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  resulting  loss  of  competitive  advantage.  In  addition,  our competitors  or  other  third  parties  may  obtain  patents  for  innovations  that  are  used  in  our  industry  or  allege  that  our  systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. If our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining  such  patents  or  prevail  in  intellectual  property-related  litigation  against  us,  we  could  lose  significant  revenues,  incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant damages.\n\n## Our  risk  management  strategies  may  not  be  fully  effective  in  mitigating  our  risk  exposures  in  all  market  environments  or against all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational and compliance risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. See 'MD&amp;A-Risk Management' for further details. Even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework, our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. These  methods  may  not  accurately  predict  future  exposures,  which  could  be  significantly  greater  than  the  historical measures  indicate  and  market  conditions,  particularly  during  a  period  of  financial  market  stress,  can  involve  unprecedented dislocations. For example, credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers. Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs due, for example,  to  rapid  changes  in  the  economy,  or  degradation  in  the  predictive  nature  of  credit  bureau  and  other  data  used  in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that  accompany  their  application  cannot  anticipate  every  economic  and  financial  outcome  or  the  timing  of  such  outcomes.  For example, our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result, may limit our ability to distribute such risks (for instance, when we seek to syndicate exposure  in  bridge  financing  transactions  we  have  underwritten).  We  may,  therefore,  incur  losses  in  the  course  of  our  risk management or investing activities.\n\n## Fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility  in  the  capital  markets  could  adversely  affect  our  income  and  expense,  the value of assets and obligations, our regulatory capital, cost of capital or liquidity.\n\nLike other financial institutions,  our  business  is  sensitive  to  market  interest  rate  movements  and  the  performance  of  the  capital markets. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity, limit our access to the funding and capital required to operate and grow our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. For example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interest-earning assets. We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and  depositors.  The  interest  rates  that  we  pay  on  the  securities  we  have  issued  are  also  influenced  by,  among  other  things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Increased chargeoffs, rising interest rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.

Our core network supports what is often referred to as a 'four-party' payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).\n\nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers,  or  establish  the  rates  charged  by  acquirers  in  connection  with  merchants'  acceptance  of  our  products.  In  most  cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\n\nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core network, and our role in that transaction:\n\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the 'merchant discount' rate), to the merchant.\n\n- Interchange Fees. Interchange  fees  reflect  the  value  merchants  receive  from  accepting  our  products  and  play  a  key  role  in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased  sales  to  their  existing  and  new  customers,  efficiencies  in  the  delivery  of  existing  and  new  products,  guaranteed payments and improved experience for the customers. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish 'default interchange fees' that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n- Additional  Four-Party  System  Fees. The  merchant  discount  rate  is  established  by  the  acquirer  to  cover  its  costs  of  both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related  fees  in  addition  to  the  merchant  discount  rate.  Issuers  may  also  charge  account  holders  fees  for  the  transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.\n\n## Switched Transactions\n\n- Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval,  facilitate  the  exchange  of  financial  transaction  information  between  issuers  and  acquirers  after  a  successfully conducted  transaction,  and  settle  the  transaction  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  funds  between  parties  via  settlement  banks chosen by us and our customers.\n- Cross-Border and Domestic.

Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers' success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in 'Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.\n\nWith the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships  with  account  holders,  we  depend  on  our  close  working  relationships  with  our  customers  to  effectively  manage  our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Merchants' continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nMerchants  are  important  constituents  in  our  payments  system.  We  rely  on  both  our  relationships  with  them,  as  well  as  their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase  revenues  and  fight  fraud.  In  the  retail  industry,  there  is  a  set  of  larger  merchants  with  increasingly  global  scope  and influence.  We  believe  that  these  merchants  are  having  a  significant  impact  on  all  participants  in  the  global  payments  industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard  has  been  defending,  including  the  U.S.  merchant  litigations.  Some  merchants  are  increasingly  asking  regulators  to review  and  potentially  regulate  our  own  network  fees,  in  addition  to  interchange.  See  our  risk  factor  in  'Risk  Factors  -  Other Regulation' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nCertain  larger  merchants  are  also  able  to  negotiate  incentives  from  us  and  pricing  concessions  from  our  issuer  and  acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.\n\n## Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAs  we  increase  our  work  with  national,  state  and  local  governments,  both  indirectly  through  financial  institutions  and  with  them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions  in  governmental  operations,  could  impact  approved  funding  and  result  in  changes  in  the scope,  or  lead  to  the  termination,  of  the  arrangements  or  contracts  we  or  financial  institutions  enter  into  with  respect  to  our payment products and services.",

      "answer": "The competitive and regulatory pressures on interchange fees described by COF could reduce the interchange revenue that card issuers like COF earn, which in turn may lead to tighter collaboration between networks like MA and their issuing and acquiring partners to maintain profitability. MA, which depends on these partners to set competitive program features, may face increased pressure to provide larger incentives to merchants to maintain acceptance and co-branding partnerships, as noted in MA's 10-K. This could materially and adversely affect MA\u2019s profitability, especially if larger merchants continue to negotiate lower interchange rates and demand more concessions, as MA acknowledges in its risk factors. Additionally, if interchange fee caps or litigation outcomes reduce interchange revenues, MA\u2019s issuing partners may have less margin to invest in marketing or co-branding initiatives, further limiting MA\u2019s ability to grow its network acceptance and brand strength.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (COF_10k_2022.pdf) - COF highlights that interchange fees are a meaningful source of revenue and are under regulatory and competitive pressure globally, with examples such as caps in the U.K. and Canada, and potential for further reductions due to litigation and merchant negotiations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (MA_10k_2022.pdf) - MA states that it depends on issuing and acquiring partners to determine competitive features of payment programs and that it may need to increase incentives to merchants, which could materially affect profitability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Regulatory reductions in interchange fees (COF) reduce issuer revenues, which may limit the financial capacity of MA\u2019s issuing partners to invest in co-branding or marketing. This forces MA to offer more incentives to merchants to maintain acceptance and co-branding, increasing MA\u2019s costs and reducing profitability, as MA explicitly warns in its risk factors."

          "chunk_text": "Some of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer, or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, attain and develop more attractive co-brand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors.\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering  of  interest  rates  or  fees  that  we  might  implement  to  retain  customers,  could  reduce  our  revenues  and  therefore  our earnings. Similarly, unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\n\n## Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants' increasing focus on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees.\n\nInterchange fees are generally one of the largest components of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of credit and debit cards and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit and debit card businesses. Interchange fees are the subject  of  significant  and  intense  global  legal,  legislative  and  regulatory  focus,  and  the  resulting  decisions,  legislation  and regulation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number of countries are seeking to reduce interchange fees through legislation, competitionrelated regulatory proceedings, voluntary agreements, central bank regulation and/or litigation. For credit transactions, interchange reimbursement  rates  in  the  United  States  are  set  by  credit  card  networks  such  as  MasterCard  and  Visa.  For  debit  transactions, Federal  Reserve  rules  place  limits  on  the  interchange  fees  we  may  charge.  For  more  information  on  these  rules,  including  the Federal  Reserve's  proposed  amendments,  please  see  'Part  I-Item  1.  Business-Supervision  and  Regulation.'  In  some jurisdictions, such as Canada and certain countries in Europe, including the U.K., interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity, including in some cases, imposing caps on permissible interchange fees. Our international card businesses have been impacted by these restrictions. For example, in the U.K., interchange fees are capped for both credit and debit card transactions. In addition, in Canada, Visa and Mastercard payment networks have, since 2014, entered into voluntary agreements with the Department of Finance Canada to maintain an agreed upon average interchange rate. Lowering interchange fees remains an area of domestic and international governmental focus. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another, such as our primary market, the United States.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity, merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees. During the past few years, merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard, American Express and their card-issuing banks, claiming that their practices toward merchants, including interchange and similar fees, violate federal antitrust laws. In 2005, a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us,  alleging  among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. In December 2013, the U.S. District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  New  York  granted  final  approval  of  the  proposed  class  settlement.  The  settlement provided, among other things, that merchants would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fees. The settlement was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected the settlement in June 2016; a revised settlement was reached in  the  second  half  of  2018,  and  the  trial  court  issued  its  final  approval  of  the  settlement  in  December  2019.  See  'Note  18Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others' for further details.\n\nSome major retailers may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa, which could, in turn, result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers.  In  2016,  some  of  the  largest  merchants  individually  negotiated  lower  interchange  rates  with  MasterCard  and/or  Visa. These and other merchants also continue to lobby aggressively for caps and restrictions on interchange fees and their efforts may be successful or they may in the future bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks.\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees, such as ACH-based payments, or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards. New payment systems, particularly  mobile-based  payment  technologies,  could  also  gain  widespread  adoption  and  lead  to  issuer  transaction  fees  or  the displacement of credit card accounts as a payment method.",

This indicates that a significant portion of interchange revenue is offset by reward costs, directly impacting net revenue from these fees. Meanwhile, Mastercard's business model is heavily dependent on its issuing and acquiring partners who set interest rates, fees, and discount rates \u2014 all of which influence the competitiveness of their offerings. Because Mastercard does not directly control these pricing decisions, it is subject to the strategic choices of its partners, which can affect its market positioning and profitability. Additionally, merchants are increasingly pressuring interchange fees through litigation and regulatory scrutiny, which compounds the profitability challenges for both Capital One and Mastercard. As a result, the interplay between interchange fees, reward costs, and the structural dependency on issuing partners creates a competitive and regulatory environment that constrains profitability and necessitates strategic coordination across the payment value chain.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Capital One reports interchange fees net of $6.4 billion in customer reward expenses for 2021, directly affecting net interchange revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Mastercard does not set interest rates, fees, or discount rates, relying instead on issuing and acquiring partners for these decisions, which influence competitiveness.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The high cost of rewards reduces Capital One\u2019s interchange revenue, which is a key component of revenue for the broader payment ecosystem. Mastercard\u2019s lack of control over pricing decisions introduces additional complexity in maintaining competitive offerings and profitability, especially under increasing merchant pressure and regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees."

Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers' success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in 'Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.\n\nWith the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships  with  account  holders,  we  depend  on  our  close  working  relationships  with  our  customers  to  effectively  manage  our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Merchants' continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nMerchants  are  important  constituents  in  our  payments  system.  We  rely  on  both  our  relationships  with  them,  as  well  as  their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase  revenues  and  fight  fraud.  In  the  retail  industry,  there  is  a  set  of  larger  merchants  with  increasingly  global  scope  and influence.  We  believe  that  these  merchants  are  having  a  significant  impact  on  all  participants  in  the  global  payments  industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard  has  been  defending,  including  the  U.S.  merchant  litigations.  Some  merchants  are  increasingly  asking  regulators  to review  and  potentially  regulate  our  own  network  fees,  in  addition  to  interchange.  See  our  risk  factor  in  'Risk  Factors  -  Other Regulation' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nCertain  larger  merchants  are  also  able  to  negotiate  incentives  from  us  and  pricing  concessions  from  our  issuer  and  acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.\n\n## Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAs  we  increase  our  work  with  national,  state  and  local  governments,  both  indirectly  through  financial  institutions  and  with  them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions  in  governmental  operations,  could  impact  approved  funding  and  result  in  changes  in  the scope,  or  lead  to  the  termination,  of  the  arrangements  or  contracts  we  or  financial  institutions  enter  into  with  respect  to  our payment products and services.",

          "chunk_text": "Core Network Transactions. Our core network supports what is often referred to as a 'four-party' payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).\n\nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers,  or  establish  the  rates  charged  by  acquirers  in  connection  with  merchants'  acceptance  of  our  products.  In  most  cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\n\nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core network, and our role in that transaction:\n\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the 'merchant discount' rate), to the merchant.\n\n- Interchange Fees. Interchange  fees  reflect  the  value  merchants  receive  from  accepting  our  products  and  play  a  key  role  in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased  sales  to  their  existing  and  new  customers,  efficiencies  in  the  delivery  of  existing  and  new  products,  guaranteed payments and improved experience for the customers. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish 'default interchange fees' that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n- Additional  Four-Party  System  Fees. The  merchant  discount  rate  is  established  by  the  acquirer  to  cover  its  costs  of  both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related  fees  in  addition  to  the  merchant  discount  rate.  Issuers  may  also  charge  account  holders  fees  for  the  transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.\n\n## Switched Transactions\n\n- Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval,  facilitate  the  exchange  of  financial  transaction  information  between  issuers  and  acquirers  after  a  successfully conducted  transaction,  and  settle  the  transaction  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  funds  between  parties  via  settlement  banks chosen by us and our customers.\n- Cross-Border and Domestic. Our core network switches transactions  throughout  the  world  when  the  merchant  country  and country of issuance are different ('cross-border transactions'), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants",

      "answer": "The $3,860 million in interchange fees reported by COF in 2021 highlights the significance of this revenue stream within the payments ecosystem. MA, which depends on interchange fees as part of its business model, faces pressure from merchants seeking regulation and cost reductions on these fees. This pressure could lead to increased litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and higher incentive program costs for MA as it negotiates with large merchants. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory intervention or competitive pressures, MA\u2019s profitability could be materially and adversely affected, especially if it cannot offset these losses by increasing other revenue streams or reducing associated costs.",

MA\u2019s profitability is directly tied to the stability and competitiveness of interchange fees.

          "chunk_text": "## Our  business  significantly  depends  on  the  continued  success  and  competitiveness  of  our  issuing  and  acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.\n\nWhile we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers' success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in 'Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.\n\nWith the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships  with  account  holders,  we  depend  on  our  close  working  relationships  with  our  customers  to  effectively  manage  our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Merchants' continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nMerchants  are  important  constituents  in  our  payments  system.  We  rely  on  both  our  relationships  with  them,  as  well  as  their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase  revenues  and  fight  fraud.  In  the  retail  industry,  there  is  a  set  of  larger  merchants  with  increasingly  global  scope  and influence.  We  believe  that  these  merchants  are  having  a  significant  impact  on  all  participants  in  the  global  payments  industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard  has  been  defending,  including  the  U.S.  merchant  litigations.  Some  merchants  are  increasingly  asking  regulators  to review  and  potentially  regulate  our  own  network  fees,  in  addition  to  interchange.  See  our  risk  factor  in  'Risk  Factors  -  Other Regulation' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nCertain  larger  merchants  are  also  able  to  negotiate  incentives  from  us  and  pricing  concessions  from  our  issuer  and  acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.\n\n## Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAs  we  increase  our  work  with  national,  state  and  local  governments,  both  indirectly  through  financial  institutions  and  with  them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions  in  governmental  operations,  could  impact  approved  funding  and  result  in  changes  in  the scope,  or  lead  to  the  termination,  of  the  arrangements  or  contracts  we  or  financial  institutions  enter  into  with  respect  to  our payment products and services.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) identifies interchange fees as a key revenue source that is under pressure from regulatory caps, litigation, and merchant negotiations, such as the 2016 agreements where large merchants secured lower interchange rates. These pressures could reduce the interchange fees that acquirers pay to issuers like Capital One, which in turn affects the calculation of the merchant discount rate set by acquirers in MasterCard\u2019s (MA) four-party network. In MA\u2019s model, the merchant discount rate considers the interchange fee, which is paid by acquirers to issuers. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory or market forces, acquirers may adjust the merchant discount rate accordingly to maintain profitability, potentially altering the revenue dynamics for both acquirers and issuers within MA\u2019s network.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (COF) - Capital One notes that interchange fees are a significant source of revenue and are under pressure from regulation and merchant negotiations, including the 2016 agreements that led to lower interchange fees.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (MA) - MasterCard explains that interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers, and that the merchant discount rate is influenced by the interchange fee amount.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A reduction in interchange fees (as described by COF) would directly affect the amount acquirers pay to issuers, which would then influence how acquirers set the merchant discount rate (as described by MA), thereby altering the financial dynamics of the four-party network."

          "chunk_text": "Some of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer, or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, attain and develop more attractive co-brand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors.\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering  of  interest  rates  or  fees  that  we  might  implement  to  retain  customers,  could  reduce  our  revenues  and  therefore  our earnings. Similarly, unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\n\n## Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants' increasing focus on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees.\n\nInterchange fees are generally one of the largest components of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of credit and debit cards and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit and debit card businesses. Interchange fees are the subject  of  significant  and  intense  global  legal,  legislative  and  regulatory  focus,  and  the  resulting  decisions,  legislation  and regulation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number of countries are seeking to reduce interchange fees through legislation, competitionrelated regulatory proceedings, voluntary agreements, central bank regulation and/or litigation. For credit transactions, interchange reimbursement  rates  in  the  United  States  are  set  by  credit  card  networks  such  as  MasterCard  and  Visa.  For  debit  transactions, Federal  Reserve  rules  place  limits  on  the  interchange  fees  we  may  charge.  For  more  information  on  these  rules,  including  the Federal  Reserve's  proposed  amendments,  please  see  'Part  I-Item  1.  Business-Supervision  and  Regulation.'  In  some jurisdictions, such as Canada and certain countries in Europe, including the U.K., interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity, including in some cases, imposing caps on permissible interchange fees. Our international card businesses have been impacted by these restrictions. For example, in the U.K., interchange fees are capped for both credit and debit card transactions. In addition, in Canada, Visa and Mastercard payment networks have, since 2014, entered into voluntary agreements with the Department of Finance Canada to maintain an agreed upon average interchange rate. Lowering interchange fees remains an area of domestic and international governmental focus. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another, such as our primary market, the United States.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity, merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees. During the past few years, merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard, American Express and their card-issuing banks, claiming that their practices toward merchants, including interchange and similar fees, violate federal antitrust laws. In 2005, a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us,  alleging  among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. In December 2013, the U.S. District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  New  York  granted  final  approval  of  the  proposed  class  settlement.  The  settlement provided, among other things, that merchants would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fees. The settlement was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which rejected the settlement in June 2016; a revised settlement was reached in  the  second  half  of  2018,  and  the  trial  court  issued  its  final  approval  of  the  settlement  in  December  2019.  See  'Note  18Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others' for further details.\n\nSome major retailers may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa, which could, in turn, result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers.  In  2016,  some  of  the  largest  merchants  individually  negotiated  lower  interchange  rates  with  MasterCard  and/or  Visa. These and other merchants also continue to lobby aggressively for caps and restrictions on interchange fees and their efforts may be successful or they may in the future bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks.\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees, such as ACH-based payments, or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards. New payment systems, particularly  mobile-based  payment  technologies,  could  also  gain  widespread  adoption  and  lead  to  issuer  transaction  fees  or  the displacement of credit card accounts as a payment method.",

          "chunk_text": "Core Network Transactions. Our core network supports what is often referred to as a 'four-party' payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder's financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant's financial institution).\n\nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers,  or  establish  the  rates  charged  by  acquirers  in  connection  with  merchants'  acceptance  of  our  products.  In  most  cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\n\nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core network, and our role in that transaction:\n\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the 'merchant discount' rate), to the merchant.\n\n- Interchange Fees. Interchange  fees  reflect  the  value  merchants  receive  from  accepting  our  products  and  play  a  key  role  in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased  sales  to  their  existing  and  new  customers,  efficiencies  in  the  delivery  of  existing  and  new  products,  guaranteed payments and improved experience for the customers. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish 'default interchange fees' that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n- Additional  Four-Party  System  Fees. The  merchant  discount  rate  is  established  by  the  acquirer  to  cover  its  costs  of  both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related  fees  in  addition  to  the  merchant  discount  rate.  Issuers  may  also  charge  account  holders  fees  for  the  transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.\n\n## Switched Transactions\n\n- Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval,  facilitate  the  exchange  of  financial  transaction  information  between  issuers  and  acquirers  after  a  successfully conducted  transaction,  and  settle  the  transaction  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  funds  between  parties  via  settlement  banks chosen by us and our customers.\n- Cross-Border and Domestic. Our core network switches transactions  throughout  the  world  when  the  merchant  country  and country of issuance are different ('cross-border transactions'), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants",
