The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn 2021, other income (loss) - net was income of $2,000 million. The Company recognized a gain of $834 million in conjunction with the BodyArmor acquisition, a net gain of $695 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited ('CCA'), an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee, and a net gain of $114 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. Additionally, the Company recognized a net gain of $467 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Additionally, other income (loss) - net included income of $277 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income and dividend income of $73 million. Other income (loss) - net also included charges of $266 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States, pension plan settlement charges of $117 million related to our strategic realignment initiatives and net foreign currency exchange losses of $61 million.\n\nIn 2020, other income (loss) - net was income of $841 million. The Company recognized a gain of $902 million in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, which resulted from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in fairlife to fair value, a net gain of $148 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and a net gain of $35 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee . These gains were partially offset by an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $252 million related to CCBJHI, an equity method investee, an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $38 million related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America, an impairment charge of $26 million associated with an investment in an equity security without a readily determinable fair value and a net loss of $55 million related to economic hedging activities. The Company also recorded net charges of $25 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States and charges of $14 million for pension and other postretirement benefit plan settlements and curtailments related to the Company's strategic realignment initiatives. Other income (loss) - net also included income of $171 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income, $72 million of dividend income and net foreign currency exchange losses of $64 million.\n\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of our ownership interest in CCA and the BodyArmor and fairlife acquisitions.

As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2023 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $381 million and $317 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.",

      "answer": "Net pricing contributed $2,736 million toward MDLZ's adjusted operating income in 2023. At PEP, effective net pricing partially offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and other factors, though no specific dollar amount is provided for the net pricing benefit. Therefore, while both companies benefited from net pricing, MDLZ quantified its net pricing benefit directly, whereas PEP only described it qualitatively as a partial offset to larger declines.",

        "Step 1: From MDLZ's 2023 10-K, net pricing contributed $2,736 million to adjusted operating income (constant currency).",
        "Step 2: From PEP's 2023 10-K, effective net pricing helped offset operating profit declines caused by the Quaker Recall, commodity cost increases, and prior-year adjustments, though the dollar value of this benefit is not specified.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both, MDLZ provides a direct financial impact of net pricing, while PEP only references net pricing as a mitigating factor without quantifying its effect."

      "question": "How did the impact of effective net pricing on operating profit differ between PEP's PBNA and QFNA divisions in 2023, and what role did net pricing play in offsetting cost increases in both divisions?",
      "answer": "In PEP's QFNA division, effective net pricing partially offset a 22-percentage-point impact of product returns and charges from the Quaker Recall, 9-percentage-point higher commodity costs, and a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact from the 53rd reporting week, helping to mitigate a 19% decline in operating profit. In the PBNA division, effective net pricing offset the unfavorable impact of a prior-year gain on the Juice Transaction, impairment charges, higher commodity costs (18 percentage points), and a 2-percentage-point effect from the 53rd reporting week, although operating profit still declined by 52% due to these factors. Net pricing played a mitigating role in both divisions by partially countering significant cost and volume-related pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, extract that in QFNA, effective net pricing helped offset a 22-percentage-point impact from the Quaker Recall, 9-percentage-point higher commodity costs, and a 2-percentage-point impact from the 53rd reporting week, which collectively contributed to a 19% decline in operating profit.",
        "Step 2: Also from evidence_source_b, extract that in PBNA, effective net pricing partially offset a prior-year gain of $3.0 billion from the Juice Transaction, impairment charges of $321 million, 18-percentage-point higher commodity costs, and a 2-percentage-point impact from the 53rd reporting week, leading to a 52% decline in operating profit.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that while net pricing positively impacted both QFNA and PBNA by offsetting cost increases, its effectiveness was more pronounced in QFNA where it helped limit the operating profit decline to 19%, compared to PBNA where the operating profit still fell by 52% despite pricing efforts."

At PEP, effective net pricing helped offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs, although it was insufficient to prevent an overall 19% decline in operating profit for the QFNA segment. Thus, while net pricing positively supported margins at MDLZ, its impact at PEP was more defensive, cushioning the blow from larger negative factors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MDLZ's Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023, with higher net pricing being a key driver, despite being partially offset by higher raw material and advertising costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - In the QFNA segment at PEP, operating profit declined by 19%, with effective net pricing being one of the few positive factors offsetting the impact of the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experienced the positive impact of net pricing in 2023, but the outcomes differed: MDLZ saw a margin expansion, while PEP used pricing to mitigate losses. The contrast highlights how net pricing functioned differently depending on each company's broader financial context."

      "answer": "CL reported that its Eurasia operations accounted for 2% of consolidated net sales and 3% of consolidated operating profit in 2023, and while foreign currency volatility is a risk, the company actively manages it through pricing, sourcing strategies, and selective hedging. In contrast, PMI specifically notes that the fair value of its Russian reporting unit's assets is difficult to predict due to foreign currency volatility, indicating a more severe and potentially destabilizing impact on its Russian operations. Therefore, while both companies face risks from foreign currency volatility, CL has a more measured exposure with mitigating strategies in place, whereas PMI highlights a more uncertain and potentially destabilizing effect on its Russian assets.",

        "Step 1: From CL's 10-K, extract the 2% net sales and 3% operating profit contribution from Eurasia and their stated mitigation strategies (pricing, sourcing, hedging).",

How might analysts interpret the difference in debt valuation approaches between CL and PM in terms of financial reporting conservatism and interest expense recognition?",
      "answer": "Analysts may interpret CL's reporting, where the carrying value of long-term debt ($8,239 million) exceeds its fair value ($7,862 million), as indicative of debt issued at a premium or a decline in market interest rates, which increases the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This suggests CL's financial reporting reflects a more conservative approach by maintaining a higher carrying value on the balance sheet. In contrast, PM's fair value step-up adjustment for inventories ($146 million) and the $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized into interest expense suggest that PM's debt was initially recorded at a discount post-acquisition, leading to higher interest expense recognition over time. This indicates PM's approach reflects the impact of acquisition accounting on interest costs, which may affect earnings volatility. Therefore, the difference in valuation approaches reflects contrasting capital structure strategies and reporting conservatism, with CL showing a market-based valuation decline and PM experiencing acquisition-driven expense increases.",

For further discussion on goodwill, see Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 4').\n\nIn 2021, Altria elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value. For certain of its other reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, Altria elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. Altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. The weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10%.\n\nIn performing the 2021 discounted cash flow analysis, Altria made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. The analysis incorporated assumptions used in Altria's long-term financial forecast, which is used by Altria's management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of Altria's indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of Altria's control.\n\nAlthough Altria's discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. The following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, Altria's impairment conclusions: general economic conditions (such as continued uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic); federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile Altria's management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2021 are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4.\n\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value, and the impairment is recognized in the period identified. The factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and Altria's intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery.\n\nFollowing Share Conversion (as defined in Note 6) in the fourth quarter of 2020, Altria elected to account for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option. Under this option, any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in JUUL, which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements, are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses).",

In contrast, Altria's employee count decreased from approximately 7,100 in 2020 to 6,000 in 2021, primarily due to the sale of its wine business.

We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated leadership capabilities.\n\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities. Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success. The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies. Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, classroom and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.\n\nWe regularly conduct anonymous employee engagement surveys to seek feedback on a variety of topics, including employee satisfaction, support from leadership, corporate culture and culture of compliance. In addition, in 2021, we conducted quarterly employee surveys to gauge topics such as employee well-being in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, inclusion and workload. Survey results, including comparisons to prior results, are shared with our employees and our Board and are used to modify or enhance our human capital management programs.\n\n## Workplace Safety\n\nOur goal is for every Altria employee to have an injury-free career, which is supported by our Safety Management System ('SMS'). We strive for continuous improvement in our employee safety program through SMS infrastructure. Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rate for 2021 was 1.7% (versus 1.9% for 2020) and remains below the benchmark for companies in the U.S. Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing industry classification.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety measures aligned with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to help protect our employees, including remote work for non-manufacturing salaried employees and additional cleaning and sanitation practices. We also established a COVID-19 Task Force and a Return to Workplace team to facilitate the decision-making process as we navigated the evolving COVID-19 environment and its impacts on our employees.\n\n## Number of Employees and Labor Relations\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,000 people (a decrease from approximately 7,100 at December 31, 2020 driven by the sale of the wine business). Thirty percent of our employees were hourly manufacturing employees and members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees, as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions. We also have long-term agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration, which further demonstrates the trust-based relationship with the unions.\n\n## Supply Chain Human Capital Matters\n\nWe support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain. For example, in our domestic tobacco supply chain, we use on-farm good agricultural practices assessments to assess growers' compliance with practices related to labor management. Our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits in high-risk tobacco growing regions.\n\nMore information about efforts discussed in this section can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Reports at www.altria.com/responsibility.\n\n- Intellectual Property: Trademarks are of material importance to Altria and its operating companies, and are protected by registration or otherwise. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the portfolio of United States patents owned by Altria's businesses, as a whole, was material to Altria and its tobacco businesses. However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria's business or its tobacco businesses as of December 31, 2021. Altria's businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, knowhow, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures. Certain trade secrets are material to Altria and its tobacco businesses.\n- Government Regulations: Altria and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. For discussion of laws and regulations impacting Altria's tobacco operating companies, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment in Item 7.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as 'Superfund'), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.

For example, at the end of fiscal 2021, MO reported $190,082 million in long-term assets under ABI and $1,049 million under Other Investments.

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "answer": "PEP's annual tax rate in 2022 was 21.8%, while PG also operates under a similar tax framework but with different adjustments. PEP's rate was notably increased by a 1.9% adjustment due to the one-time mandatory transition tax from the TCJ Act, which pushed its effective rate above the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21.0%. This specific adjustment was absent in PG's tax considerations, indicating a divergence in how each company was impacted by one-time tax events.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PEP's annual tax rate in 2022 was 21.8%, which includes a 1.9% adjustment due to the one-time mandatory transition tax under the TCJ Act.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - PG mentions general tax considerations and annual tax rate determinants but does not reference a similar one-time transition tax adjustment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in adjustments, particularly PEP's inclusion of the 1.9% TCJ Act transition tax, explains why its annual tax rate (21.8%) was higher than the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21.0%, while PG's rate was not similarly affected."

(1)\n\nRepresents  future  pension  payments  to  comply  with  local  funding  requirements.  These  future  pension  payments  assume  the  Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2025 are not currently determinable. (2)\n\nPrimarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes  service  contracts  for  information  technology,  human  resources  management  and  facilities  management  activities  that  have  been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be  paid  if  the  underlying  contracts  were  canceled  prior  to  maturity.  In  such  cases,  we  generally  are  able  to  negotiate  new  contracts  or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not takeor-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. (3)\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include  revenue  recognition,  income  taxes,  certain  employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting  policies,  and  others  set  forth  in  Note  1  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are  integral  to  understanding  the  results  of  operations  and financial condition of the Company.\n\nThe  Company  has  discussed  the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product  to  customers.  Those  sales  predominantly  contain  a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single  point  in  time  when  ownership,  risks  and  rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities  and  consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale.  Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on  contractual  terms,  sales  volumes  and  historical  utilization and  redemption  rates.    The  actual  amounts  paid  may  be different from such estimates.  These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur  annual  tax  rate  is  determined  based  on  our  income, statutory tax rates and  the tax impacts  of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements  and  assumptions  regarding  the  recoverability  of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other  carryforwards,  and  our  ability  to  uphold  certain  tax positions.\n\nRealization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent  upon  generating  sufficient  taxable  income  in  the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more  likely  than  not  that  our  deferred  tax  assets,  net  of valuation allowances, will be realized.\n\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we  may  take  tax  positions  that  management  believes  are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.

      "answer": "PEP reported that sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 14% of its 2023 consolidated net revenue. This relationship connects to WMT's 10-K filing, which explicitly defines Sam's Club as one of Walmart's three reportable segments in its U.S. operations. This indicates that Sam's Club is a distinct and significant business unit within Walmart, which in turn makes it a material customer for PEP's products.",

      "answer": "Costco recognizes shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and includes them in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income at the point of shipment. Philip Morris (PM), on the other hand, treats shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract and records them in cost of sales, accruing for any costs not yet incurred at the time revenue is recognized. Therefore, both companies expense shipping and handling costs, but Costco includes them in merchandise costs while PM includes them in cost of sales, with differing timing and recognition mechanisms tied to their respective revenue models.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

These programs are ev idenced by agreements that are reflected in  the  carrying  v alue  of  the  inv entory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  a  component  of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other v endor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses,  which  are  reflected  in  merchandise  costs)  as  well  as  all  regional  and  home  office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrativ e expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is av ailable to all U.S. employees ov er the age of 18 who hav e completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information.",

Instead, PepsiCo emphasized its use of discounted cash flow models and qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets.

          "chunk_text": "Determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.\n\nDetermining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nThe Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.\n\nExcept for the Filorga skin health business, as described above, the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. The fair value of the Company's indefinite-life intangible assets other than Filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.\n\n- The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.\n- Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.",

We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to  drive  innovation  globally.  Consumer  research  is  excluded  from  research  and  development  costs  and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $752 million, $719 million and $711 million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  and  are  reported  within  selling,  general  and  administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at  least  annually,  using  either  a  qualitative  or  quantitative  approach.  We  perform  this  annual  assessment during  our  third  quarter,  or  more  frequently  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  in  the  brand  or  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\n\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  and  the  reporting  unit,  respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions  and  the  selection  of  assumptions  underlying  a  discount  rate (weighted-average  cost  of  capital)  based  on  market  data  available  at  the  time.  Significant  management judgment  is  necessary  to  estimate  the  impact  of  competitive  operating,  macroeconomic  and  other  factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash  flows. All  assumptions  used  in  our  impairment  evaluations  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost  of  capital,  are  based  on  the  best  available  market  information  and  are  consistent  with  our  internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.\n\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\n\n- Basis of Presentation - Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.\n- Income Taxes - Note 5.\n- Share-Based Compensation Note 6.",

However, Colgate-Palmolive did not specify a timeline for resolving this accrual. In contrast, PepsiCo stated that 'substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 25, 2021 is expected to be paid by the end of 2022,' providing a clear resolution timeline despite not disclosing the exact accrual amount. Therefore, while PepsiCo provided a defined timeline for restructuring payments, Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s lower accrual amount lacks a corresponding time-bound commitment, resulting in less certainty about its resolution schedule.",

      "answer": "At CL, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business led to a significant impairment charge of $204 million for the indefinite-lived trademark and $367 million for goodwill in the Filorga reporting unit as of December 31, 2021.

          "chunk_text": "Determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of royalty rates and a discount rate. Estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. In selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the Company considers recent market transactions for similar brands and products. In determining an appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. Other qualitative factors the Company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. As multiple valuation methodologies are used, the Company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.\n\nDetermining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of several factors including market share, brand history, future expansion expectations, the level of in-market support anticipated by management, legal or regulatory restrictions and the economic environment in the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nThe Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Filorga reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga skin health business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.\n\nExcept for the Filorga skin health business, as described above, the estimated fair value of the Company's reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. The fair value of the Company's indefinite-life intangible assets other than Filorga exceeds their recorded carrying value by at least 20%. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets.\n\n- The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.\n- Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.",

Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at  least  annually,  using  either  a  qualitative  or  quantitative  approach.  We  perform  this  annual  assessment during  our  third  quarter,  or  more  frequently  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  in  the  brand  or  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\n\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  and  the  reporting  unit,  respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions  and  the  selection  of  assumptions  underlying  a  discount  rate (weighted-average  cost  of  capital)  based  on  market  data  available  at  the  time.  Significant  management judgment  is  necessary  to  estimate  the  impact  of  competitive  operating,  macroeconomic  and  other  factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash  flows. All  assumptions  used  in  our  impairment  evaluations  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost  of  capital,  are  based  on  the  best  available  market  information  and  are  consistent  with  our  internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' and 'Our Business Risks.'\n\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\n\nSee Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Income Tax Expense and Accruals\n\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer  pricing  arrangements,  available  to  us  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Significant judgment is  required  in  determining  our  annual  tax  rate  and  in  evaluating  our  tax  positions.  We  establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related  interest,  in  light  of  changing  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the  progress  of  a  tax  audit,  new  tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\nAn estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results.

Initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. Substantially all initiatives under the Global Growth and Efficiency Program had been implemented as of December 31, 2019.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company adjusted the accrual balances related to certain projects approved prior to the conclusion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to reflect its revised estimate of remaining liabilities. This adjustment resulted in a reduction of $16 ($13 aftertax), of which a benefit of $3 was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $13 was recorded in Other (income) expense, net.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:\n\n",

In contrast, PM's favorable volume/mix was partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix effects, resulting in a net 9.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, primarily driven by higher HTU and device volume.

This was driven by improved product mix and volume gains.

      "question": "What is the combined total of Altria's marketing-related purchase obligations and PepsiCo's Juice Transaction proceeds, and how do these figures reflect each company's distinct use of capital in the Consumer Staples sector?",
      "answer": "Altria had $609 million of purchase obligation commitments for marketing, to be satisfied within 12 months, while PepsiCo received approximately $3.5 billion in pre-tax cash proceeds from the Juice Transaction. The combined total is $4.109 billion. Altria's marketing-related obligations indicate a near-term commitment to brand and product promotion, directly supporting its core tobacco business. In contrast, PepsiCo's Juice Transaction proceeds were positioned as a source of liquidity to fund broader capital needs, including acquisitions, debt repayments, and share repurchases, suggesting a more diversified capital deployment strategy.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria had $609 million of marketing-related purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PepsiCo reported approximately $3.5 billion in pre-tax cash proceeds from the Juice Transaction.",
        "Step 3: Combine figures - $609 million (Altria marketing obligations) + $3.5 billion (PepsiCo Juice Transaction proceeds) = $4.109 billion.",
        "Step 4: Analyze distinct capital usage - Altria's obligations are specifically for marketing within its tobacco business, while PepsiCo's proceeds are described as supporting a diverse set of financial obligations and strategic initiatives."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSte. Michelle Transaction - On October 1, 2021, UST received net cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion from the Ste. Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained  from  issuances  of  commercial  paper  and  long-term  debt,  and  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  These sources  of  cash  are  available  to  fund  cash  outflows  that  have  both  a  short-  and  long-term  component, including  debt  repayments  and  related  interest  payments;  payments  for  acquisitions,  including  support  for socioeconomic  programs  in  South  Africa  related  to  our  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Foods;  operating  leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend  payments  and  share  repurchases.  We  do  not  have  guarantees  or  off-balance  sheet  financing arrangements,  including  variable  interest  entities,  that  we  believe  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our liquidity.  See  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  'Our  Business  Risks'  and  Note  8  to  our  consolidated  financial statements for further information.\n\nOur sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 and, to date, we have not identified  any  material  liquidity  deficiencies  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Based  on  the information  currently  available  to  us,  we  do  not  expect  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to  have  a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' 'Our Business Risks' and  Note  1  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  related  to  the  impact  of  the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.\n\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\n\nAs part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally  range  from  60  to  90  days,  which  we  deem  to  be  commercially  reasonable. We  will  continue  to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo  to  these  participating  global  financial  institutions.  Supplier  participation  in  these  financing arrangements  is  voluntary.  Our  suppliers  negotiate  their  financing  agreements  directly  with  the  respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating  suppliers  to  leverage  PepsiCo's  creditworthiness  in  establishing  credit  spreads  and  associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted.

      "answer": "Altria offered financial incentives to its employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19 as part of its broader benefits package, which included mental health support and family creation assistance. This reflects a focus on internal stakeholder engagement\u2014specifically, safeguarding employee health and maintaining operational continuity during the pandemic. In contrast, PepsiCo provided financial incentives to its external stakeholders\u2014distributors, retailers, and bottlers\u2014to support product promotion and consumer engagement through volume-based rebates, product placement fees, and advertising support. These incentives were part of annual negotiations with bottlers and aimed at strengthening market presence and brand visibility.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- Customers: For a discussion of PM USA, USSTC, Helix and Middleton's largest customers, including their percentages of Altria's consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 15. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 15').\n- Executive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Information about Our Executive Officers as of February 15, 2022 of this Form 10-K.\n- Human Capital Resources: We believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision-making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing and retaining talented, diverse employees; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, advancement and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity ('ID&amp;E') programs are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development, including our ID&amp;E initiatives.\n\n## Inclusion, Diversity and Equity\n\nWe recognize the critical importance of ID&amp;E in pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion &amp; Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts:\n\n- Be an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function.\n- Have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran.\n- Have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, women represented 32% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 24% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits. Our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in November 2021, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers. Our benefits also include mental health and wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for 2020 and 2021, we expanded dependent care coverage to include $5,000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs. In addition, we offered financial incentives to our employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.",

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam's  Club  (Sam's),  represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.

These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8  billion  between  2023  and  2041  and  $2.9  billion  may  be  carried  forward  indefinitely.  We  establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n\n## Undistributed International Earnings\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future  distribution  of  these  earnings  would  not  be  subject  to  U.S.  federal  tax  expense,  no  deferred  tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state  taxes  have  been recognized.

PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\n\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.",

      "answer": "Altria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The benefit is measured as the largest amount greater than 50% likely of being realized. PepsiCo, on the other hand, focuses on internal controls and procedures to identify uncertain tax positions, involving tax professionals to evaluate the company's tax structure, transactions, and interpretations of tax law, particularly transfer pricing arrangements. PepsiCo also monitors for new information such as tax examination progress or new tax laws that could affect unrecognized tax benefits. This indicates that while Altria emphasizes a quantitative threshold (more than 50% likelihood of realization), PepsiCo emphasizes procedural rigor and continuous reassessment based on evolving legal and regulatory inputs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Altria applies a 'more likely than not' threshold and measures uncertain tax benefits based on a probabilistic threshold (>50% likelihood of realization).",

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAltria elected to account for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Altria's share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these equity investments are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The carrying value for each of Altria's equity investments in ABI and Cronos is reported in",

Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years' tax returns in light of new information.\n\nThe  following  are  the  primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter.  We evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  related  to  the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate  the  tax  law  and  tax  authority's  settlement  history  used  to  estimate  the  unrecognized  tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax  benefits,  such  as  progress  of  a  tax  examination,  new  tax  law  or  tax  authority  settlements.  We involved  tax  and  valuation  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and  knowledge,  who  assisted  in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company's tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company's interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.\n\n## /s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1990.\n\nNew York, New York February 9, 2022",

      "question": "How does the treatment of certain tax items in Altria's adjusted effective tax rate forecast compare with PepsiCo's approach to calculating its tax provision based on applicable income tax rates, and what does this reveal about their respective financial reporting strategies?",
      "answer": "Altria excludes certain tax items from its adjusted effective tax rate forecast because these items are considered unusual, infrequent, or difficult to predict, which prevents the company from providing a GAAP reconciliation for these forecasts. In contrast, PepsiCo calculates its tax provision based on the expected tax charge or benefit on each underlying item, using the applicable income tax rates in the respective tax jurisdictions. This reveals that Altria prioritizes operational transparency by filtering out non-recurring or volatile tax impacts, while PepsiCo maintains a more direct alignment with GAAP by applying tax rates consistently to all items in its provision for income taxes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Altria's adjusted effective tax rate forecast excludes certain tax items that are not part of underlying operations and are difficult to predict, making GAAP reconciliation infeasible.",

        "Step 3: Comparing both approaches reveals differing financial reporting strategies: Altria filters out volatile tax items to highlight underlying performance, whereas PepsiCo applies tax rates consistently to all items, maintaining GAAP alignment."

Altria's management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items on its reported diluted EPS or its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding GAAP measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS forecast or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWhile Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP, its management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins, net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related and disposition-related costs, COVID-19 special items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights), certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ('NPM') adjustment disputes under the MSA (such dispute resolutions are referred to as 'NPM Adjustment Items'). Altria's management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria's underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria's management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria's adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate.\n\nAltria's management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results, and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to Altria's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\n\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volumebased incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable consideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.\n\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):\n\n",

The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition  of  the  cost  related  to  our  consumer  engagement  and  trade  promotion  programs  contain  uncertainties  due  to  the  judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program. For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans As discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.\n\nWeighted-average  discount  rate  assumptions  for  pension  and  postretirement  plan  obligations  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020  are  as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do rising consumer debt levels influence the business strategies of both Costco and Altria, given their respective exposure to consumer spending and tobacco product demand?",
      "answer": "Rising consumer debt levels negatively impact Costco by potentially reducing consumer demand for its products and services, as members may cut discretionary spending due to financial pressures. This could force Costco to adjust its merchandising and pricing strategies to maintain sales and gross margin. Similarly, Altria observes that higher consumer debt levels place discretionary income pressure on adult tobacco consumers, influencing purchasing behaviors such as brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. Both companies are therefore adapting their strategies\u2014Costco by managing cost increases and maintaining competitive pricing, and Altria by monitoring consumer behavior shifts and adjusting product offerings to retain market share.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Costco notes that higher consumer debt levels could reduce demand for its products and require changes in merchandising and pricing strategies to maintain sales and margins.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Altria specifically mentions that higher consumer debt levels place discretionary income pressure on tobacco consumers, affecting their purchasing behaviors, including brand preferences and adoption of smoke-free products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are impacted by the same macroeconomic factor (consumer debt levels), but in different consumer sectors. Costco must manage pricing and product mix to retain members, while Altria must monitor and adapt to shifts in tobacco consumption patterns."

Organic sales in North America increased 0.7% in 2024. The organic sales growth was driven by the United States and Canada.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in North America in 2024 versus 2023 was due to increases in Home Care and Oral Care organic sales, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner category, partially offset by an organic sales decline in the hand dish category. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the skin health and underarm protection categories, partially offset by organic sales growth in the liquid hand soap category.\n\nOperating profit in North America decreased 4% in 2024 to $839, or 90 bps to 20.4% as a percentage of Net Sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Gross profit (60 bps), more than offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex penses (150 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (210 bps), partially offset by lower pricing and higher raw and packaging material costs (50 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased advertising investment (140 bps).",

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales also increased 5%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.6 points.\n\n- Oral Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to the positive impacts of favorable product mix (due to growth of premium paste and power brushes, which have higher than category-average selling prices) and higher pricing (driven by Latin America, Europe and North America), partially offset by a decrease in unit volume. The unit volume decrease was due to a decline in Latin America and G reater China (both due to share losses) partially offset by growth in North America and Europe (both due to market growth). Organic sales also increased mid-single digits due to a double-digit increase in Europe and a mid-single-digit increase in North America partially offset by a low single-digit decline in G reater China.

The unit volume decrease was due to declines in Latin America and IMEA (both due to market contraction including lower cough and cold incidence), partially offset by growth in North America (due to innovation).

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive defines Organic Sales Growth as net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments, and uses it alongside other financial and non-financial indicators to monitor business health and performance. In contrast, Procter & Gamble defines Organic Sales Growth similarly\u2014excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange\u2014but emphasizes its use specifically in assessing management performance for at-risk compensation. The difference lies in how each company integrates the metric into its broader performance evaluation framework: Colgate uses it as part of a comprehensive set of indicators, while P&G explicitly ties it to executive compensation decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Executive Overview\n\n## Business Organization\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' the 'Company' or 'Colgate') is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver consistent compounded earnings per share growth to help drive superior total shareholder return, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling science-led products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy across our organization.\n\nWe are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.\n\nOperationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approx imately two-thirds of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.\n\nThe Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and, in some geographies, skin health professionals. Through Hill's Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.\n\nIn connection with management changes, we realigned the reporting structure of our skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with our other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share, household penetration and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and 'Market Share Information' below.\n\n## The War in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in Ukraine and Russia, though it has not been material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no manufacturing facilities in Russia. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our business in the Eurasia region constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating profit.",

These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\n\nOrganic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\n\nThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:\n\n",

      "answer": "Costco's strategy of absorbing cost increases by reducing prices or holding them steady can intensify competitive pressures on Mondelez, which notes in its 10-K that adjusting pricing without maintaining or increasing sales volumes could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco's pricing strategy includes reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases, which negatively impacts gross margin in the near term.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mondelez states that if it adjusts pricing but cannot maintain or increase sales volumes, or if its labor or other costs increase but it cannot increase prices to offset those changes, its financial condition and results of operations will suffer.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Costco's pricing strategy to remain competitive by absorbing cost increases and driving sales volume puts pressure on Mondelez to also manage pricing carefully. Mondelez's concern about adjusting pricing without maintaining or increasing sales aligns with the competitive environment shaped by companies like Costco, which can negatively impact Mondelez's ability to sustain profitability."

      "question": "How does Costco's competitive presence in the U.S. warehouse club segment, specifically against Sam's Club, influence Mondel\u0113z's trade promotion strategies when supplying club stores like Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale?",
      "answer": "Costco directly competes with Sam's Club in the U.S. warehouse club segment, creating a highly competitive environment where club stores seek cost-effective and differentiated merchandise to attract members. Mondel\u0113z, which sells to club stores including Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale, responds by investing heavily in trade promotions to support price features, displays, and other merchandising efforts. These trade promotions are a core part of Mondel\u0113z's competitive strategy to ensure strong placement and visibility in club stores, which are themselves competing for consumer spending in a crowded retail landscape that includes Costco.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco competes with Sam's Club in the U.S. warehouse club segment, which is a key channel for reaching high-volume consumers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mondel\u0113z sells to club stores like Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale and explicitly states that it uses trade promotions to support price features and displays in stores.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Because Costco competes directly with Sam's Club, club stores like Sam's must differentiate themselves through product offerings and pricing, which in turn drives Mondel\u0113z to increase trade promotions to maintain favorable in-store positioning and pricing support."

      "answer": "MDLZ experienced a $1,121 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022, driven by one-time factors such as the European Commission legal matter, acquisition-related costs, and war in Ukraine-related expenses. This, along with higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency changes, contributed to a decline in operating income margin from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. Meanwhile, COST noted that inflationary pressures on merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses could adversely affect its operations and financial results, particularly if it could not pass these costs to consumers without negatively impacting demand. The combination of these pressures in the consumer staples sector highlights how both companies faced margin compression due to rising input and operational costs, with MDLZ's situation exacerbated by extraordinary events.",

The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information.",

In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) attributes a 4% increase in net sales growth specifically to price changes across its product categories, indicating a strategic reliance on pricing power to drive revenue. This comparison reveals that while both companies are influenced by pricing dynamics, COST's pricing sensitivity is tied to volume and external market forces (like fuel prices), whereas PG actively leverages pricing strategy as a lever to influence sales growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe believe our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses;  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin  percentage  and  lower  SG&amp;A  expense relativ e  to  our  non-gasoline  businesses.  A  higher  penetration  of  gasoline  sales  will  generally  lower  our  gross  margin  percentage.  Generally,  rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, giv en the higher sales base, negativ ely impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inv erse effect.\n\nGovernment actions in v arious countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, hav e affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on  (among  other  things)  the  type  of  goods,  rates  imposed,  and  timing  of  the  tariffs.  Higher  tariffs  could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparativ ely less substantial component of growth. Negativ e aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relativ e to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our ecommerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin percentage than our warehouse operations.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. T his format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and prov ide continuing fee rev enue. T he extent to which we achiev e growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executiv e memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adv ersely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adv ersely impacted by lower renewal rates in newer markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heav ily on controlling costs. While we believ e that we hav e achiev ed successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believ e that achiev ing our longer-term objectiv es of reducing employee turnov er, increasing productiv ity  and  enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation lev els that are better than the industry av erage for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on v ery low margins, modest changes in v arious items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&amp;A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment hav e relativ ely higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business deliv ery.\n\nIn  discussions  of  our  consolidated  operating  results,  we  refer  to  the  impact  of  changes  in  foreign  currencies  relativ e  to  the  U.S.  dollar ,  which  are differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to conv ert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into  U.S. dollars.  T his  impact is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices  on  net  sales  is  calculated  based  on  the  difference  between  the  current  and  prior  period's  av erage  price  per  gallon  sold.  Results  expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be rev iewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",

      "answer": "PM discloses specific figures regarding equity compensation, including 4,542,654 shares of common stock that may be issued upon vesting of restricted share units and 2,700,320 shares tied to performance share units contingent on achieving maximum performance targets. In contrast, TGT does not provide direct disclosure on equity compensation vesting conditions but instead incorporates by reference sections of its Proxy Statement, such as 'Stock ownership information' and 'Compensation tables-Equity compensation plan information,' without revealing concrete numbers or vesting criteria. This contrast implies that PM offers greater transparency in its executive incentive framework, while TGT's reliance on referenced materials obscures the specifics of its equity compensation structure, potentially limiting visibility into how executive incentives are tied to performance metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From PM's 10-K, extract the specific equity compensation figures: 4,542,654 restricted share units and 2,700,320 performance share units contingent on performance targets.",

        "Step 4: Conclude that PM's disclosure provides clearer insight into executive incentives, whereas TGT's approach offers less immediate transparency."

This indicates that KO\u2019s total operating expenses include both repair and maintenance costs as well as significant depreciation expenses, while COST only discloses the treatment of such costs without specific dollar amounts.

While both companies use similar methodologies, COST emphasizes the achievement of long-service terms for accelerated vesting and recognizes compensation expense upon such achievement, whereas KO forfeits awards upon termination except under specific circumstances. This means COST may recognize expense earlier for long-serving employees, while KO's expense timing is strictly tied to the vesting schedule.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COST's disclosure, extract the fair value calculation method for RSUs: 'market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period' and the accelerated vesting upon achievement of long-service terms.",
        "Step 2: From KO's disclosure, extract their RSU fair value calculation: 'closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period' and the forfeiture policy upon termination.",
        "Step 3: Compare the methodologies and note that both use a similar fair value approach but differ in vesting and forfeiture conditions, which affects the timing of expense recognition.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize that while the core fair value calculation is similar, the differences in vesting triggers (especially for long service at COST) and forfeiture policies mean that COST may recognize expense earlier in some cases, while KO's recognition is more strictly tied to the vesting schedule."

      "answer": "Costco reports that its stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, with certain costs also capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reports a stock-based compensation expense of $233 million in 2023, which is captured under Capital Surplus as part of its equity structure. This reveals that Costco integrates stock-based compensation directly into its operational cost structure, while Coca-Cola reflects it as part of its capital account adjustments, highlighting differences in how the two companies account for and disclose equity-based compensation.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Costco's stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses, with certain costs capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise.",

In contrast, MDLZ reports its short-term lease cost for 2023 as $12 million.

      "question": "How does Colgate-Palmolive's approach to evaluating indefinite-life intangible assets, particularly regarding discount rates and cash flow projections, contrast with Mondelez's 2023 impairment charges for its chocolate and biscuit brands, and what does this reveal about sector-specific risks in the consumer staples industry?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive evaluates indefinite-life intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative analysis, with discount rates derived from high-quality bond yield curves and cash flow projections based on long-term return expectations. Mondelez, on the other hand, applied a market-based weighted-average cost of capital of 7.1% for Europe and North America and a risk-rated rate of 10.1% for Latin America and AMEA, leading to $26 million in impairment charges for a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. This contrast reveals that while both companies use similar valuation methodologies involving discount rates and cash flow projections, Mondelez's specific exposure to food brands\u2014particularly chocolate and biscuits\u2014resulted in actual impairments, highlighting higher sector-specific risks in the food category within the broader consumer staples industry.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive evaluates indefinite-life intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative analysis, with discount rates based on high-quality bond yield curves and long-term return expectations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mondelez used a market-based weighted-average cost of capital of 7.1% for Europe and North America and a risk-rated rate of 10.1% for Latin America and AMEA, leading to $26 million in impairment charges for a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The methodologies are aligned in principle (discount rates, cash flow projections), but the outcomes differ: Colgate-Palmolive did not report impairments, while Mondelez recorded specific impairments in the food category, indicating higher risk in that subsector."

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive performs annual impairment tests on indefinite-life intangible assets, such as global brands, using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Mondelez, on the other hand, reported a significantly large balance of $18.7 billion in indefinite-life intangible assets as of December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of brand names, and conducts quantitative impairment testing by comparing estimated fair value to carrying value using valuation methods like relief from royalty, excess earnings, and excess margin. The scale of Mondelez's intangible assets and the detailed audit scrutiny they undergo, including the use of specialized professionals, indicates a more complex and resource-intensive impairment assessment process compared to Colgate-Palmolive's approach.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive performs either a qualitative or quantitative analysis for impairment testing of indefinite-life intangible assets.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) performs either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test for indefinite-life intangible assets such as global brands, without specifying detailed valuation techniques. In contrast, Mondelez International (MDLZ) explicitly outlines the use of relief from royalty, excess earnings, and excess margin methods during quantitative testing. These techniques involve estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates to determine the global fair value of a brand. CL does not explicitly reference these specific valuation methodologies in its impairment testing approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Colgate-Palmolive discloses that goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when events indicate potential impairment, using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis, but does not specify the valuation methods.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Mondelez International describes using specific valuation methods \u2014 relief from royalty, excess earnings, and excess margin \u2014 during quantitative impairment testing of indefinite-life intangible assets.",

      "question": "What was the 2023 AOCL impact for KO and MO from changes in the carrying value of foreign currency denominated debt, and how does this volatility influence their capital structure planning?",
      "answer": "KO disclosed that changes in the carrying value of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI. MO recognized changes in the carrying value of foreign currency denominated debt due to Euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate movements in accumulated other comprehensive losses. These AOCL fluctuations directly impact the companies' equity structure and require strategic capital planning, such as using hedges to mitigate volatility and stabilize reported equity. KO preserves hedging relationships under SOFR transitions, while MO amortizes gains from excluded components into interest and debt expense, both aligning capital decisions with AOCL management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's disclosure, changes in the carrying value of foreign currency debt due to exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in AOCI under net foreign currency translation adjustments.",
        "Step 2: MO specifically recognized AOCL impacts from foreign currency debt related to ABI due to Euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate changes, with gains amortized into interest and debt expense.",
        "Step 3: Both companies explicitly link AOCL volatility from foreign exchange to capital structure considerations, with KO preserving hedging relationships and MO adjusting interest expense based on hedge effectiveness.",
        "Step 4: Therefore, the AOCL impact from foreign currency debt changes influences how KO and MO manage capital structure through hedging and amortization strategies."

Meanwhile, MO recognized a pre-tax gain of $(7) million on foreign currency contracts for the year ended December 31, 2021, with changes in the fair value of these contracts and the carrying value of foreign currency denominated debt due to the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate being recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

COST also recognizes membership fee revenue ratably over one year, aligning with WMT's approach.

Renewal  rates  benefited  from  higher  penetration  of  Executiv e  members.

          "chunk_text": "## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nNoncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in ex cess of par. The Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027, with annual options thereafter.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or provides services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Financial, Advertising and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Membership and Other Income\n\nMembership and other income primarily includes membership fee revenue associated with the Company's various membership offerings for customers and members across each reportable segment. Membership fee revenue is recognized over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2024 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, membership and other income includes items such as rental and tenant income, recycling income and gift card breakage income.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card, thus a liability for deferred gift card revenue is recorded within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5. G ift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes gift card breakage income for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes costs of merchandise sold and services performed; costs of transporting merchandise to the Company's distribution facilities, stores, clubs, and customers; and also includes warehousing costs for the Sam's Club U.S. segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments, except in certain situations as described below.\n\n## Payments from Suppliers\n\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in situations when the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service or a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.",

      "question": "How does the difference in accounting treatment for membership fee revenue between Costco and Walmart affect the presentation of deferred revenue on their respective balance sheets in 2024, and what are the specific deferred amounts reported by each company?",
      "answer": "Costco accounts for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognizing it ratably over the one-year membership period. As a result, deferred membership fees are reported as a liability on the balance sheet, with a specific amount of $2,501 million in 2024. In contrast, Walmart also recognizes membership fee revenue over the 12-month membership term but reports deferred membership fee revenue as part of accrued liabilities, with a total membership fee revenue of $3.1 billion in fiscal 2024. While both companies defer the recognition of membership fee revenue to match it with the service period, Costco presents the deferred amount as a separate liability, whereas Walmart includes it within accrued liabilities. This difference in presentation reflects each company\u2019s internal classification approach, even though the underlying revenue recognition timing is similar.",

These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to gov ernment agencies and member returns. The Company reserv es for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recov ery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectiv ely, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods.  The  Company also prov ides  expanded  products  and  serv ices  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  T he  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its transactions and recognizes rev enue on a gross basis.  The  Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or serv ice before it is transferred to the member. The majority of rev enue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Rev enue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, rev enue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  rev enue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  ov er  the  one-year  membership  period.  Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executiv e members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum v alue, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of nonredemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the net reduction in sales was $2,804, $2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise prov ides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card  liabilities  are  included  in  other  current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusiv e issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receiv es v arious forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receiv e, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inv entory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company's depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by v endor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.",

The Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027, with annual options thereafter.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or provides services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Financial, Advertising and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Membership and Other Income\n\nMembership and other income primarily includes membership fee revenue associated with the Company's various membership offerings for customers and members across each reportable segment. Membership fee revenue is recognized over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2024 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, membership and other income includes items such as rental and tenant income, recycling income and gift card breakage income.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card, thus a liability for deferred gift card revenue is recorded within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5. G ift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes gift card breakage income for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes costs of merchandise sold and services performed; costs of transporting merchandise to the Company's distribution facilities, stores, clubs, and customers; and also includes warehousing costs for the Sam's Club U.S. segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments, except in certain situations as described below.\n\n## Payments from Suppliers\n\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in situations when the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service or a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nNoncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in ex cess of par. The Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027, with annual options thereafter.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or provides services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Financial, Advertising and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Membership and Other Income\n\nMembership and other income primarily includes membership fee revenue associated with the Company's various membership offerings for customers and members across each reportable segment. Membership fee revenue is recognized over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2024 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, membership and other income includes items such as rental and tenant income, recycling income and gift card breakage income.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card, thus a liability for deferred gift card revenue is recorded within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5. G ift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes gift card breakage income for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes costs of merchandise sold and services performed; costs of transporting merchandise to the Company's distribution facilities, stores, clubs, and customers; and also includes warehousing costs for the Sam's Club U.S. segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments, except in certain situations as described below.\n\n## Payments from Suppliers\n\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in situations when the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service or a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.",

      "answer": "Walmart's operation of 5,566 stores across 18 countries, including formats like supercenters and warehouse clubs, combined with its omni-channel integration (pickup and delivery services in most markets, same-day delivery, and digital platforms like walmart.com.mx and walmart.ca), enhances its global competitive reach. Walmart leverages its global ecosystem and local expertise to offer affordable products and services, while also expanding into digital payments through platforms like PhonePe. This creates a competitive challenge for Costco, which acknowledges the risk of losing market share to retailers with greater financial resources and technology capabilities, such as Walmart. Walmart's broader international footprint, coupled with its investments in digital infrastructure and economies of scale, could allow it to outpace Costco in attracting global customers and members, thereby directly impacting Costco's ability to maintain its competitive position.",

Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negativ ely impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core v alues. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prev ailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and inv est significant resources in training and motiv ating them. T here is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims for  employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures arising from v ery large losses.

          "chunk_text": "## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, warehouse clubs (including our membership-only Sam's Club format) and cash and carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.9 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 18% of our fiscal 2025 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $114.6 billion and $101.0 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to bring Walmart to the world and the world to Walmart, which means we help millions of customers and members save money and live better every day by leveraging our global ecosystem and deep local expertise to provide access to affordable products and services. In addition, we share what we learn in our markets to help the enterprise innovate and grow even faster. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to reshape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.\n- Sold our equity investment in JD.com in August 2024.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides a convenient and seamless omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through our pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, including same-day delivery. We continue to expand our marketplace offerings, which also further unlocks fulfillment and advertising services.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2025, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise and Other Offerings. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera\" and \"Lider.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, financial services and healthcare. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service enhancing customer experiences through digital connectivity.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 184 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mex ico and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2025, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.",

In contrast, MDLZ saw a recovery in its 'world travel business' as global travel improved, contributing to an 8.0% net revenue increase in 2021, although this segment remained below pre-pandemic levels.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark and goodwill and, accordingly, performed an interim impairment test for the trademark as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark exceeded its estimated fair value, and recorded an impairment charge of $204, reducing the carrying value to approximately $588. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $367 in the Filorga reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to approximately $577.

Overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, sales of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.\n\nOrganic Net Revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix in Europe, AMEA and Latin America was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in North America as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. Favorable currency impacts",

In contrast, Target explicitly states it offers a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members as part of a broader compensation package that includes benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and education assistance.

We are among the largest private employers in the United States (U.S.), and our workforce has varying goals and expectations of their employment relationship, from team members looking to build a career to students, retirees and others who are seeking to supplement their income in an enjoyable atmosphere. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and  retain  top  talent  no  matter  their  objectives  in  seeking  employment.  To  that  end,  we  strive  to  foster  an  engaged,  diverse, inclusive, safe, purpose-driven culture where employees, referred to as \"team members,\" have equitable opportunities for success.\n\nAs of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 450,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal team members. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, employment levels peak in the holiday season. We also engage independent contractors, most notably in our Shipt subsidiary.\n\nOur  Board  of  Directors,  through  the  Compensation  and  Human  Capital  Management  Committee,  oversees  human  capital management matters.\n\n## Talent Development and Engagement\n\nWe offer a compelling work environment with meaningful experiences and abundant growth and career-development opportunities. This  starts  with  the  opportunity  to  do  challenging  work  and  learn  on  the  job  and  is  supplemented  by  programs  and  continuous learning  that  help  our  team  build  skills  at  all  levels,  including  programs  focused  on  specialized  skill  development,  leadership opportunities, coaching, and mentoring. Our talent and succession planning process supports the development of a diverse talent pipeline for leadership and other critical roles.

We champion workplace diversity and an  inclusive  work  environment  with  a  focus  on  attracting,  engaging,  developing  and  advancing  diverse  talent.  We  monitor  the representation of women and racially or ethnically diverse team members at different levels throughout the company and disclose the composition of our team in our annual Workforce Diversity Report (which includes demographic information using the categories disclosed in our EEO-1 report). Developing teams where team members feel heard, respected, and included is a core Target value and is fundamental to creating an inclusive guest experience.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. We believe in paying team members equitably, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and we regularly review the pay data of U.S. team members to confirm that we are doing so. Our compensation packages include a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members (who comprise the vast majority of our team), a 401(k) plan with matching contributions up to five percent of eligible earnings, paid vacation and holidays, family leave, merchandise and other discounts, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare and dependent care flexible spending accounts, debt-free education assistance and tuition reimbursement, free  mental  health  services,  an  annual  short-term  incentive  program,  long-term  equity  awards,  and  health  insurance  benefits, including free virtual health care visits.

These  attributes contribute  to  what  we  consider,  especially  for  the  industry,  a  high  retention  rate.  In  2022,  in  the  U.S.  that  rate  was approximately 90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nThe  commitment  to  'Take  Care  of  Our  Employees'  is  also  the  foundation  of  our  approach  to  diversity,  equity  and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2022, we appointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Embracing differences is important to the growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business.\n\n## Well Being\n\nIn October 2021, we provided an increase of a minimum of $0.50 per hour for U.S. and Canada wage scales. In March 2022, we provided certain compensation increases, including a $0.75 per hour increase to the top of the U.S. wage scales, increased the starting wage to $17.50, and granted our employees one additional day of paid time off. In July 2022,  we  provided  an  additional  increase  to  the  top  of  the  U.S.  wage  scales  of  $0.50  per  hour.

      "answer": "Costco's merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increased from 89.2% in 2021 to 89.5% in 2022, contributing to a decline in its gross margin percentage from 11.13% to 10.48%. In contrast, Target reported that higher merchandise costs were a factor negatively impacting its gross margin percentage in 2021, even though it maintained a much higher gross margin at 28.3%. This shows that while both companies faced pressure from merchandise cost increases, Costco experienced a direct decline in gross margin percentage, whereas Target was able to offset some of the cost pressures through other factors like digital fulfillment efficiencies and favorable category mix.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Costco's 2022 10-K, merchandise costs were $199,382 million in 2022 and $170,684 million in 2021, with net sales of $222,730 million and $192,052 million respectively. This results in merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increasing from 89.2% to 89.5%.",
        "Step 2: The increase in merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales directly contributed to Costco's gross margin percentage declining from 11.13% in 2021 to 10.48% in 2022.",

      "answer": "To evaluate the segment cost of sales reporting transparency and cost components of MDLZ and PEP, we begin with MDLZ's 2024 10-K filing, which explicitly reports segment cost of sales for Latin America at $3,230 million and North America at $6,491 million. These figures represent the direct costs associated with production and distribution in those regions. In contrast, PEP's 10-K provides a more granular definition of segment cost of sales, explicitly listing components such as raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, production planning, inspection costs, and raw materials handling facilities. PEP also clarifies that these costs exclude the impact of comparability items, which are managed centrally and reported in corporate unallocated expenses. By comparing these disclosures, it becomes evident that while MDLZ offers precise dollar amounts per region, PEP provides a more detailed breakdown of cost components, enhancing operational transparency. This contrast suggests that PEP's approach offers deeper insight into the structure of production costs, while MDLZ's reporting emphasizes geographic cost allocation.",

The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any im pact of changes in our assum ptions during the year which reflect m arket conditions over which division m anagem ent has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical Expense\n\nPension and retiree m edical service costs m easured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determ ine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These com m odity derivatives include agricultural products, m etals, and energy . Com m odity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatm ent are m arked to m arket each period with the resulting gains and l osses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  adm inistrative  expenses,  depending  on  the underlying com m odity . These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the econom ic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting m ark-tomarket volatility , which rem ains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying com m odity price risk and were not entered i n to f or tradi n g  or specul ati v e pu rposes.\n\n## Net Revenue, Significant Expenses and Operating Profit/(Loss) by Division\n\nOur chief operating decision m aker (CODM) is our Chairm an and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses division operating profit/(loss) as the profit m easure to evaluate division perform ance and allocate resources across divisions. Corporate unallocated expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/incom e and net interest expense and other are centrally m anaged costs and are therefore excluded from  this profit measure to provide better transparency of our division operating results. Our CODM considers variances of actual perform ance to our annual operating plan and periodic forecasts when m aking decisions.\n\nSignificant expenses are expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and are included in division operating profit/(loss). These consist of segment  cost  of  sales,  segm ent  selling,  general  and  adm inistrative  expenses,  and  various  item s  affecting  com parability .  Segm ent  cost  of  sales i n cl u des raw m ateri al s, di rect l abor and pl ant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, i n specti on  costs  and  raw  m aterials  handling  faciliti es,  excl udi ng  the  i m pact  of  i tem s  aff ecti ng  com parabi l i ty .  Segm ent  sel l i ng,  general   and administrative expenses include the costs to execute sales to custom ers, distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain m erchandising activities, costs related to brand and product m arketing to consum ers, other ongoing operating costs that are not directly related to m anufacturing, distribution, selling, advertising or m arketing activities as well as other incom e or expense item s, excluding the i m pact  of   i tem s  af f ecti n g   com parabi l i ty .

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nMondel\u0113z International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondel\u0113z International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectiv ely 'Mondel\u0113z International,' 'we,' 'us' and 'our'), sells food and bev erage products to consumers in ov er 150 countries.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, except our Venezuelan subsidiaries  that  were  deconsolidated  in  2015. All  intercompany  transactions  are  eliminated.  T he  noncontrolling  interest  represents  the noncontrolling inv estors' interests in the results of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate.  We account for inv estments ov er which we exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Inv estments ov er which we do not hav e significant influence or control are not material and as there is no readily determinable fair v alue for the equity interests, these inv estments are carried at cost with changes in the inv estment recognized to the extent cash is receiv ed.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP'), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include v aluation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful liv es of long-liv ed assets, restructuring program liabilities, contingent consideration, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserv es, pension and benefit plan assumptions and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, expectations of future impacts and other assumptions that we believ e are reasonable. Giv en the uncertainty of the  global  economic  env ironment,  our  estimates  could  be  significantly  different  than  future  performance.  If  actual  amounts  differ  from  estimates,  we include the updates in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Russia began a military inv asion of Ukraine and we closed our operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, our two Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in T rostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. During the first quarter of 2022, we ev aluated and impaired these and other related assets. We recorded $143 million of total expenses ($145 million after-tax) incurred as a direct result of the war. We rev ersed $22 million during the remainder of 2022 of prev iously recorded charges primarily as a result of higher than expected collection of trade receiv ables and inv entory recoveries. In the second quarter of 2024, we fully resumed production at both facilities after completing targeted repairs. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries and continue to ev aluate our ability to control our operating activ ities and businesses on an ongoing basis. We continue to ev aluate the uncertainty of the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economic env ironment, and we cannot predict if it will hav e a significant impact in the future.\n\n## Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting\n\nWe translate  the  results  of  operations  of  our  subsidiaries  from  multiple  currencies  using  av erage  exchange  rates  during  each  period  and  translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.\n\nHighly inflationary accounting is triggered when a country's three-year cumulativ e inflation rate exceeds 100%. It requires the remeasurement of financial statements  of  subsidiaries  in  the  country,  from  the  functional  currency  of  the  subsidiary  to  our  U.S.  dollar  reporting  currency,  with  currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily based on published estimates indicating three-year cumulativ e inflation rates exceeding 100% for Egypt and Nigeria,  we  concluded  that  both  countries  became  highly  inflationary  economies  for  accounting  purposes.  We  began  to  apply  highly  inflationary accounting for our subsidiaries operating in  Egypt and  Nigeria and changed their functional currencies from the  Egyptian  Pound and  Nigerian  Naira, respectiv ely, to the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter of 2024.",

In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity m ethod based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their econom ic resources. W e do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or l ess. Intercom pany balances and transactions are elim inated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our V enezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our V enezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.\n\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales.

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance. We hav e detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below . The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and div estiture activ ities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activ ities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activ ities and other major items affecting comparability of operating  results.  We  believ e  the  nonGAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We hav e prov ided the reconciliations between the GAAP  and  non-GAAP  financial  measures  along  with  a  discussion  of  our  underlying  GAAP  results  throughout  our Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we ev aluate our current and prior year operating results. As new ev ents or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we prov ide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Rev enue' is defined as net rev enues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, div estitures , short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business , and currency rate fluctuations . We believ e that Organic net rev enue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activ ities of our business and prov ides improv ed comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Rev enue growth from emerging markets and dev eloped markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above. (2) (3) (4)\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slov ak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our  dev eloped  markets  include  the  entire  North  America  region,  the  Europe  region  excluding  the  countries  included  in  the  emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n- 'Adjusted Operating Income' is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify  to  Grow  Program ;  gains  or  losses  (including  non-cash  impairment  charges)  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets;  div estiture or acquisition  gains  or  losses,  div estiture-related  costs , acquisition-related costs ,  and  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent consideration adjustments ;  inv entory step-up charges ; the operating results of div estitures ; operating results from short-term distributor agreements  related  to  the  sale  of  a  business ;  remeasurement  of  net  monetary  position ;  mark-to-market  impacts  from  commodity, forecasted currency and equity method inv estment transaction deriv ativ e contracts ; impact from resolution of tax matters ; 2017 malware incident net recov eries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine ; impact from the European Commission legal matter ; the impact from pension participation changes ; and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program . We also present 'Adjusted Operating Income margin,' which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also ev aluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis . We believ e these measures prov ide improv ed comparability of underlying operating results. (5) (2) (6) (7) (8) (9) (2) (3) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (4)\n- 'Adjusted  EPS'  is  defined  as  diluted  EPS  attributable  to  Mondel\u0113z  International  (the  most  comparable  U.S.  GAAP  financial  measure)  from continuing  operations  excluding  the  impacts  of  the  items  listed  in  the  Adjusted  Operating  Income  definition  as  well  as  losses  on  debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes ; and gains or losses on equity method inv estment transactions .

Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix reflected v olume declines due to the impact from customer price negotiation disruptions primarily in the second quarter, partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was driv en by declines in chocolate, biscuits &amp; baked snacks, refreshment bev erages, candy and gum, partially offset by a gain in cheese &amp; grocery. The impact of our 2023 div estiture of the dev eloped market gum business resulted in a year-ov er-year reduction in net rev enues of $174 million. Unfav orable currency translation rate changes reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies across the region, including the Turkish lira, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryv nya, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty and euro.\n\nSegment  operating  income  increased  $90  million  (4.6%),  primarily  due  to  higher  net  pricing,  lower  div estiture-related  costs,  lower  impact  from  the European Commission legal matter, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and lower remeasurement  loss  on  net  monetary  position.  These  fav orable  items  were  partially  offset  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  higher  intangible  asset impairment charges, higher adv ertising and consumer promotion costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, unfav orable v olume/mix, unfav orable currency translation rate changes, higher other selling, general and administrativ e expenses, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and higher fixed asset impairment costs.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nNet  rev enues  increased  $1,437  million  (12.6%),  due  to  higher  net  pricing  (13.8  pp),  fav orable  v olume/mix  (0.7  pp)  and  the  impact  from  short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfav orable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of div estitures (0.2 pp). Higher net pricing, driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Ov erall, v olume/mix was fav orable driv en by improv ed product mix. Fav orable v olume/mix was driv en by gains in biscuits &amp; baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment bev erages, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our dev eloped market gum business added incremental net rev enues of $22 million.  Unfav orable  currency  impacts  reflected  the  strength  of  the  U.S.  dollar  relativ e  to  sev eral  currencies  across  the  region,  including  the  Russian ruble, T urkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryv nya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of sev eral currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc. T he impact of div estitures reflected a year-ov er-year decline in net rev enues of $4 million from our 2023 div ested dev eloped market gum business.\n\nSegment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and fav orable v olume/mix.

MDLZ, on the other hand, reported that unfavorable currency translation decreased its net revenues by $1,096 million, with the Argentinean peso cited as a primary contributor.

      "answer": "The average retail square feet per store for TGT in 2023 was approximately 125,500 sq. ft. (244,584 thousand sq. ft. / 1,948 stores), while for WMT it was approximately 99,400 sq. ft. (1,056 million sq. ft. / 10,623 stores). This results in a difference of approximately 26,100 sq. ft. per store. TGT's 10-K filing shows a focus on larger-format stores, with 274 stores over 170,000 sq. ft., emphasizing in-store experience and service offerings. WMT's filing highlights a higher number of smaller-format stores and a focus on neighborhood accessibility, which aligns with their strategy to optimize real estate investment and improve operational efficiency through localized store operations.",

      "question": "What is the total amount of proceeds from disposal of property and equipment for both TGT and WMT in 2023, and how does this combined amount compare to WMT's proceeds from disposal of certain operations in the same year?",
      "answer": "The total proceeds from disposal of property and equipment for TGT in 2023 was $24 million, and for WMT it was $170 million, making the combined total $194 million. This combined amount is less than WMT's proceeds from disposal of certain operations, which was $716 million in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - TGT's proceeds from disposal of property and equipment in 2023 was $24 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - WMT's proceeds from disposal of property and equipment in 2023 was $170 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined total of TGT and WMT's proceeds from disposal of property and equipment: $24 million + $170 million = $194 million.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source B - WMT's proceeds from disposal of certain operations in 2023 was $716 million.",
        "Step 5: Compare the combined total of $194 million to WMT's proceeds from disposal of certain operations of $716 million."

      "answer": "The difference in total retail square feet between TGT and WMT in their most recent fiscal years is 453,061 million square feet. TGT operated 245,939 million square feet as of February 3, 2024, while WMT reported 699 million square feet as of January 31, 2024. This large disparity indicates that WMT maintains a significantly larger retail footprint, but TGT has increased its retail square feet slightly from 244,584 million to 245,939 million, whereas WMT has reduced its retail square feet from 702 million in the prior year to 699 million, suggesting contrasting strategies in store expansion or contraction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - TGT's total retail square feet as of February 3, 2024, is 245,939 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - WMT's retail square feet as of January 31, 2024, is 699 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - 245,939 million (TGT) - 699 million (WMT) = 453,061 million square feet difference.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced structural refranchising activities in Asia Pacific during 2024, including the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, and in territories in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines in early 2024. These refranchisings were included as structural changes in the analysis of net operating revenues and impacted the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. KO distinguishes between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume, noting that structural changes typically do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales of Company beverage products regardless of ownership interest in the bottling partner. In contrast, Altria (MO) incorporates volume growth rates as a key assumption in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the NJOY transaction, particularly for future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category. MO used an income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses based on volume growth projections and operating margins, and amortizes these intangible assets over approximately 18 years. This reflects a forward-looking financial valuation approach, whereas KO\u2019s use of volume growth is operational and tied to current structural changes.",

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

We determined the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets using an income approach. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, such as discounted cash flow analyses, and thus were classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We amortize these intangible assets over a weighted-average period of approximately 18 years.\n\n## Note 4. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nWe disaggregate net revenues based on product type. For further discussion, see Note 17. Segment Reporting .\n\nPrior to 2024, substantially all cash discounts, offered in contracts with our customers for prompt payment, were based on a flat rate per unit based on agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024 for PM USA and USSTC, cash discounts in contracts with our customers were based on a percentage of the list price based on agreed-upon payment terms.

      "question": "Considering the impact of increased energy costs on both Coca-Cola (KO) and Walmart (WMT) in 2024, and given that KO reported intensified inflation affecting its operations and WMT noted increased costs of electricity and petroleum products, by how much would the combined inflation-adjusted energy cost increase for both companies be if KO experienced a 12% rise in energy costs on a $2.5 billion energy budget and WMT saw a 9% increase on a $3 billion energy expenditure?",
      "answer": "The combined inflation-adjusted energy cost increase for Coca-Cola and Walmart in 2024 would be $570 million. KO\u2019s energy cost increase would be $300 million (12% of $2.5 billion), and WMT\u2019s increase would be $270 million (9% of $3 billion), totaling $570 million.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - KO experienced intensified inflation in 2024 and reported increased energy costs, which directly impacted operations. A 12% increase on a $2.5 billion energy budget results in an additional $300 million in energy costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - WMT noted increased costs of electricity and petroleum products in 2024. A 9% increase on a $3 billion energy expenditure results in an additional $270 million in energy costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - To determine the total energy cost impact for both companies, the individual increases are calculated and summed: $300 million (KO) + $270 million (WMT) = $570 million."

The information on the Company's website is not incorporated by reference in this report. We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ('Exchange Act'). These include our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, we routinely post on the 'Investors' page of our website news releases, announcements and other statements about our business and results of operations. We may use the 'Investors' page of our website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and to comply with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, we encourage investors to monitor the 'Investors' page of our website and review the information we post on that page.\n\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at the following address: http://www.sec.gov.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\n\n## Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules and approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, and certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2024, which may continue in 2025. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In addition, the occurrence of global or regional health events, and any related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic downturn.\n\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including international conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Throughout 2024, the Company faced disruption to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Geopolitical instability has in the past led, and may in the future lead, to logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; business disruptions (including labor shortages); increased risk of cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs; and heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or our assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from political activism, which have reduced demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders; price controls; limitations on profits; the negotiation of new trade agreements; new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs; import authorization requirements; and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.",

Negative reputational incidents or negative perceptions of us could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through lower sales, the termination of business relationships and negative impacts to associate retention and recruiting efforts. Moreover, failure to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and fulfillment centers could result in excess or insufficient inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could significantly harm our business. As we continue to add new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology networks become increasingly complex and operating them in a way that effectively meets consumer demands continues to be challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n\n## We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, data analytics/insights, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, quality and accessibility of data for customers, suppliers, and associates, and cost, speed of and options for accurate delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.\n\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omnichannel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\n\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, economics or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel, increased costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in GDP and consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of export and import restrictions, tariffs, trade barriers or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S., or in any of the other markets in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to any one or more markets with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales, growth rates, operating income and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\n\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative ex penses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\n\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing",

          "chunk_text": "future tax  benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the ex tent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax  benefits associated with deferred tax  assets by analyzing our forecasted tax able income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of ex isting tax able temporary differences; tax able income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax  benefit associated with a deferred tax  asset.\n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the ex tent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for ex ample, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## OPERATIONS REVIEW\n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading 'Net Operating Revenues' below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the ex tent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.",

Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. As of December 31, 2024, our self-insurance reserves totaled $168 million. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were $2,469 million. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in tax able amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $766 million, of which $82 million was related to VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is remote. As of December 31, 2024, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.\n\nIn 2024 and 2023, our operating income was impacted by the weighted-average fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies) and for certain individual currencies. These currencies strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:\n\n",

Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out ex penses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit ex posure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.

      "question": "How did the changes in accrued income taxes for KO and WMT in 2024 reflect differences in their tax payment strategies, and what was the combined impact on their cash flows from operating activities?",
      "answer": "KO reported a decrease in accrued income taxes from $24 million in 2023 to $0 million in 2024, indicating a full reversal or settlement of its accrued tax liability during the year. This positively impacted KO's cash flows from operating activities by $24 million. Conversely, WMT experienced an increase in accrued income taxes by $435 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, suggesting a shift toward higher tax accruals, which negatively impacted its cash flows by $435 million in 2024. The combined effect of these changes was a net negative impact of $411 million on their aggregate cash flows from operating activities related to accrued income tax movements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From KO's 2024 10-K filing, accrued income taxes decreased from $24 million in 2023 to $0 million in 2024, indicating a full reversal or settlement of the liability, which would improve cash flows by $24 million.",
        "Step 2: From WMT's 2024 10-K filing, accrued income taxes increased by $435 million in 2024, compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, indicating a significant shift in tax accrual behavior that would reduce cash flows by $435 million.",
        "Step 3: To determine the combined impact on cash flows from operating activities, subtract KO's $24 million positive impact from WMT's $435 million negative impact, resulting in a net negative impact of $411 million."

      "answer": "Costco projects a $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year. This increase stems from membership fee hikes and higher penetration of Executive Members. Meanwhile, Mondelez notes significant cost inflation pressures, including rising raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs, which have continued to increase. Both companies address cost pressures through pricing strategies\u2014Costco via membership fees and Mondelez through product pricing adjustments. The additional revenue Costco anticipates could help offset inflationary pressures, supporting its membership-driven profitability model. In contrast, Mondelez may need to rely more heavily on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to maintain profitability. These differing strategies reflect their business models and exposure to cost inflation, shaping how each company approaches profitability in a challenging cost environment.",

We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to ev aluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believ e these metrics are  useful  to  inv estors  as  they  prov ide  supplemental  information  in  addition  to  our  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  ('U.S.  GAAP') financial  results.  We  believ e  it  is  useful  to  prov ide  inv estors  with  the  same  financial  information  that  we  use  internally  to  make  comparisons  of  our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and ev aluate our business. We believ e our non-GAAP financial measures should  always  be  considered  in  relation  to  our  GAAP  results.  Refer  to Non-GAAP Financial  Measures for  the  definitions  of  our  non-GAAP  financial measures and Consolidated Results of Operations for the respectiv e reconciliations.\n\nIn  addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of dev elopments and trends that could impact our rev enue and profitability objectiv es:\n\n## Demand\n\nWe monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and bev erage categories in which we sell our products. Core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behav ior around the world. As part of our strategic plan, we seek to driv e category growth by lev eraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making inv estments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and dev eloped markets and improv ing our av ailability across multiple channels. We believ e these actions will help driv e demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.\n\n## Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends\n\nSnack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income lev els associated with a growing middle  class,  particularly  in  emerging  markets.  We  believ e  that  snacks  continue  to  be  a  source  of  comfort  as  well  as  excitement  and  v ariety  for consumers. Social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. Consumers are  also  interested  in  buying  snacks  conv eniently,  whether  through  same-day  deliv ery  platforms,  shipped  sources  or  different  retail  settings.  Many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, v aluing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. We seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.\n\n## Pricing\n\nOur net rev enue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints, the impact of tariffs and higher cost trends. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we hav e increased prices to control costs giv en significant cost inflation.\n\n## Operating Costs\n\nOur  operating  costs  include  raw  materials,  labor,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses,  taxes,  currency  impacts  and  financing  costs.  We manage these costs through cost saving and productiv ity initiativ es, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher ov erall raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs that hav e continued to rise. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information.\n\n## Trade and Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nIn many markets, including the United States, a portion of our products, including significant inputs, are imported from other jurisdictions. On February 1, 2025, the United States gov ernment announced tariffs up to 25% on imports from certain countries, including Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on product  imports  from  certain  countries,  including  China.  While  we  are  still  ev aluating  the  potential  impact  of  these  actions  as  well  as  our  ability  to mitigate the impact, they are expected to adv ersely impact our rev enue and cost of goods sold in the United States. If the prov isions of those tariffs were maintained as proposed, we would expect those adverse impacts to be significant. In addition, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries or other potential gov ernment actions, would likely result in further adv erse impacts to our rev enue and cost of goods sold. For additional information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors , including the risk entitled ' We are subject to risks from changes to the trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations by the U.S. and/or other foreign governments .'",

Coca-Cola also expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred but provides more detailed context around asset management, including depreciation ranges for buildings and equipment, and explicitly states that costs not extending economic life are expensed.

The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\n\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $997 million, $1,018 million and $1,125 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

      "answer": "Costco (COST) reported a total cost basis of $1,239 million for its short-term investments in 2024. The Coca-Cola Company (KO) determines the cost basis of its debt securities using the specific identification method. For KO, debt securities that the company intends to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost, while those classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. This means that while COST's reported cost basis is straightforward and aggregated, KO applies a more nuanced policy based on classification, which affects how the cost basis translates into reported values on the balance sheet.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COST's total cost basis of short-term investments is $1,239 million.",

We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\n\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our Company's investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n\n## Equity Securities\n\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\n\n",

Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher fair value of long-term debt at $38,052 million as of the same date. Coca-Cola\u2019s disclosure also included context about the use of interest rate swaps to manage fair value exposure due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which directly affects the valuation of its debt. Additionally, Coca-Cola extinguished $485 million of long-term debt in 2024, resulting in a $22 million gain, suggesting active debt portfolio management. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s disclosure focused solely on valuation methodology without mentioning active debt restructuring or hedging activities. These differences indicate that while both companies report fair value for long-term debt, Coca-Cola\u2019s disclosures suggest a more dynamic debt management strategy involving interest rate hedging and proactive debt retirement, whereas Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s approach appears more static in terms of valuation and reporting.",

For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial instruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the Company's fair value hedging strategy.\n\n## Investments in Debt and Equity Securities\n\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1.\n\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard valuation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\n\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap ('CDS') rates applied to each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty's CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.\n\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\n\n",

If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material.\n\nCash flows from derivatives  used  to  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  exchange  or  interest  rate  risks  are classified  as  operating  activities  in  the  cash  flow  statement.  We  classify  both  the  earnings  and  cash  flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any,  and  a  review  of  credit  ratings,  credit  default  swap  rates  and  potential  nonperformance  of  the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\n\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in  a  net  liability  position  if  our  credit  rating  is  at A2  (Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.)  or A  (S&amp;P  Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $247 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 25, 2021.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  which  primarily include  swaps  and  futures.  In  addition,  risk  to  our  supply  of  certain  raw  materials  is  mitigated  through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made, manufactured,  distributed  or  sold.  Additionally,  we  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  from  net investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries,  foreign  currency  purchases  and  foreign  currency  assets  and  liabilities created  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  We  manage  this  risk  through  sourcing  purchases  from  local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign  currency  transactions  are  recognized  as  transaction  gains  or  losses  on  our  income  statement  as incurred.  We  also  use  net  investment  hedges  to  partially  offset  the  effects  of  foreign  currency  on  our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.",

      "question": "Given that Sam's Club receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities, how does this infrastructure support PEP's reported 13% revenue dependency on Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, in 2021?",
      "answer": "PEP reported that in 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 13% of its consolidated net revenue, with this revenue generated across all divisions, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Sam's Club, as a segment of Walmart, receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically across the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities. This robust and strategically placed distribution infrastructure enables Sam's Club to efficiently receive and stock merchandise, including PEP's products, at scale. As a result, this infrastructure supports Walmart's ability to serve as a major customer for PEP, facilitating the consistent flow of products necessary to sustain PEP's significant revenue dependency on this customer relationship.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from PEP's filing - In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 13% of PEP's consolidated net revenue, with this revenue generated across all divisions, including through independent bottlers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from WMT's filing - Sam's Club receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The 28 dedicated and strategically located distribution facilities support Sam's Club\u2019s ability to efficiently receive and stock large volumes of merchandise, including products from PEP. This infrastructure enables Walmart (including Sam's Club) to maintain a consistent and large-scale product offering, which in turn supports PEP\u2019s 13% revenue dependency on this major customer relationship."

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam's  Club  (Sam's),  represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies,  as  well  as  regional,  local  and  private  label  manufacturers  and  economy  brands  and  other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our  products  are  sold,  including  the  United  States,  The  Coca-Cola  Company  is  our  primary  beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft  Heinz  Company,  Link  Snacks,  Inc.,  Mondel\u0113z  International,  Inc.,  Monster  Beverage  Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.\n\nMany of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2021, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc.

          "chunk_text": "Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omnichannel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.\n\nDistribution. We utilize 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2022, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 12 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.\n\nSam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\n## Suppliers and Supply Chain\n\nAs a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. We offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" under the sub-caption \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks.\"\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Priorities\n\nOur ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on.\n\nWe prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.",

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.

Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\n\n## Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.\n\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\n\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

In contrast, Procter & Gamble includes lease-related operating costs\u2014such as utilities, common area maintenance, and property taxes\u2014not included in lease liabilities as period expenses separate from the lease liability.

Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated  breakage  is  recognized  based  on  redemption  data.  The  Company  accounts  for  outstanding  shop  card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A  portion  of  the  royalty  is  used  to  fund  the  rebate  that  cardholders  receive,  after  taking  into  consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December  31.  The  Company  also  maintains  co-branded  credit  card  arrangements  in  Canada  and  certain  other International subsidiaries.\n\n## Merchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise  costs  consist  of  the  purchase  price  or  manufacturing  costs  of  inventory  sold,  inbound  and  outbound shipping  charges  and  all  costs  related  to  the  Company's  depot,  fulfillment  and  manufacturing  operations,  including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.\n\n## Vendor Consideration\n\nThe Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise  is  sold.  Other  vendor  consideration  is  generally  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  merchandise  costs  upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse  employees  (other  than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses  which  are  reflected  in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative  expenses  also  include  substantially  all  building  and  equipment  depreciation,  stock  compensation expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides  each  eligible  participant  an  annual  discretionary  contribution.  The Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  employees  in  Canada  and  contributes  a  percentage  of  each employee's  wages.  Certain  subsidiaries  in  the  Company's  Other  International  operations  have  defined  benefit  and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $824, $748, and $676 for 2022, 2021, and 2020, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.",

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31.

In contrast, Costco highlighted that its international operations, particularly in markets with smaller bases, experience higher rates of square footage growth, which contributes to net sales growth.

In contrast, PG provides specific historical net sales growth percentages by business segment, such as 2% for Beauty and 7% overall, demonstrating a more quantitative and segmented approach to reporting growth performance. This contrast suggests that COST focuses on the unpredictability of future growth in its disclosures, while PG emphasizes detailed, historical performance metrics to frame its growth narrative.",

For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future and may relate to such matters as net sales growth, changes in comparable sales, cannibalization of existing locations by new openings,  price  or  fee  changes,  earnings  performance,  earnings  per  share,  stock-based  compensation  expense, warehouse  openings  and  closures,  capital  spending,  the  effect  of  adopting  certain  accounting  standards,  future financial  reporting,  financing,  margins,  return  on  invested  capital,  strategic  direction,  expense  controls,  membership renewal rates, shopping frequency, litigation, and the demand for our products and services. In some cases, forwardlooking  statements can be identified because they contain words such as 'anticipate,' 'believe,' 'continue,' 'could,' 'estimate,'  'expect,'  'intend,'  'likely,'  'may,'  'might,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'predict,'  'project,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,' 'will,' 'would,' or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  that  may  cause  actual  events,  results,  or  performance  to  differ  materially  from  those  indicated  by such statements, including, without limitation, the factors set forth in the section titled 'Item 1A-Risk Factors', and other factors noted in the section titled 'Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto  Rico,  Canada,  Mexico,  Japan,  United  Kingdom  (U.K.),  Korea,  Taiwan, Australia,  Spain,  France,  China,  and Iceland.  Costco  operated  838,  815,  and  795  warehouses  worldwide  at  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and August 30, 2020, respectively. The Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan,  Japan,  and Australia.  Our  common  stock  trades  on  the  NASDAQ  Global  Select  Market,  under  the  symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-service  warehouse  facilities, these  volumes  and  turnover  enable  us  to  operate  profitably  at  significantly  lower  gross  margins  (net  sales  less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  For  our  e-commerce  operations  we  ship  merchandise  through  our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.",

In contrast, Target only referenced the existence of long-term operating lease liabilities under 'Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities' without providing a quantified figure, making a direct numerical comparison impossible.",

      "question": "How does COST's use of fixed-price contracts for fuel purchases compare with KO's exposure to fuel price fluctuations in terms of risk mitigation strategy and financial impact?",
      "answer": "COST actively mitigates fuel price risk by entering into fixed-price contracts for some of its fuel purchases, which helps stabilize costs and reduce exposure to market volatility. This approach is part of COST's broader strategy to manage commodity price risk, particularly for energy used in its operations. In contrast, KO does not explicitly mention using fixed-price contracts or other hedging mechanisms for fuel price risk. Instead, KO notes that fuel prices are a factor affecting its cost to manufacture and distribute products, indicating a more direct exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Therefore, while COST has a proactive risk mitigation strategy in place, KO appears to absorb fuel price volatility as part of its broader operational cost structure, making KO more vulnerable to increases in fuel prices.",

        "Step 1: From COST's 10-K, extract the specific mention of fixed-price contracts for fuel purchases and the intent to mitigate commodity price risk.",

Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to  fluctuations  in  market  volatility  and  interest  rates  are  reflected  within  stockholders'  equity  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.  The  contracts  are  intended  primarily  to  economically  hedge  exposure  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange  contracts,  see  Notes  1  and  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.",

We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to impact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also negatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. However, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the economic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the everchanging environment.\n\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions, there has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners' ability to manufacture or distribute our products.",

We also sell products directly to businesses and consumers through various pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, our Direct to Consumer websites and social media platforms.\n\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2021.

          "chunk_text": "Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.\n\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash &amp; carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.\n\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.\n- Divestiture of Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.\n- Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.\n\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers. A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity.\n\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900 delivery locations.\n\nMerchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Extra Special,\" \"Lider,\" \"Myntra,\" and \"PhonePe.\" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\n\nWalmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\n\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash &amp; carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omnichannel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) explicitly identifies rising costs of raw and packaging materials as a material risk in its 2023 10-K, citing geopolitical conflicts and inflationary pressures as contributing factors that could materially impact its business and financial condition. Coca-Cola (KO), while not directly stating rising raw material costs as a current expense, includes 'cost of raw materials' as a key assumption in its impairment testing of equity method investments and intangible assets. KO must estimate this cost as part of its critical accounting policies, indicating that increases in raw material costs could negatively affect asset valuations and profitability. Therefore, both companies are exposed to the same financial risk, with KO incorporating it into forward-looking impairment assessments, while CL identifies it as an active threat.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CL identifies rising raw material costs as a material risk due to geopolitical events and inflation.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to the same risk (rising raw material costs), but the impact manifests differently: CL faces direct operational risk, while KO incorporates it into forward-looking asset valuations."

For other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit oblig ation is the accumulated postretirement benefit oblig ation. The accumulated benefit oblig ation for our pension plans was $6,008 million and $6,463 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 1\n\nA change in the weig hted-averag e discount rate assumption was the primary driver of net actuarial loss (g ain) during  2024 and 2023. For our U.S. qualified pension plan, an increase in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial g ain of $178 million during  2024, and a decrease in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial loss of $129 million during  2023. Additional drivers of net actuarial loss (g ain) included other assumption updates and plan ex perience. 2\n\nSettlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all former employees. The U.S. qualified pension plan made $259 million of lump sum payments in 2023, causing  a plan settlement, which resulted in recog nition of a $76 million settlement loss related to the acceleration of existing  unrecog nized losses. 3\n\nIn 2024, the Company settled its U.S. other postretirement benefit oblig ations such that core life insurance benefits will be funded by an insurance company beg inning  September 11, 2024 for the lifetime of certain retirees. The transaction resulted in no chang e to underlying  benefits or plan administration, but only to the future financing  of the benefits. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company transferred $92 million of plan assets and liabilities to an insurer and recog nized a $19 million net settlement g ain related to the acceleration of ex isting unrecognized g ains. 4\n\nIn 2023, the Company settled its U.S. post-65 other postretirement benefit oblig ations such that retiree reimbursement accounts will be funded by an insurance company beg inning January 1, 2025 for the lifetime of certain retirees and their elig ible dependents.

          "chunk_text": "## Note 2.\n\n## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nPMI  uses  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  for  acquired  businesses. Under  the  acquisition  method,  PMI's  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. PMI allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf  PMI determines that assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business  combination  and,  therefore,  no  goodwill  will  be  recorded. In  an  asset  acquisition,  acquired  in-process  research  and  development  (\"IPR&amp;D\")  with  no alternative future use is charged to ex pense.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to 40 years.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. For further details, see Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP. PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the  benefit  obligation. PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability. Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes. PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nPMI follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets  or  liabilities;  quoted  prices  in  markets  that  are  not  active;  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by  observable  market  data  for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair  value  of  the  assets  or  liabilities. Categorization  within  the  valuation  hierarchy  is  based  upon  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement.",

This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.  This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.' This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\n\nNo other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## NOTE 2\n\n## SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) G rooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric &amp; Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of:\n\n- Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care);\n- Grooming : Grooming (Appliances, Female Blades &amp; Razors, Male Blades &amp; Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming);\n- Health Care :  Oral  Care  (Toothbrushes,  Toothpaste,  Other  Oral  Care);  Personal  Health  Care  (G astrointestinal,  Pain  Relief,  Rapid  Diagnostics,  Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care);\n- Fabric &amp; Home Care :  Fabric  Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&amp;G  Professional, Surface Care); and\n- Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Menstrual Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).\n\nWhile none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances (G rooming) and Personal Health Care (Health), are seasonal.\n\nThe accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital ex penditures in the segments are on an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet. Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.\n\nCorporate  includes  certain  operating  and  non-operating  activities  that  are  not  reflected  in  the  operating  results  used  internally  to  measure  and  evaluate  the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level.  Operating  elements  also  include  certain  employee  benefit  costs,  the  costs  of  certain  restructuring-type  activities  to  maintain  a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs.\n\nTotal assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Other assets, primarily cash, accounts receivable, investment securities and goodwill, are included in Corporate.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of  the  reporting  period.  Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales.  Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nP&amp;G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-theground operations in about 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; G rooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

Philip Morris International (PM) included 'Cost/Other' in their Consolidated Financial Summary, which explicitly incorporated Marketing, Administration and Research Costs, including restructuring charges.

For a breakdown of these costs by segment, see Note 7.\n- Tobacco and Health and Certain Other Litigation Items: For a discussion of tobacco and health and certain other litigation items and a breakdown of these costs by segment, see Note 20 and Tobacco and Health and Certain Other Litigation Items in Note 17, respectively.\n- Loss on Disposition of JUUL E quity Securities: We recorded a non-cash, pre-tax loss of $250 million related to the disposition of our former investment in JUUL for the year ended December 31, 2023 as (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statement of earnings. We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the JUUL tax valuation allowance in 2023. For further discussion, see Note 8 and Note 16.\n- ABI-Related Special Items: We recorded net pre-tax expense of $2 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consists primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments, mostly offset by a gain related to the ABI Transaction. For further information on the gain related to the ABI Transaction, see Note 8.\n\nWe recorded net pre-tax losses of $89 million from our investment in ABI for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting primarily of mark-to-market losses on certain ABI financial instruments associated with its share commitments and a loss on ABI's sale of certain brands and associated assets in the United States.\n\nThe ABI-related special items include our respective share of the amounts recorded by ABI and additional adjustments related to (i) the conversion of ABI-related special items from international financial reporting standards to GAAP and (ii) adjustments to our investment required under the equity method of accounting.\n\n- Cronos-Related Special Items: We recorded pre-tax losses of $29 million for Cronos-related special items for the year ended December 31, 2023, substantially all of which related to our share of special items recorded by Cronos. We recorded a corresponding adjustment to the Cronos tax valuation allowance.\n- Income Tax Items: We recorded income tax items of $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, due primarily to an income tax benefit from partial releases of valuation allowances on JUUL-related losses in connection with an agreement reached in October 2024 with the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and in connection with the ABI Transaction. For further discussion, see Note 16.\n\nWe recorded income tax items of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due primarily to tax expense associated with a tax basis adjustment related to our investment in ABI.\n\n## 2024 Compared with 2023\n\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $465 million (1.9%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher net revenues in the oral tobacco products segment.\n\nCost of sales decreased $141 million (2.3%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges and higher manufacturing costs in our smokeable products segment and higher NJOY costs.\n\nExcise taxes on products decreased $407 million (10.2%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in our smokeable products segment.\n\nMarketing, administration and research costs were unchanged compared to 2023 as higher costs, including NJOY and other costs in support of our Vision and 2024 costs related to the Initiative, were offset by lower general corporate ex penses. The lower general corporate ex penses were due primarily to lower charges to resolve certain JUUL-related litigation and the 2023 settlement of the shareholder derivative lawsuits, partially offset by higher net acquisition-related costs primarily associated with the NJOY Transaction and 2024 transaction costs from the ABI Transaction.

      "answer": "The combined total marketing accrued liabilities for Altria Group and Philip Morris International in 2024 were $1,703 million (Altria: $688 million + Philip Morris: $1,015 million). In 2023, their combined marketing accrued liabilities were $1,578 million (Altria: $716 million + Philip Morris: $862 million). This represents an increase of $125 million, or approximately 7.9%, from 2023 to 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Altria Group's 2024 10-K filing, extract the 2024 marketing accrued liabilities of $688 million and the 2023 value of $716 million.",
        "Step 2: From Philip Morris International's 2024 10-K filing, extract the 2024 marketing and selling accrued liabilities of $1,015 million and the 2023 value of $862 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the combined marketing accrued liabilities for both companies in 2024: $688 million (Altria) + $1,015 million (Philip Morris) = $1,703 million.",

      "answer": "For MDLZ, favorable volume/mix was a key contributor to the 14.7% organic net revenue growth, alongside higher net pricing. This favorable volume/mix was driven by performance in AMEA, Latin America, and Europe, which saw improved product mix and volume gains, while North America remained flat. In comparison, PM reported an 8.6% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, which was also attributed to favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partially offset by lower cigarette volume. Thus, while both companies benefited from favorable volume/mix, MDLZ experienced broader regional volume and mix improvements, whereas PM's gains were more product-specific, centered on HTUs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from MDLZ evidence - Organic Net Revenue growth of 14.7% was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, with regional contributions from AMEA, Latin America, and Europe.",
        "Step 2: Extract from PM evidence - Net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 8.6%, driven by favorable pricing and volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both MDLZ and PM cited favorable volume/mix as a key growth driver, but the nature of the impact differed: MDLZ saw broad-based regional and product mix gains, while PM\u2019s volume/mix improvements were product-specific (HTUs) and partially offset by declines in cigarette volume."

      "answer": "Colgate (CL) highlights that temporary differences between financial and tax accounting cause the current tax provision to be higher or lower than the total income tax provision, though it does not provide specific dollar amounts. In contrast, Costco (COST) provides detailed figures showing its 2023 deferred tax provision at $33 million (federal), $10 million (state), and $(10)$ million (foreign), totaling $33M + $10M - $10M = $33 million. This allows a comparison: while both companies experience temporary differences, only Costco quantifies the impact, revealing a relatively small net deferred tax liability in 2023, which contrasts with Colgate\u2019s qualitative emphasis on potentially significant effects.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From CL's 10-K, we learn that temporary differences between financial and tax reporting cause the current tax provision to differ from the total income tax provision, though no specific numbers are given.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's Asia Pacific segment experienced a -4.0% foreign exchange (FX) impact on net sales growth, contributing to an overall -1.5% organic sales growth in that region. In contrast, Costco notes that its international operations benefit from lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, which supports their financial performance despite FX fluctuations. While Colgate's Asia Pacific segment struggled with FX headwinds that significantly dampened reported sales growth, Costco's international cost structure appears to provide a structural advantage in managing FX pressures, even though it does not directly mitigate the FX impact on reported sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from CL_10k_2023.pdf - The Asia Pacific segment had a -4.0% foreign exchange impact on net sales growth, resulting in a reported -1.5% organic sales growth.",
        "Step 2: Extract from COST_10k_2023.pdf - Costco's international operations benefit from lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, which contributes to their financial performance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While Colgate-Palmolive's Asia Pacific sales were negatively affected by FX movements, Costco's international cost structure provides a financial advantage that may help absorb such impacts, even if FX still affects reported sales growth."

      "answer": "COST's net sales growth is directly influenced by gasoline price fluctuations, where rising prices increase net sales but reduce gross margin percentage due to lower profitability per gallon. Conversely, falling prices lower net sales but improve gross margin percentage. This dynamic shows that COST's net sales growth is significantly shaped by external market conditions beyond its control. In contrast, CL measures organic sales growth by excluding external factors such as foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments to focus on underlying business performance. CL's approach allows for a clearer view of internal growth drivers by filtering out volatility from external influences, which COST explicitly includes in its net sales growth calculations. This results in different financial narratives: COST's growth reflects market-driven volatility, while CL's organic growth isolates strategic business performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COST's 10-K, identify that rising gasoline prices increase net sales but lower gross margin percentage, while falling prices have the opposite effect.",
        "Step 2: From CL's 10-K, note that the company uses organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments to evaluate underlying performance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two approaches: COST's net sales growth includes external market factors (gasoline prices), while CL's organic sales growth removes external influences to focus on internal performance trends."

This creates a competitive dynamic where PepsiCo depends on a major customer (Sam\u2019s Club) that is itself a competitor to Costco in the broader consumer staples market.

Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter.  However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a m aterial i m pact on our consolidated financial results.\n\n## Our Customers\n\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice custom ers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, m ass m erchandisers, m em bership stores, hard discounters, e-com m erce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, am ong others.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified because they contain words  such  as  'anticipate,'  'believ e,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'estimate,'  'expect,'  'intend,'  'likely,'  'may,'  'might,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'predict,'  'project,' 'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  similar  expressions  and  the  negativ es  of  those  terms.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). T he material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024, and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  sites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of nationally-branded and priv ate-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales v olumes and rapid inv entory turnov er. When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inv entory before we are required to pay for it, ev en while taking adv antage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots  receiv e  large  shipments  from  suppliers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  T his  process  creates  freight  v olume  and  handling efficiencies,  lowering  costs  associated  with  traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  Our  e-commerce  operations  ship  merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other deliv ery arrangements with our suppliers.",

      "question": "How does the impact of net sales growth on cost management efficiency differ between Procter & Gamble's SG&A expenses and Walmart's Sam's Club segment performance, and what specific factors contribute to these differences?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble experienced a 10% increase in SG&A expenses to $23.3 billion, with SG&A as a percentage of net sales rising 200 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to increased marketing spending. Although marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased by 170 basis points, this was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. In contrast, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club segment saw net sales increase by $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2024, with comparable sales growth benefiting from increases in transactions and average ticket, particularly in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam\u2019s Club segment also experienced a positive contribution from e-commerce sales, which helped offset declines in fuel sales due to deflation. While P&G\u2019s cost management was challenged by higher SG&A relative to sales growth, Walmart\u2019s segment performance reflected more direct alignment between sales growth and operational efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Procter & Gamble\u2019s filing, extract the 10% increase in SG&A expenses to $23.3 billion and the 200 basis point rise in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, driven by marketing spending increases of 170 basis points, partially offset by scale and productivity benefits.",
        "Step 2: From Walmart\u2019s filing, extract the $1.8 billion or 2.2% net sales increase in the Sam\u2019s Club segment for fiscal 2024, driven by comparable sales growth, e-commerce contributions, and partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the difference in cost management outcomes: P&G faced rising SG&A pressure despite net sales growth, while Walmart\u2019s segment performance showed more direct benefits from sales increases through operational efficiency and e-commerce."

In contrast, Walmart's filing lists the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity as part of its financial statements but provides no detailed breakdown or specific figures in the excerpt, indicating a less transparent presentation.

      "question": "How do Altria's and Walmart's approaches to managing their working capital deficits reflect their different strategies for utilizing cash resources to fund operations and shareholder returns, given Altria's reliance on operating cash flows and Walmart's strategic inventory management initiatives as of their respective fiscal years?",
      "answer": "Altria (MO) explicitly states that it funds its working capital deficit through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement, and access to credit and capital markets. In 2023, Altria generated $9.3 billion in net cash from operating activities and used this cash to fund $8.4 billion in financing activities, including $6.8 billion in dividends paid and share repurchases. This demonstrates a strategy of leveraging strong operating cash flows to maintain shareholder returns despite a working capital deficit.\n\nWalmart (WMT), on the other hand, attributes its working capital deficit reduction from $16.5 billion (as of January 31, 2023) to $15.5 billion (as of January 31, 2024) to strategic inventory management initiatives. Walmart generated $35.7 billion in net cash from operating activities in fiscal 2024, which it used for shareholder returns while also reducing its deficit. Walmart specifically highlights that its deficit is managed through efficient cash use, capital market access, and working capital initiatives like inventory optimization.\n\nThe difference in approach reflects Altria's reliance on stable operating cash flows from its tobacco business model versus Walmart's focus on operational efficiency improvements in its retail model to manage liquidity and fund shareholder returns.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria (MO) discloses $9.3 billion in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 and explicitly states it funds working capital deficits through operating cash flows, borrowings, and capital market access.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - Altria used $8.4 billion in financing activities in 2023, including $6.8 billion in dividends paid, showing how working capital deficit funding supports shareholder returns.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - Walmart (WMT) reports a working capital deficit of $15.5 billion as of January 31, 2024, down from $16.5 billion in the prior year, attributing the decrease to strategic inventory management and working capital initiatives.",

        "Step 5: Synthesize - Compare Altria's reliance on operating cash flows to fund shareholder returns despite a working capital deficit with Walmart's use of operational efficiency (especially inventory management) to reduce its deficit while also funding shareholder returns."

Altria specifically notes that adult tobacco consumers are experiencing discretionary income pressures due to inflation and high consumer debt levels, influencing their purchasing behaviors, including reduced expenditures on smoke-free products. Similarly, Walmart highlights that higher consumer debt levels may reduce discretionary spending, which could negatively affect its net sales, growth rates, and inventory turnover.

      "question": "How does Altria's dependency on subsidiary cash flows for liquidity compare to Walmart's funding considerations for its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, and what role does each company's cost of borrowings play in their respective capital allocation decisions?",
      "answer": "Altria, as a holding company, is primarily dependent on the capital resources of its subsidiaries to satisfy its liquidity requirements, receiving cash from dividends, distributions, and interest on intercompany loans. At the end of 2023, Altria had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and believed its liquidity position, including access to credit markets and future operating cash flows, was sufficient to meet its obligations and fund dividends, share repurchases, and debt repayments. Walmart, on the other hand, considers several factors when executing its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, including current cash needs, leverage capacity, and the cost of borrowings. As of January 31, 2024, $16.5 billion remained available under the program, which Walmart expects to fund primarily through free cash flow. Both companies factor the cost of borrowings into their capital allocation decisions, but Altria's reliance on subsidiary cash flows reflects a structural dependency, while Walmart's approach is more directly tied to its operational free cash flow generation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Altria is a holding company dependent on subsidiary cash flows, with $3.7 billion in cash and access to credit markets to fund dividends, share repurchases, and other obligations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Walmart evaluates share repurchases considering current cash needs, leverage capacity, and cost of borrowings, with $16.5 billion remaining under its $20.0 billion repurchase program as of January 31, 2024.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies consider the cost of borrowings in capital allocation, but Altria has a structural dependency on subsidiary cash flows, while Walmart relies on free cash flow for its repurchase program."

      "answer": "In 2023, increased marketing spending negatively impacted both Coca-Cola's operating income trends and Procter & Gamble's net earnings margin. For Coca-Cola, higher marketing spending contributed to declines or constraints in operating income across several regions: Asia Pacific's operating income fell by $263 million (from $2,303 million to $2,040 million), while North America and Latin America saw operating income growth that was partially offset by this spending. Additionally, Corporate operating loss increased by $1,069 million, partly due to increased marketing spending. For Procter & Gamble, the increase in marketing spending caused SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales to rise, which contributed to a 170 basis-point decline in net earnings margin despite a sales increase, ultimately leading to a 7% decrease in net earnings to $3.0 billion.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experienced increased marketing spending in 2023, which had distinct financial impacts: constraining operating income growth or causing declines at Coca-Cola, and compressing net earnings margin at Procter & Gamble despite revenue gains."

This suggests that the marketing investment did not yield a positive return in terms of profitability in that region. In contrast, PG's marketing spending in Europe and North America supported innovation and market growth, contributing to a high single-digit sales increase in Europe and a low single-digit increase in North America. PG's marketing strategy led to global market share growth in Home Care (+0.8 points) and a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin, despite increased SG&A expenses. Therefore, PG's marketing investment strategy appears more effective in driving both top-line growth and margin expansion compared to KO's Asia Pacific approach.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's 2023 10-K filing reveals that marketing spending is a critical assumption used in impairment testing for equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This indicates that projected marketing expenditures directly influence the valuation and recoverability assessment of these assets. On the other hand, Procter & Gamble's 2023 10-K filing shows that marketing spending is one of the key drivers of operational performance, affecting net sales and underlying unit volume by shaping consumer demand and supporting product initiatives. Together, these disclosures highlight that marketing spending plays a dual role: for Coca-Cola, it is a forward-looking assumption in asset valuation, while for Procter & Gamble, it is an active lever to influence current financial performance.",

      "question": "How did the impact of pricing strategies on net sales growth differ between Costco's fiscal 2023 and Procter & Gamble's fiscal 2024, and what were the associated effects on operating margins for each company?",
      "answer": "In Costco's fiscal 2023, rising gasoline prices positively impacted net sales growth, which increased the sales base and consequently decreased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, although it also lowered gross margin percentages. In contrast, Procter & Gamble reported a 2% increase in net sales for fiscal 2024, primarily driven by a 4% pricing increase, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. P&G did not specify direct margin impacts, but the reliance on pricing suggests a strategy to maintain or improve margins through revenue per unit. Costco's operating model shows that higher sales from gasoline lower gross margin but reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales, while P&G\u2019s pricing strategy aimed at maintaining profitability through higher pricing without explicit mention of margin compression.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Costco's fiscal 2023 net sales growth was positively impacted by rising gasoline prices, which decreased gross margin percentage but reduced SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Procter & Gamble\u2019s fiscal 2024 net sales increased by 2%, with 4% higher pricing as the primary driver, partially offset by 2% unfavorable foreign exchange.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies experienced net sales growth, Costco's growth was tied to gasoline pricing dynamics that affected gross and operating margins inversely, whereas P&G's growth was driven by product pricing with an implied intent to preserve or enhance margins."

In contrast, Costco's forward-looking statements highlight that net sales growth is influenced by a variety of factors including comparable sales changes, price or fee changes, warehouse openings and closures, capital spending, and demand for products and services.

These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8  billion  between  2023  and  2041  and  $2.9  billion  may  be  carried  forward  indefinitely.  We  establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n\n## Undistributed International Earnings\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future  distribution  of  these  earnings  would  not  be  subject  to  U.S.  federal  tax  expense,  no  deferred  tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state  taxes  have  been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\n\n## Note 6 - Share-Based Compensation\n\nOur  share-based  compensation  program  is  designed  to  attract  and  retain  employees  while  also  aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\n\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.",

          "chunk_text": "On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court's findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD 13.5 billion including interest (approximately $10.6 billion) due to the trial court's error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several  basis  with  an  allocation  of  20%  to  RBH  (approximately  CAD  2.7  billion,  including  pre-judgment  interest  (approximately  $2.1 billion)). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by conspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either need not  prove,  or  had  adequately  proven,  that  these  faults  were  a  cause  of  the  class  members'  injuries.  In  accordance  with  the  judgment, defendants were required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the L\u00e9tourneau case described below and the Blais case, approximately CAD 1.1 billion (approximately $862 million), into trust accounts within 60 days. RBH's share of the deposit was approximately CAD 257 million (approximately $194 million). PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million in its consolidated results, representing $142 million net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related expense, in the first quarter of 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.\n\nIn the second class action pending in Canada, Cecilia L\u00e9tourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTIMacdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada, filed in September 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued  its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of CAD 131 million (approximately $103 million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 46 million (approximately $36 million) to RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at 918,000 members but declined to award compensatory damages to the addiction class because the  evidence  did  not  establish  the  claims  with  sufficient  accuracy.  The  trial  court  found  that  a  claims  process  to  allocate  the  awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer. On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court's findings of liability and the total amount of punitive damages awarded allocating CAD 57 million including interest (approximately $45 million) to RBH. See the Blais description above and Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH below for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases and the impact of the decision on PMI's financial statements.\n\nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect and in contravention of applicable law on several grounds including the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or should have  known,  of  the  risks  of  smoking;  (ii)  defendants  cannot  be  liable  to  class  members  who  would  have  smoked  regardless  of  what warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences between class members.\n\nIn  the  third  class  action  pending  in  Canada, Kunta v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Winnipeg, Canada , filed June 12, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ('COPD'), severe asthma, and mild reversible lung disease resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products.\n\nIn  the  fourth  class  action  pending  in  Canada, Adams  v.  Canadian  Tobacco  Manufacturers'  Council,  et  al., The  Queen's  Bench, Saskatchewan, Canada , filed July 10, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who have smoked a minimum  of  25,000  cigarettes  and  have  allegedly  suffered,  or  suffer,  from  COPD,  emphysema,  heart  disease,  or  cancer,  as  well  as restitution of profits.\n\nIn the fifth class action pending in Canada, Semple v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Supreme Court (trial court), Nova Scotia, Canada ,  filed  June 18, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges his own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products.  He  is  seeking  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  on  behalf  of  a  proposed  class  comprised  of  all  smokers,  their  estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products.\n\nIn  the  sixth  class  action  pending  in  Canada, Dorion v.  Canadian  Tobacco  Manufacturers'  Council,  et  al.,  The  Queen's  Bench, Alberta, Canada, filed June 15, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic bronchitis and severe sinus infections resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 20.\n\n## Deconsolidation of RBH:\n\nAs discussed in Note 17. Contingencies, following the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec in two class action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019. This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense  was  included  in  marketing,  administration  and  research  costs  on  PMI's  consolidated  statement  of  earnings  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to  the  deconsolidation  of  RBH  and  corresponds  to  the  trust  account  deposit  required  by  the  judgment.  RBH's  share  of  the  deposit  is approximately CAD 257 million.\n\nOn March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees.\n\nThe administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. PMI has also determined that it does not exert \"significant influence\" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures). Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.\n\nFollowing the deconsolidation, the carrying value of assets and liabilities of RBH was removed from the consolidated balance sheet of PMI, and the continuing investment in RBH was recorded at fair value at the date of deconsolidation. The total amount deconsolidated from PMI's balance sheet was $3,519 million, including $1,323 million of cash, $1,463 million of goodwill, $529 million of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, primarily related to historical currency translation and $204 million of other assets and liabilities, net. While PMI is accounting for its investment in RBH as an equity security, PMI would recognize dividends as income upon receipt. However, while it remains under creditor protection, RBH does not anticipate paying dividends.\n\nThe fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $3,280 million was determined at the date of deconsolidation, recorded within equity investments and is assessed for impairment on an ongoing basis. The estimated fair value of the underlying business was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as a market approach for certain contingent liabilities. The information used in the estimate includes observable inputs, primarily a discount rate of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2.5% and information about total tobacco market size in Canada and RBH's share of the market, as well as unobservable inputs such as operating budgets and strategic plans, various inflation scenarios, estimated shipment volumes, and expected product pricing and projected margins.\n\nThe difference between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of RBH that were deconsolidated and the fair value of the continuing investment, as determined at the date of deconsolidation, was $239 million, before tax, and this loss on deconsolidation is reflected within marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. PMI also recorded a tax benefit of $49 million within the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings of RBH.\n\nRBH is party to transactions with PMI and its consolidated subsidiaries entered into in the normal course of business; these transactions include royalty payments and recharge of various corporate expenses for services benefiting RBH. Up to the date of the CCAA filing, these transactions were eliminated on consolidation and had no impact on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings. After deconsolidating RBH, these transactions are treated as third-party transactions in PMI's financial statements. The amount of these related-party transactions is included within Note 4. Related Parties - Equity investments and Other.\n\nDevelopments in the CCAA process, including resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all pending tobacco-related litigation currently stayed in Canada, as discussed in Note 17. Contingencies , could result in a material change in the fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH.",

MO's EPS is significantly impacted by several special items including $250 million loss on disposition of JUUL equity securities and $430 million related to tobacco and health litigation, which reduce the reported EPS. In contrast, TGT adjusts very little from its GAAP diluted EPS, with only a $0.03 adjustment in 2022 and no adjustments in 2023, meaning its EPS remains largely unchanged. This shows that MO's financial performance, as measured by EPS, is more heavily influenced by one-time or special items compared to TGT, which reports a more stable earnings picture.",

      "question": "How do COST's strategy of reducing prices to maintain competitive value and PM's reliance on price increases to protect margins create opposing approaches to managing profitability in response to inflationary pressures?",
      "answer": "COST actively absorbs or mitigates cost increases by working with suppliers, purchasing in bulk, and sometimes holding prices steady despite inflation, which negatively impacts gross margin. In contrast, PM explicitly states that enhancing margins through price increases is a key strategy for profitability. These opposing tactics reflect fundamentally different approaches to managing inflation: COST prioritizes price competitiveness to maintain customer loyalty, while PM focuses on leveraging pricing power to sustain profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COST's 10-K, we learn that they absorb cost increases through supplier collaboration, early and bulk purchasing, and sometimes hold prices steady despite inflation, which negatively affects gross margin.",
        "Step 2: From PM's 10-K, we see that 'protecting or enhancing margins through price increases' is explicitly listed as a key success factor, indicating a strategic reliance on raising prices to maintain profitability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both approaches reveals opposing strategies: COST reduces or stabilizes prices to maintain member loyalty and pricing authority, whereas PM raises prices as a central mechanism to support margins."

MD&amp;A  is  provided  as  a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section  generally  discusses  the  results  of operations for  2022  compared to 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition  for  2021  compared  to  2020  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  our  fiscal  year  2021  Form  10-K,  which  was  filed  with  the  United  States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 6, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline,  pharmacy,  optical,  food  court,  hearing  aids,  and  tire  installation)  and  other  businesses  (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members  and  the  amount  they  spend  on  each  visit  (average  ticket).  Sales  comparisons  can  also  be  particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international  operations);  inflation  and  changes  in  the  cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions.  The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&amp;A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or  reliably  predict  general  economic  health  or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term  on  maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our members of our 'pricing authority' - consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlierthan-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost  increases  on  to  our  members.  Our  investments  in  merchandise  pricing  may  include  reducing  prices  on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).\n\nWe  believe  our  gasoline  business  enhances  traffic  in  our  warehouses,  but  it  generally  has  a  lower  gross  margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-",

Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.\n\n## We  may  be  unable  to  expand  our  brand  portfolio  through  successful  acquisitions  or  the  development  of  strategic  business relationships, and the intended benefits from our investments may not materialize.\n\nOne  element  of  our  growth  strategy  is  to  expand  our  brand  portfolio  and  market  positions  through  selective  acquisitions  and  the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of  failing  to  achieve  efficient  and  effective  integration,  strategic  objectives  and/or  anticipated  revenue  improvements  and  cost  savings.

In addition, we may not have a controlling position in certain strategic investments or relationships, which could impact  the  extent  to  which  the  intended  financial  growth  and  other  benefits  from  these  investments  or  relationships  may  ultimately materialize.\n\n## Our ability  to  achieve  our  strategic  goals  may  be  impaired  if  we  fail  to  attract,  motivate  and  retain  the  best  global  talent  and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation.\n\nTo be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. We compete for talent, including in areas that  are  new  to  us,  such  as  digital,  information  technology,  life  sciences,  with  companies  in  the  consumer  products,  technology, pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.",

In contrast, Philip Morris International includes shipping and handling costs as part of the cost of sales, indicating that these costs are treated as integral to the delivery of products to market.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nderivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currencies of the Company's international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company's  consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar  payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreigncurrency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  sales  for  the  amount  of  consideration  collected  from  the  member,  which  includes  gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery,  which  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assets,  respectively,  in  the  consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh  foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly  to  the  member,  shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the  member  picks  up  merchandise  at  the  warehouse.  Deferred  sales  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its  transactions  and  recognizes  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally  is  established  when  Costco  is  primarily  responsible  for  merchandising  decisions,  pricing  discretion,  and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction.\n\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability  classified  as  accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the  net  reduction  in  sales  was  $2,307,  $2,047,  and  $1,707 respectively.",

In addition, we had accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on our postretirement health care and pension obligations, see Note 18.\n\nIn October 2024, we entered into an agreement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of a $6.4 billion ordinary loss we recognized in 2023 for cash tax purposes with respect to a portion of our tax  basis associated with our former investment in JUUL. As a result, other liabilities decreased approx imately $1.1 billion, which included the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit associated with the $6.4 billion ordinary loss position recognized in 2023, as further discussed in Note 16.\n\nWe are unable to estimate the timing of payments of other long-term liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Equity and Dividends\n\nDuring 2024, we paid dividends of $6.8 billion, essentially unchanged from 2023, reflecting a higher dividend rate, mostly offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our Board approved a 4.1% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $1.02 per share of our common stock versus the previous rate of $0.98 per share. Our current annualized dividend rate is $4.08 per share. Our 2028 Goals include a progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.\n\nIn March 2024, we increased our $1.0 billion share repurchase program to $3.4 billion and entered into ASR transactions for our common stock. In the first half of 2024, we paid $2.4 billion for the repurchase of our common stock in the ASR transactions. We funded the ASR transactions with proceeds from the ABI Transaction.\n\nFor further discussion of our share repurchase programs, see Note 12 and Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Financial Review\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 billion compared with $9.3 billion during 2023. This decrease was due primarily to lower net revenues, payments for certain transferable income tax credits, higher litigation payments and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($140 million), partially offset by lower payments for (i) federal ex cise tax es and (ii) Statement Settlement Agreements, due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume.\n\nWe had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and believe we have the ability to fund working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and access to the credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion during 2023. This change was due primarily to proceeds from the ABI Transaction in 2024 and the payments for the NJOY Transaction in 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of IQOS System commercialization rights in 2023.\n\nCapital expenditures for 2024 decreased 27.6% to $142 million. We expect capital expenditures for 2025 to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million, which are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 billion compared with $8.4 billion during 2023. This increase was due primarily to higher share repurchases in 2024, issuance of long-term debt in 2023 and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($110 million), partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2024.\n\n## New Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, us.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nSee Note 20 and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies.\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA ('Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. ('Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program ('Guarantees').

Stock Plans\n\nIn 2020, our Board adopted, and shareholders approved, the Altria Group, Inc. 2020 Performance Incentive Plan ('2020 Plan') under which we may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance stock units ('PSUs') and other stock-based awards, as well as cashbased annual and long-term incentive awards to our employees. Any awards granted under the 2020 Plan may be in the form of performance-based awards, including PSUs subject to the achievement or satisfaction of performance goals and performance cycles. We may issue up to 25 million shares of common stock under the 2020 Plan prior to May 31, 2025. In addition, under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors ('Directors Plan'), we may grant up to one million shares of common stock to members of the Board who are not employees of Altria, provided that no awards can be made under the Directors Plan after the awards made immediately following our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had 18,507,747 and 533,843 shares available to be granted under the 2020 Plan and the Directors Plan, respectively.\n\n- RSUs: During the vesting period, RSUs include nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered. RSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. We estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust this estimate when subsequent information indicates that the actual number of forfeitures is likely to differ from previous estimates. RSUs generally vest three years after the grant date.\n\nWe amortize to expense ratably over the restriction period, which is generally three years, the fair value of the RSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $50 million, $47 million and $41 million, respectively. We recorded a deferred tax benefit related to this compensation expense of $12 million, $12 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to RSUs was $86 million at December 31, 2024, which we expect to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.\n\nRSU activity was as follows:\n\n",

Stock Plans\n\nIn 2020, our Board adopted, and shareholders approved, the Altria Group, Inc. 2020 Performance Incentive Plan ('2020 Plan') under which we may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), performance stock units ('PSUs') and other stock-based awards, as well as cashbased annual and long-term incentive awards to our employees. Any awards granted under the 2020 Plan may be in the form of performance-based awards, including PSUs subject to the achievement or satisfaction of performance goals and performance cycles. We may issue up to 25 million shares of common stock under the 2020 Plan prior to May 31, 2025. In addition, under the 2015 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors ('Directors Plan'), we may grant up to one million shares of common stock to members of the Board who are not employees of Altria, provided that no awards can be made under the Directors Plan after the awards made immediately following our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had 18,507,747 and 533,843 shares available to be granted under the 2020 Plan and the Directors Plan, respectively.\n\n- RSUs: During the vesting period, RSUs include nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and may not be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered. RSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. We estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust this estimate when subsequent information indicates that the actual number of forfeitures is likely to differ from previous estimates. RSUs generally vest three years after the grant date.\n\nWe amortize to expense ratably over the restriction period, which is generally three years, the fair value of the RSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $50 million, $47 million and $41 million, respectively. We recorded a deferred tax benefit related to this compensation expense of $12 million, $12 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to RSUs was $86 million at December 31, 2024, which we expect to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.\n\nRSU activity was as follows:\n\n",

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\n## PART I\n\n## Item 1-Business\n\nCostco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are  principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia,  T aiwan,  China,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  New  Z ealand,  and  Sweden.  Costco  operated  890,  861,  and  838  warehouses  worldwide  at September 1, 2024, September 3, 2023, and August 28, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol 'COST.'\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (fiv e weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). T he material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended September 1, 2024, and August 28, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.\n\n## General\n\nWe operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  sites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited  selection  of nationally-branded and priv ate-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales v olumes and rapid inv entory turnov er. When combined with  the  operating  efficiencies  achiev ed  by  v olume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of  merchandise  in  no-frills,  self-serv ice warehouse facilities, these v olumes and turnov er enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inv entory before we are required to pay for it, ev en while taking adv antage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots  receiv e  large  shipments  from  suppliers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  T his  process  creates  freight  v olume  and  handling efficiencies,  lowering  costs  associated  with  traditional  multiple-step  distribution  channels.  Our  e-commerce  operations  ship  merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other deliv ery arrangements with our suppliers.",

      "answer": "The difference in Net Sales Growth percentage for the Total Company between Colgate-Palmolive and Costco in 2024 is 1% (Costco at 5% vs. Colgate at 4%). However, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Costco still reported a 6% growth, while Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s organic growth was not explicitly stated, but the document emphasizes that organic sales growth (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments) provides a clearer picture of underlying performance. Thus, Costco experienced higher growth when adjusting for foreign exchange.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Colgate-Palmolive reported a 4% Net Sales Growth (GAAP) for 2024, and the document discusses organic sales growth as a non-GAAP measure that excludes foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Costco reported 5% Net Sales Growth for the Total Company in 2024, and 6% growth when excluding the impact of foreign currency and gasoline prices.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two companies' Net Sales Growth percentages and evaluate the adjusted growth figures to determine which company had higher growth when foreign exchange effects are excluded."

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nNet sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign ex change, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is provided below.\n\nGross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative ex penses, Selling, general and administrative ex penses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) ex pense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the ERISA litigation matter, the foreign tax matter and the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and product recall costs. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company's normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax  matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company's business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.",

The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 6.4% and 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed. Comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% and 5.4% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.\n\nGross profit rate increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022 and was flat for fiscal 2021, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year.

      "answer": "The Philippine Peso's fluctuation negatively impacted The Coca-Cola Company's (KO) 2023 operating income by (3)%, as stated in its 10-K filing. Philip Morris International (PM) is also exposed to the Philippine Peso due to its global operations and uses foreign exchange contracts to mitigate such risk. Therefore, both companies are financially affected by movements in the Philippine Peso, and KO's specific impact for 2023 was a 3% reduction in operating income.",

Similarly, Philip Morris (PM) evaluates the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of its equity investments has been below the carrying amount to determine whether a loss is other than temporary and thus requires impairment recognition. Both companies rely on this time-based indicator as a key factor in deciding whether to recognize an impairment loss, though KO specifically ties this evaluation to its intent and ability to retain the investment for recovery, while PM focuses on the financial condition of the investee and its intent to retain the investment.",

      "answer": "For KO, a decrease in the discount rate in 2023 resulted in an actuarial loss of $129 million, while an increase in the discount rate in 2022 resulted in an actuarial gain of $1,231 million. KO recognized these gains and losses directly as part of its net periodic benefit cost due to changes in assumptions and plan experience. In contrast, PM uses the corridor approach to recognize actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans, which means it only recognizes these items as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses) net of deferred taxes, rather than immediately expensing them. This indicates a difference in accounting policy between the two companies for handling pension-related actuarial variances.",

MO experienced a change of $719 million (from $0 to $(719) million), while TGT had a change of $57 million (from $0 to $(57) million).

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive is proactively reducing direct materials costs through its funding-the-growth initiatives, which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, and supplier consolidation. These efforts are part of a broader productivity program expected to result in $200 to $240 million in cumulative pre-tax charges, with a goal of achieving long-term margin expansion. In contrast, Altria is facing inflationary pressures that are increasing direct materials costs, which are factored into its 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.79 to $4.93. These rising costs are a headwind that Altria is managing through strategic investments and pricing actions. The financial implications for Colgate are upfront restructuring costs with long-term savings, while for Altria, the rising costs are being absorbed within a framework of maintaining earnings growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Strategy\n\nTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

Altria expects 2022 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year. While the 2022 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios, the external environment remains dynamic. Altria will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy, including the impact of increased inflation, (ii) the impact of current and future COVID-19 variants and mitigation strategies, (iii) adult tobacco consumer dynamics, including tobacco usage occasions, available disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products and (iv) regulatory and legislative developments.\n\nAltria's 2022 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of its Vision, such as (i) costs to enhance its digital consumer engagement system, (ii) increased smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparation expenses and (iii) marketplace activities in support of Altria's smoke-free products. The guidance range also includes anticipated inflationary increases in MSA expenses and direct materials costs and Altria's current expectation that PM USA will not have access to the IQOS system in 2022.\n\nAltria expects its 2022 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 24.5% to 25.5%.\n\n",
