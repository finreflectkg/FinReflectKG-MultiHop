      "answer": "The expected return on plan assets decreased by 20 basis points for CAT (from 4.2% in 2021 to 4.0% in 2022) and by an implied 20 basis points for HON due to a change in allocation of UK plan assets. This reduction in expected returns contributed to the increase in pension expense for CAT and was a primary factor in the decrease in pension income for HON in 2022. For CAT, this change was a key driver of the $168 million expected increase in net periodic benefit cost, while for HON, it contributed to the $75 million decline in pension income (from $1,083 million in 2021 to $1,008 million in 2022).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CAT's expected return on plan assets decreased from 4.2% in 2021 to 4.0% in 2022, contributing to a $168 million increase in net periodic benefit cost.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - HON's pension income decreased from $1,083 million in 2021 to $1,008 million in 2022, a $75 million decline, primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets caused by a change in allocation of UK plan assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both CAT and HON experienced a decrease in expected return on plan assets, which contributed to higher pension expenses or lower pension income. For CAT, the 20 basis point drop directly increased pension costs, while for HON, a similar decline in asset returns reduced pension income."

The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets caused by a change in allocation of UK plan assets and higher interest costs caused by increased discount rates in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2022, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.\n\nAsbestos  Related  Liabilities  and  Insurance  Recoveries -In  connection  with  the  recognition  of  liabilities  for  asbestos  related matters,  we  record  asbestos  related  insurance  recoveries  that  are  deemed  probable.  In  assessing  the  probability  of  insurance recovery,  we  make  judgments  concerning  insurance  coverage  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  and  consistent  with  our  historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.\n\nOur  involvement  in  asbestos  related  personal  injury  actions  relates  to  two  predecessor  companies.  Regarding  North  American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for the resolution of asserted NARCO-related asbestos claims which qualify for payment under the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims)  and  for  amounts  owed  pursuant  to  settlement  agreements  reached  during  the  pendency  of  the  NARCO  bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims) using average payment values for the relevant historical  period.  We  estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for unasserted claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Our estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological  disease  projection  through  2059  based  on  historic  and  anticipated  claims  filing  experience  and  dismissal  rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year.\n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.",

      "answer": "The Medicare Part D subsidy reduced HON's expected benefit payments for other postretirement benefits by $2 million in 2022 (from $27 million to $25 million). This subsidy likely influenced CAT's strategy to allocate 70% of its other postretirement benefit plan assets to equities and 30% to fixed income, as the subsidy reduces the net liability and may allow for a more growth-oriented investment approach.",

Plan assets\n\nIn  general,  our  strategy  for  both  the  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  pensions  includes  ongoing  alignment  of  our  investments  to  our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 85 percent fixed income and 15 percent equities. We will revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension  weighted-average  target  allocations  are  82  percent  fixed  income,  10  percent  equities,  5  percent  real  estate  and  3 percent  other.    The  target  allocations  for  each  plan  vary  based  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  demographics  of  plan participants and funded status.  We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in non-U.S. securities.\n\nOur target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.\n\nWe rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis.  The frequency of rebalancing  for  the  non-U.S.  plans  varies  depending  on  the  plan. As  a  result  of  our  diversification  strategies,  there  are  no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\n\nWe permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives.  The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\n\nThe accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.",

      "answer": "CAT excluded all restructuring costs from segment profit in 2021, which suggests a methodological difference in how segment profit was calculated compared to prior years and relative to HON. HON reported a 13% increase in segment profit from $1,099 million in 2020 to $1,238 million in 2021. This increase may have been influenced by how HON accounted for restructuring costs, which were not excluded from segment profit in the same way as CAT. Therefore, the treatment of restructuring costs in 2021 likely contributed to a cleaner or more favorable segment profit figure for CAT, while HON's increase of 13% reflects a calculation that may have included such costs, making the year-over-year comparison between the two companies more complex due to differing accounting practices.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of restructuring costs in segment profit differ between Caterpillar (CAT) in 2021 and Honeywell (HON), and what specific costs are excluded by CAT from segment profit that may still be included under HON's segment profit definition?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar (CAT) excluded all restructuring costs from segment profit in 2021, including costs related to accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, equipment relocation, and building demolition. In contrast, Honeywell (HON) defines segment profit to exclude items such as repositioning and other charges, but does not explicitly state a blanket exclusion of all restructuring costs. Therefore, some restructuring-related expenses that CAT excludes entirely may still be included in HON's segment profit depending on how they are categorized.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Caterpillar (CAT) explicitly states that in 2021, all restructuring costs were excluded from segment profit, including specific costs like accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, equipment relocation, and building demolition.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Honeywell (HON) defines segment profit as excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest, stock compensation, pension costs, repositioning and other charges, and other items in Other (income) expense, but does not specify a full exclusion of all restructuring costs.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: CAT takes a stricter approach by excluding all restructuring costs from segment profit in 2021, while HON\u2019s definition allows for potential inclusion of some restructuring costs unless they fall under 'repositioning and other charges.'"

      "question": "How much greater was the negative cash impact of inventory changes in 2021 for Caterpillar (CAT) compared to Honeywell (HON), and what does this indicate about their respective inventory management pressures during that year?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's negative cash impact from inventory changes in 2021 was $2,586 million, while Honeywell's was $685 million. The difference between the two was $1,901 million. This indicates that Caterpillar faced significantly higher inventory buildup or procurement pressures in 2021 compared to Honeywell, which may reflect differences in supply chain dynamics, production cycles, or demand forecasting between the two industrial companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Caterpillar's 2021 change in inventories was a cash outflow of $2,586 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Honeywell's 2021 change in inventories was a cash outflow of $685 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference: $2,586 million - $685 million = $1,901 million.",
        "Step 4: Interpret the result in terms of inventory management pressure, noting that a larger negative number indicates a larger increase in inventory levels or slower inventory turnover."

      "answer": "In 2021, CAT reported a net loss on foreign currency translation of $600 million, which contributed to its other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, of $598 million. In contrast, HON experienced a positive 1% impact from foreign currency translation in 2021 compared to 2020. The combined effect of these two FX translation impacts was a total negative $597 million when CAT's $598 million loss is considered alongside HON\u2019s 1% FX gain, which, although not in dollar terms, indicates a favorable movement for HON.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source CAT_10k_2022.pdf: CAT's net loss on foreign currency translation for 2021 was $600 million, contributing to its other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, of $598 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source HON_10k_2022.pdf: HON's 2021 vs. 2020 performance included a 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While CAT experienced a significant negative impact from FX translation, HON benefited slightly. Combining CAT's $598 million loss with HON's 1% FX gain (qualitatively indicating a positive shift) results in a net negative comprehensive income impact of approximately $597 million when considering CAT\u2019s full reported loss."

      "answer": "CAT reported accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits of $2,757 million in 2023, while UNP reported accrued wages of $50 million in the same year. This significant difference suggests that CAT likely has a much larger workforce or different payroll timing compared to UNP, which could impact their respective short-term liabilities and cash flow management.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CAT's accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits for 2023 is $2,757 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNP's accrued wages for 2023 is $50 million.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two figures to assess the scale difference in accrued wages between the two companies.",
        "Step 4: Infer potential causes for this difference, such as workforce size, compensation levels, or payroll cycle timing."

      "answer": "The combined net deferred income tax liability related to property and operating leases for CAT and UNP in 2023 is $13,000 million. This is calculated by summing CAT\u2019s property-related deferred tax liability of $12,987 million and UNP\u2019s net deferred income tax liability of $13,123 million, and then subtracting UNP\u2019s operating lease deferred tax asset of $394 million, as operating lease liabilities create temporary differences that reduce tax obligations.",

      "answer": "CAT eliminates prepaid insurance premiums related to Financial Products in its intercompany transactions, indicating internal risk transfer mechanisms. Meanwhile, UNP notes that events like terrorism or war could significantly increase its insurance premiums. The interplay shows that while CAT manages some insurance costs internally through intercompany structures, UNP remains externally exposed to volatile insurance markets due to operational risks, highlighting different strategies for managing insurance cost exposure in the Industrials sector.",

        "Step 1: From CAT's 10-K, we learn that 'Elimination of ME&T's insurance premiums that are prepaid to Financial Products' occurs in intercompany transactions, showing internal risk financing.",

      "question": "What is the total amount of Company contributions made by CAT and UNP in 2023 for their respective employee benefit plans, and how does this reflect their differing approaches to employee compensation and benefits?",
      "answer": "CAT contributed $44 million to U.S. pension benefits and $66 million to Non-U.S. pension benefits in 2023, while UNP contributed 40% of employee contributions to its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), with a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually). This results in CAT's total pension contributions being $110 million, whereas UNP's matching contributions depend on employee participation but are capped annually. These figures show CAT focuses more on pension funding, while UNP emphasizes stock-based compensation incentives.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - CAT's 2023 U.S. Pension Benefits contribution is $44 million and Non-U.S. Pension Benefits contribution is $66 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - UNP matches 40% of employee contributions to its ESPP, with a maximum employee contribution of 5% of monthly salary (limited to $15,000 annually).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Add CAT's U.S. and Non-U.S. pension contributions ($44M + $66M = $110M) and describe UNP's contribution mechanism, which is based on employee participation and capped at $15,000 annually per employee.",
        "Step 4: Analyze - The differing approaches reflect CAT's traditional pension funding strategy versus UNP's incentive-based stock purchase plan."

      "answer": "CAT's 2023 capital expenditure was $1.66 billion, and it expects to increase this to between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in 2024. This upward trend in capital spending indicates a strategic emphasis on growth through expanded offerings, services, and sustainability, including potential acquisitions. In contrast, UNP highlights leadership roles such as Jennifer L. Hamann as Chief Financial Officer and Rahul Jalali as Chief Information Officer, suggesting a focus on financial discipline and technological infrastructure to support long-term operational efficiency.

The total difference between the two companies' net deferred income tax positions is $15,303 million.

      "answer": "Caterpillar discloses that it accrues remediation costs when it is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and is engaged in remedial activities at multiple locations, often with other companies. Union Pacific states that it maintains adequate reserves for environmental liabilities but acknowledges that fluctuations in potential costs affect estimates, and actual costs may vary significantly due to regulatory changes, technological advances, and third-party participation. Both companies face material adverse effects from environmental obligations, but UNP emphasizes uncertainty in cost estimation more strongly, while CAT focuses on accrual practices.",

      "answer": "CAT accrues environmental remediation costs against earnings when it is probable that the company will pay these costs and they can be reasonably estimated. This includes investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs. In contrast, UNP accrues the cost of remediation only where its obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated, but it does not discount environmental liabilities when the timing of anticipated payments is not fixed or readily determinable. This shows that while both companies recognize remediation costs when probable and estimable, CAT explicitly includes a broader set of cost categories and recognizes them against earnings, whereas UNP emphasizes the non-discounting of liabilities due to uncertain timing.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, CAT accrues investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against earnings when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar Inc. reported $3,123 million in 'Other Current Liabilities' as of December 31, 2023, while Union Pacific Corporation reported $460 million under 'Other' within its current liabilities. This results in a combined total of $3,583 million in 'Other Current Liabilities'. Caterpillar's total current liabilities were $34,728 million, and Union Pacific's total accounts payable and other current liabilities were $3,683 million. Therefore, the 'Other Current Liabilities' portion represents approximately 8.9% of Caterpillar\u2019s total current liabilities and approximately 12.5% of Union Pacific\u2019s total accounts payable and other current liabilities.",

      "question": "How does the U.S. Government's preference for progress payments, as mentioned by Lockheed Martin, potentially affect the cash flow dynamics for companies like FedEx when both operate under fixed-price contracts?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin notes that the U.S. Government prefers progress payments for fixed-price contracts, which allow billing based on a percentage of costs incurred, and in March 2020, the DoD increased the progress payment rate from 80% to 90%. This policy impacts cash flow predictability for contractors like Lockheed, as progress payments may differ in timing from incurred costs. FedEx, which has $1.3 billion in deposits and progress payments on aircraft purchases and related transactions, could experience similar cash flow dynamics under fixed-price contracts if it were subject to the same payment terms. The alignment of payment timing with cost incurrence becomes critical for both companies to maintain liquidity and meet financial obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Lockheed Martin mentions that the U.S. Government prefers progress payments on fixed-price contracts, with a 90% billing rate on costs incurred (increased from 80% in March 2020).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Progress payments may differ in timing from costs incurred, affecting cash flows.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - FedEx has $1.3 billion in deposits and progress payments related to aircraft purchases and other transactions.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - If FedEx operates under fixed-price contracts similar to those of Lockheed Martin, its cash flow could be affected in the same way if progress payment terms are applied, as payment timing may not align with incurred costs."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Space's 2022 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit levels from 2021 primarily driven by the renationalization of  the  AWE  and  lower  volume  on  OPIR/SBIRS  due  to  program  lifecycles,  partially  offset  by  growth  on  the  NGI  program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single-digit level from 2021. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels.\n\n## Liquidity and Cash Flows\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other  trade  finance  purposes  such  as  guaranteeing  our  performance  on  particular  contracts.  We  believe  our  cash  and  cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.\n\nCash  received  from  customers,  either  from  the  payment  of  invoices  for  work  performed  or  for  advances  from  non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.\n\nBilling  timetables  and  payment  terms  on  our  contracts  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  contract  type. We generally bill  and  collect  cash  more  frequently  under  cost-reimbursable  contracts,  which  represented  approximately  38%  of  the sales we recorded in 2021, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for  performance-based  payments,  which  allow  us  to  bill  and  collect  cash  as  we  perform  on  the  contract.  The  amount  of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.\n\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price  contracts,  rather  than  performance-based  payments.  In  contrast  to  negotiated  performance-based  payment  terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. In March 2020, the DoD increased the percentage rate for certain progress payments from 80% to 90%. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments  on  our  billings.  While  the  impact  of  policy  changes  or  withholding  payments  may  delay  the  receipt  of  cash,  the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.\n\nWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, and our pension obligations. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust.\n\nIn September 2021, our Board of Directors increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.80 per share and approved a $5.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  the  'Business  Overview'  section  above,  on  December  20,  2020,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne's then-projected net cash and are awaiting a final FTC decision. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. Please see the 'Business Overview' above for the status of the transaction.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company  for  approximately  18,000  U.S.  retirees  and  beneficiaries.  The  group  annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding",

Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin disclosed having contractual commitments covering debt repayments, operating leases, and purchase agreements as of December 31, 2021, which constrain its financial flexibility across multiple liability categories.

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's active management of debt levels, including financing plans for the $4.4 billion Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition through new debt issuances, and its pension liability reduction through $4.9 billion in group annuity contracts, could increase its short-term borrowing in capital markets. This could make Lockheed Martin more sensitive to rising interest rates and shifts in credit availability. FedEx, being in a capital-intensive and highly cyclical industry, is already directly impacted by macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and credit availability. If Lockheed Martin\u2019s increased debt load leads to tighter credit conditions or reduced liquidity in the broader market, it could indirectly affect FedEx\u2019s ability to access capital at favorable terms, especially during periods of economic slowdown or volatility, thereby heightening its operational and financial risk profile.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Market Risks\n\nWe are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. While macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. The transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade - key macroeconomic measurements influenced by, among other things, inflation and deflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates and currency exchange rates, labor costs and unemployment levels, fuel and energy prices, public health crises, inventory levels, buying patterns and disposable income, debt levels, and credit availability. When individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances. Certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments. Additionally, consumer spending has shifted from goods to services. We expect these trends to continue. Further, we have a relatively high fixedcost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels.\n\nMoreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets, and geopolitical risks such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have suspended all services in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, which has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our business or results of operations. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including us, as a result of the suspension of services in Russia, including nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict's effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\nTo the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our FedEx Express international business; disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand; terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty negatively impacted operations at FedEx Express in 2022. We expect slowing economic conditions during 2023. Additionally, we incurred higher costs due to labor market challenges in 2022, and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2023. For more information, see 'Our failure to attract and retain employee talent or maintain our company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.' below and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Trends\n\nWe expect Space's 2022 net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit levels from 2021 primarily driven by the renationalization of  the  AWE  and  lower  volume  on  OPIR/SBIRS  due  to  program  lifecycles,  partially  offset  by  growth  on  the  NGI  program. Operating profit is expected to decrease in the high single-digit level from 2021. Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels.\n\n## Liquidity and Cash Flows\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other  trade  finance  purposes  such  as  guaranteeing  our  performance  on  particular  contracts.  We  believe  our  cash  and  cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans.\n\nCash  received  from  customers,  either  from  the  payment  of  invoices  for  work  performed  or  for  advances  from  non-U.S. Government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. However, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.\n\nBilling  timetables  and  payment  terms  on  our  contracts  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  contract  type. We generally bill  and  collect  cash  more  frequently  under  cost-reimbursable  contracts,  which  represented  approximately  38%  of  the sales we recorded in 2021, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for  performance-based  payments,  which  allow  us  to  bill  and  collect  cash  as  we  perform  on  the  contract.  The  amount  of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.\n\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price  contracts,  rather  than  performance-based  payments.  In  contrast  to  negotiated  performance-based  payment  terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. In March 2020, the DoD increased the percentage rate for certain progress payments from 80% to 90%. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments  on  our  billings.  While  the  impact  of  policy  changes  or  withholding  payments  may  delay  the  receipt  of  cash,  the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary.\n\nWe have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. We have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, and our pension obligations. We expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust.\n\nIn September 2021, our Board of Directors increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by $0.20 to $2.80 per share and approved a $5.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  the  'Business  Overview'  section  above,  on  December  20,  2020,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne for approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne's then-projected net cash and are awaiting a final FTC decision. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. Please see the 'Business Overview' above for the status of the transaction.\n\nOn August 3, 2021, we purchased group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and  related  plan  assets  to  an  insurance  company  for  approximately  18,000  U.S.  retirees  and  beneficiaries.  The  group  annuity contracts were purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding",

      "question": "What was the total company contribution in 2022 across U.S. Pension Plans for FDX and Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans for LMT, and how does this combined contribution compare to the unfunded status of these plans at the end of the year?",
      "answer": "The total company contribution in 2022 was $533 million for FDX's U.S. Pension Plans and $0 for LMT's Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans, resulting in a combined contribution of $533 million. Meanwhile, the unfunded status of these plans at the end of the year was $2,732 million for FDX and $8,255 million for LMT, totaling $10,987 million. This indicates that the combined contributions covered only about 4.85% of the total unfunded status across both companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - FDX's U.S. Pension Plan company contribution in 2022 was $533 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - LMT's Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan company contribution in 2022 was $0.",
        "Step 3: Sum contributions - $533 million (FDX) + $0 (LMT) = $533 million total company contributions.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source A - FDX's U.S. Pension Plan unfunded status at the end of 2022 was $2,732 million.",
        "Step 5: Extract from source B - LMT's Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan unfunded status at the end of 2022 was $8,255 million.",
        "Step 6: Sum unfunded status - $2,732 million (FDX) + $8,255 million (LMT) = $10,987 million total unfunded status.",
        "Step 7: Calculate coverage - $533 million (contributions) / $10,987 million (unfunded status) = ~4.85% coverage."

          "chunk_text": "\n## LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\n\nIn response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the 'Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A, we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation in a challenging macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, labor availability and supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, rising fuel prices, and geopolitical conflicts. We had $6.9 billion in cash at May 31, 2022 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the 'Five-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the 'Three-Year Credit Agreement' and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the 'Credit Agreements'), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.\n\nWe expect to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock in 2023.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2022 includes $2.9 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\nOur 2023 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2022 at approximately $6.8 billion. We expect increased investment in replacement vehicles including our vehicle electrification initiative, information technology, and strategic investments aimed to optimize operations across our networks to be offset with lower aircraft fleet modernization spend. Included within our expected 2023 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. Our expected capital expenditures for 2023 also include $1.7 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. While we continue to invest in our business, the capital intensity relative to revenue is expected to remain below historical levels.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 7, Note 8, and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nThe Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.",

(a)\n\nThe impact of our postretirement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to fluctuate. Accordingly, our net earnings were affected by a net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $668 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $1.0 billion in 2018, and $876 million in 2017. We made no pension contributions in 2021, $1.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019, $5.0 billion in 2018, and $46 million in 2017. These contributions caused fluctuations in our operating cash flows and cash balance between each of those years. See 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. (b)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders' equity. (c)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include unrealized gains of $265 million ($199 million, or $0.72 per share, after-tax) due to changes in the fair value of investments held in the Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. (d)\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, operating profit includes noncash asset impairment charges of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, after-tax) and $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) related to our equity method investee, (e)",

Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Expense is based on assumptions in effect at the end of the preceding year.

      "question": "How do the actuarial gains and losses impact the financial reporting of retirement plan obligations for FDX and LMT, and what specific amounts from each company's 10-K filings demonstrate this accounting treatment?",
      "answer": "FDX uses mark-to-market (MTM) accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses related to its defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans, which results in the immediate recognition of these gains and losses in earnings rather than deferring them in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). This approach directly affects the company's income statement by incorporating any actuarial gains or losses annually. LMT, on the other hand, measures its defined benefit pension obligations using significant actuarial assumptions, including changes in service cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, new longevity assumptions, and plan amendments. LMT\u2019s audit procedures specifically evaluate these actuarial gains and losses as part of the pension obligation calculation, ensuring that the methodology and assumptions align with historical trends and are accurate. Both companies incorporate actuarial gains and losses directly into their financial reporting, but LMT\u2019s process includes a more detailed audit review of these assumptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - FDX uses MTM accounting for actuarial gains and losses related to its defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans, which means these gains and losses are immediately recognized in earnings.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LMT evaluates changes in actuarial gains and losses as part of its defined benefit pension obligation calculations, including the review of service cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, and longevity assumptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both FDX and LMT incorporate actuarial gains and losses into their financial reporting, but the mechanisms differ: FDX recognizes them immediately in earnings under MTM accounting, while LMT subjects its actuarial assumptions to rigorous internal and external audit procedures to ensure accuracy and alignment with historical trends."

We classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense and, if applicable, penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The balance of accrued interest and penalties was $55 million on May 31, 2022 and $61 million on May 31, 2021. Our consolidated statements of income for 2021 include $20 million of interest expense associated with our uncertain tax positions while interest and penalty expense for 2022 and 2020 are immaterial.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions. Changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits, appeals, or litigation in state, local, federal, and foreign tax jurisdictions, or from the resolution of various proceedings between U.S. and foreign tax authorities. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, estimates of the amounts or ranges for individual matters where a material change is reasonably possible cannot be made. We believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax reserves, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments that may occur.\n\n## NOTE 14: RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. These programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans.\n\nThe accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and the recognition in either expense or AOCI of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. We use MTM accounting for the recognition of our actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plans as described in Note 1. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the PBO of the plan.\n\nA summary of our retirement plan costs over the past three years is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

For example, we tested the internal controls over management's review of the defined benefit pension  obligation  calculations,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  and  the  data  inputs  provided  to  the actuaries.\n\nTo test the defined benefit pension obligation, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above and the underlying data used by the Corporation. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the  change  in  the  defined  benefit  pension  obligation  from  prior  year  due  to  the  change  in  service  cost, interest cost, benefit payments, settlements, actuarial gains and losses, new longevity assumptions and plan amendments.  In  addition,  we  involved  our  actuarial  specialists  to  assist  in  evaluating  management's methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to the prior year and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash  flows.  To  evaluate  longevity,  we  evaluated  management's  selection  of  mortality  base  tables  and improvement  scales,  adjusted  for  entity-specific  factors.  Lastly,  we  also  tested  the  completeness  and accuracy  of  the  underlying  data,  including  the  participant  data  provided  to  the  Corporation's  actuarial specialists.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1994.\n\nTysons, Virginia January 25, 2022",

      "question": "How do FedEx's strategic investments in network optimization and Lockheed Martin's strategic investments in early-stage technology companies differ in terms of financial allocation and intended business impact?",
      "answer": "FedEx allocated $6.8 billion in 2023 for capital expenditures, including strategic investments aimed at optimizing operations across its networks, such as $1.5 billion each for the FedEx Express Indianapolis and Memphis hubs, and $1.7 billion for aircraft delivery and progress payments. These investments are intended to modernize infrastructure and improve fuel efficiency, leading to long-term operating savings. In contrast, Lockheed Martin makes strategic investments through its Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund in early-stage companies developing new technologies applicable to its business, with most investments being in equity securities without readily determinable fair values. These investments are intended to foster innovation aligned with Lockheed Martin\u2019s long-term strategic goals, rather than direct operational optimization. Thus, FedEx focuses on physical infrastructure and logistics efficiency, while Lockheed Martin emphasizes technology development and innovation partnerships.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\n\nIn response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the 'Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A, we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation in a challenging macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, labor availability and supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, rising fuel prices, and geopolitical conflicts. We had $6.9 billion in cash at May 31, 2022 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the 'Five-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the 'Three-Year Credit Agreement' and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the 'Credit Agreements'), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.\n\nWe expect to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock in 2023.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2022 includes $2.9 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\nOur 2023 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2022 at approximately $6.8 billion. We expect increased investment in replacement vehicles including our vehicle electrification initiative, information technology, and strategic investments aimed to optimize operations across our networks to be offset with lower aircraft fleet modernization spend. Included within our expected 2023 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. Our expected capital expenditures for 2023 also include $1.7 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. While we continue to invest in our business, the capital intensity relative to revenue is expected to remain below historical levels.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 7, Note 8, and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nThe Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInventories -  We  record  inventories  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  value.  The  majority  of  our  inventory represents work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. In addition, costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded  are  recorded  in  inventories  as  work-in-process  if  we  determine  that  those  costs  relate  directly  to  a  contract  or  to  an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services  to  the  customer  upon  the  receipt  of  the  anticipated  contract. All  other  pre-contract  costs,  including  start-up  costs,  are expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in firstout or average cost methods. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that precontract costs are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.\n\nContract liabilities -  Contract  liabilities  include  advance  payments  and  billings  in  excess  of  revenue  recognized.  Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straightline method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. No depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment was $904 million in 2021, $853 million in 2020 and $794 million in 2019.\n\nWe  review  the  carrying  amounts  of  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  if  events  or  changes  in  the  facts  and  circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash  flows  of  the  related  asset  grouping  to  its  carrying  amount.  If  an  asset  is  determined  to  be  impaired,  we  recognize  an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.\n\nCapitalized software - We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from two to six years. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, capitalized software totaled $777 million and $686 million, net of accumulated amortization of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $175 million in 2021, $166 million in 2020 and $111 million in 2019.\n\nFair  value  of  financial  instruments -  We  measure  the  fair  value  of  our  financial  instruments  using  observable  and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.\n\n- Level 3 - unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nInvestments - Substantially all assets measured at fair value represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our investments held in trust totaled $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nNet gains on these securities were $205 million, $231 million and $233 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align  the  classification  of  changes  in  the  market  value  of  investments  held  for  the  plan  with  changes  in  the  value  of  the corresponding plan liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, through our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make strategic investments in certain early stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments may be in the form of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt securities or investments in funds. Most of the investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there  is  an  observable  price  change  or  reduced  for  impairment,  if  applicable.  Investments  with  quoted  market  prices  in  active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The carrying amounts of investments",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since both companies report either immaterial or no impact from participating securities on net earnings, this explains why LMT's earnings per share figures show no dilution despite high net earnings."

      "answer": "In 2021, Lockheed Martin's net earnings were significantly impacted by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax) and unrealized gains of $265 million ($199 million after-tax) from changes in the fair value of investments. These items directly influenced its earnings per share and financial performance. In contrast, FedEx reported that net earnings available to participating securities were immaterial in all periods presented, indicating that such securities had no meaningful effect on FedEx's net earnings in 2021. This highlights a stark contrast in how the two companies' net earnings were affected by specific financial events and structures during the same fiscal year.",

(a)\n\nThe impact of our postretirement benefit plans can cause our operating profit, net earnings, cash flows and certain amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to fluctuate. Accordingly, our net earnings were affected by a net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $668 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.5 billion in 2019, $1.0 billion in 2018, and $876 million in 2017. We made no pension contributions in 2021, $1.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019, $5.0 billion in 2018, and $46 million in 2017. These contributions caused fluctuations in our operating cash flows and cash balance between each of those years. See 'Critical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. (b)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders' equity. (c)\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations in 2021 include unrealized gains of $265 million ($199 million, or $0.72 per share, after-tax) due to changes in the fair value of investments held in the Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.6 billion ($5.81 per share) in 2021 and $1.5 billion ($5.33 and $5.29 per share)  in  2020  and  2019.  We  recognized  net  sales  from  performance  obligations  satisfied  in  prior  periods  of  approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\n\nWe have  experienced  performance  issues  on  a  classified  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  that  involves  highly  complex design  and  systems  integration  at  our  Aeronautics  business  segment.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  completed  a comprehensive  review  and  negotiation  of  scope  of  the  program  with  our  customer,  including  the  technical  requirements, performance to date, remaining work, schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program. At the conclusion of the review, we determined that the total costs to complete the current phase of the program would exceed the contract price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a loss of $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after tax) on the program at our Aeronautics business segment, which represented our estimated total losses on the current phase of the program. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the contract with our customer to modify the contract scope and price. The terms of the amendment are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  loss  recognized  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021.  Therefore,  our  current estimated loss remains at $225 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule  and  certain  milestones.  We  will  monitor  the  recoverability  of  precontract  costs,  which  could  be  impacted  by  the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nWe are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. Cumulative losses on this program were approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. As  of  December  31,  2021,  cumulative  losses  remained  at  approximately  $260  million.  We  continue  to  monitor  program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.",

      "answer": "FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022, which were specifically tied to workforce reductions in Europe and were managed through a structured program with expected future costs of approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. These costs were directly linked to operational restructuring and were disclosed with specific estimates and timelines. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies focuses on legal proceedings, where reserves are established based on U.S. GAAP assessments of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. Lockheed Martin does not provide specific dollar amounts for these contingencies, indicating uncertainty in predicting the materiality of potential costs, especially due to evolving legal and regulatory environments. This reflects a more conservative and reactive strategy for managing unpredictable liabilities compared to FedEx's proactive and quantifiably planned approach to known restructuring costs.",

The timing and volume of repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on the capital needs of the business, the market price of FedEx common stock, and general market conditions. No time limits were set for the completion of the program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nDIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE. On June 14, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 11, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 27, 2022. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\n\nBUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS . In January 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan will impact approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business realignment activities of $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022. We incurred costs during 2021 of $116 million ($90 million, net of tax, or $0.33 per diluted share) associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Approximately $225 million was paid under this program in 2022 and $15 million in 2021. We expect the pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities to be approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectation and estimates.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include: self-insurance accruals; retirement plan obligations; long-term incentive accruals; tax liabilities; loss contingencies; litigation claims; impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows; and purchase price allocations.",

For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings along with 'Note 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\n## There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock.\n\nCash dividend payments and share repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements  and  cash  deployment  alternatives.  Our  payment  of  dividends  and  share  repurchases  could  vary  from  historical practices  or  our  stated  expectations.  Decreases  in  asset  values  or  increases  in  liabilities,  including  liabilities  associated  with employee benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders' equity. A deficit in stockholders' equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans may differ from stated expectations and is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available financing sources, our results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

      "answer": "FedEx applies significant management judgment in assessing loss contingencies, particularly due to the complexity of measuring contingent liabilities, which are subject to multiple unpredictable factors such as jurisdictional differences and evolving legal outcomes. FedEx's process involves legal and accounting personnel and external counsel, with regular quarterly evaluations and scheduled meetings before financial statement completion. In contrast, Lockheed Martin notes that while it follows U.S. GAAP in estimating loss contingencies and establishing reserves when liability is probable and estimable, it explicitly states that subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect its assessments, highlighting a dynamic and uncertain estimation process. Lockheed Martin also emphasizes the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and the potential financial impact of climate change-related legal actions, which adds another layer of uncertainty not specifically mentioned by FedEx.",

          "chunk_text": "Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021. This included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.\n\nThe market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\nOur reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2022 and 2021; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.\n\n## LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. Certain pending loss contingencies are described in Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in Note 19 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.\n\nBecause of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, and FedEx Ground's service providers. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a nonincome tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management's judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.\n\nDuring the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\nOur evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.",

Although the federal contractor vaccine mandate has been enjoined, we continue to encourage all employees to be vaccinated, including booster shots. We had  taken  steps  to  comply  with  the  federal  contractor  vaccine  mandate  across  our  workforce  until  it  was  enjoined. As  of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been vaccinated or received an approved exception. If the mandate is reinstated, or new mandates implemented, it is uncertain to what extent compliance with any such vaccine mandates may result in adverse impacts such as workforce attrition for us or our suppliers or reduce morale or efficiency. If the adverse impact is significant for us or our suppliers, our operations and ability to execute on our contracts could be adversely affected.\n\nThe  ultimate  impact  of  COVID-19  on  our  operations  and  financial  performance  in  future  periods,  including  our  ability  to execute  our  programs  in  the  expected  timeframe,  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  future  pandemic-related  developments, including  the  duration  of  the  pandemic,  potential  subsequent  waves  of  COVID-19  infection  or  potential  new  variants,  the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread,  including  the  implementation  of  any  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign  vaccine  mandates,  all  of  which  are uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  The  long-term  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  government  budgets  and  other  funding  priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future results and performance.\n\n## 2022 Financial Trends\n\nWe expect 2022 net sales to decrease by approximately 2% from 2021 levels. The projected decline is driven by declines at three of the four business areas (MFC, RMS, and Space). Specifically, these decreases are driven by the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Space, the 2021 delivery of a training system on an international pilot training program at RMS not projected to repeat in 2022, as well as a decrease in Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) volume at MFC due to withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Total business segment operating margin in 2022 is expected to be approximately 10.9% and cash from operations in 2022 is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.9 billion. Cash from  operations  assumes  no  pension  contributions;  and  includes  an  estimated  potential  impact  in  2022  of  approximately  $500 million from the provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect on January 1, 2022 eliminating the option to immediately  deduct  research  and  development  expenditures  in  the  period  incurred  and  requiring  companies  to  amortize  such expenditures over five years. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. See 'Income Tax Expense' below and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding potential impacts of changes in tax laws and regulations, including the treatment of research and development costs.\n\nThe outlook for 2022 also assumes continued support and funding of our programs, a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, known impacts of COVID-19, and the continued acceleration of supplier payments, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. No additional impacts to the company's operations, supply chain, or financial results as a result of continued COVID-19 disruption have been incorporated into our outlook for 2022 as the company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will continue to have. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our financial results remain uncertain and there can be no assurance that our underlying assumptions are correct. Additionally, the company's outlook for 2022 assumes that there will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S. Government will not operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in which new contract and program starts are restricted. It also does not incorporate the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. Changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2022 net sales, business segment operating margin, and cash flows.\n\nWe expect a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.3 billion in 2022 based on a 2.875% discount rate (a 37.5 basis point increase from the end of 2020), an approximate 10.5% return on plan assets in 2021, and a 6.50% expected long-term rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  in  future  years,  among  other  assumptions. We do not expect to make required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2022.\n\n## Portfolio Shaping Activities\n\nWe  continuously  strive  to  strengthen  our  portfolio  of  products  and  services  to  meet  the  current  and  future  needs  of  our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses that",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020; which is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP and reflects the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 discussed below.\n\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS govern the extent to which our  pension  costs  are  allocable  to  and  recoverable  under  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS.  Pension  cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.\n\nWe recovered $2.1 billion in 2021 and $2.0 billion in 2020 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension  costs  recovered  under  U.S.  Government  contracts  are  considered  to  be  prepayment  credits  under  the  CAS  rules.  Our prepayment credits were approximately $7.0 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eased funding requirements for  single-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans  under  ERISA,  as  amended,  by  restarting  and  extending  the  amortization  of funding shortfalls and extending and enhancing interest rate stabilization percentages, among many other stimulus measures. These changes have the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements and CAS pension costs from what they otherwise would have been had the measures not been enacted.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe  do  not  plan  to  make  contributions  to  our  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plans  in  2022.  We  anticipate  recovering approximately $1.8 billion of CAS pension cost in 2022 allowing us to recoup a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.\n\nWe project FAS pension income of $460 million in 2022 compared to FAS pension income of $265 million in 2021 and a net 2022 FAS/CAS pension benefit of $2.3 billion, which is comparable to the $2.3 billion in 2021. This excludes the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion (pretax) recognized in the third quarter of 2021 described above for comparison year over year.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $742 million and $789 million. We have recorded assets totaling $645 million and $685 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below.  The  amount  that  is  expected  to  be  allocated  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  to  not  be recoverable  under  U.S.  Government  contracts  is  expensed  through  cost  of  sales.  We  project  costs  and  recovery  of  costs  over approximately 20 years.\n\nWe enter into agreements (e.g. , administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our  environmental  remediation  obligations.  We  also  are  involved  in  environmental  remediation  activities  at  sites  where  formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually  span  many  years,  which  makes  estimating  the  costs  more  judgmental  due  to,  for  example,  changing  remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.\n\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable  that  the  liabilities  have  been  incurred  and  the  amounts  can  be  reasonably  estimated  (see  the  discussion  under 'Environmental  Matters'  in  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  and  'Note  15  -  Legal  Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g. , a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).",

      "answer": "The $249 million incremental intangibles amortization expense at EMR in 2023, stemming from the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, directly reduced earnings by that amount and caused the margin to decline by 3.1 percentage points to 11.6%. This contrasts with BA's approach, where finite-lived intangible assets\u2014such as developed technology (4\u201314 years), product know-how (6\u201330 years), and customer base (3\u201317 years)\u2014are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. This systematic amortization approach by BA affects financial reporting by gradually reducing earnings over time, rather than through a large, acquisition-driven spike in amortization expense like EMR experienced. The difference highlights how acquisition strategies and the associated intangible assets can significantly influence earnings performance and financial ratios across companies in the same sector.",

      "answer": "BA amortizes finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 to 32 years, depending on the asset type, which spreads the cost evenly over time and results in a predictable, steady impact on earnings. In contrast, EMR incurred a significant $560 million intangibles amortization expense in 2024 directly tied to the Test & Measurement acquisition, which had a material negative impact on gross margin by approximately 1.3 percentage points. This difference in amortization treatment means that EMR experienced a more immediate and concentrated financial impact on profitability compared to BA, which absorbs amortization more gradually.

      "question": "By how much did the acquisition-related intangibles amortization impact EMR's earnings in the Software and Control segment in 2024, and how does this compare with BA's accounting policy for finite-lived intangible assets from acquisitions?",
      "answer": "The acquisition-related intangibles amortization impacted EMR's earnings in the Software and Control segment by $560 million in 2024, which directly reduced earnings by that amount and caused the margin to decline by 6.4 percentage points. This aligns with BA's stated policy of amortizing finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology (4\u201314 years), product know-how (6\u201330 years), customer base (3\u201317 years), distribution rights (3\u201327 years), and other (1\u201332 years), on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. EMR's $560 million amortization expense reflects the same accounting treatment BA describes for acquired intangibles, which are amortized rather than expensed immediately.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From EMR\u2019s 10-K, we extract the specific impact of intangibles amortization: $560 million reduced earnings in the Software and Control segment in 2024.",
        "Step 2: From BA\u2019s 10-K, we extract the company\u2019s policy of amortizing finite-lived acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over specific ranges of years.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: EMR\u2019s $560 million amortization charge is consistent with BA\u2019s stated accounting policy for finite-lived intangibles, showing that both companies apply similar GAAP-based amortization practices post-acquisition."

      "answer": "BA excluded certain common shares from diluted loss per share calculations because their inclusion would have been antidilutive based on strike price or unmet performance conditions, indicating that performance conditions played a role in the exclusion. In contrast, EMR stated that an inconsequential number of shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share in 2023 because the effect would have been antidilutive, but it did not specifically tie these exclusions to performance conditions. This reveals that while both companies excluded antidilutive shares, BA explicitly linked the exclusion to performance conditions, whereas EMR treated the exclusions as minor and not performance-dependent.",

In contrast, Boeing's unbilled receivables related to commercial customer incentives collected after one year decreased significantly from $117 million in 2022 to $42 million in 2023, indicating a different trend in receivables management.

      "answer": "BA recognizes Unbilled Receivables (contract assets) when revenue is recognized before payments are received under long-term contracts, particularly with U.S. government customers who withhold a small portion of the contract price until completion. This results in contract assets that are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the company. In contrast, EMR explicitly summarizes the balances of its Unbilled Receivables in its financial statements, reporting them under Other Assets (both current and noncurrent), which directly affects asset classification and liquidity presentation. The difference in reporting mechanisms reflects BA's focus on performance obligations and internal estimation processes, while EMR emphasizes balance sheet categorization and transparency in its revenue recognition practices.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BA discusses Unbilled Receivables arising from revenue recognized before billing, particularly under long-term contracts with the U.S. government.",

      "answer": "Boeing's unbilled receivables balance decreased from ($23) million at the start of 2023 to ($19) million by the end of 2023, indicating a reduction of $4 million in unbilled receivables during the year. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) disclosed that its unbilled receivables (classified as contract assets) were reported in 'Other assets' and were part of its revenue recognition framework under ASC 606, though no specific balance figures were provided. The difference in reporting suggests that Boeing actively reduced its unbilled receivables during the year, while Emerson's disclosure focused more on the classification and accounting treatment of these receivables, indicating a difference in how each company managed or reported this financial metric.",

        "Step 1: Extract Boeing's unbilled receivables at the beginning and end of 2023 from evidence_source_a to calculate the change ($23 million to $19 million).",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Unbilled Receivables in Boeing's (BA) financial disclosures relate to the change in Unbilled Receivables reported by Emerson (EMR) from 2023 to 2024, and what does this imply about the recognition of contract assets across these industrial companies?",
      "answer": "Boeing (BA) states that Unbilled Receivables are excluded from fair value disclosures because their carrying value approximates fair value, indicating that these assets are relatively stable and predictable in value. Emerson (EMR) reports a specific increase in Unbilled Receivables from $1,453 million in 2023 to $1,599 million in 2024, showing a $146 million rise. This increase implies a growing amount of revenue recognized under contracts that have not yet been billed, suggesting that Emerson is performing work or delivering services ahead of billing. Boeing's treatment of Unbilled Receivables as having a carrying value that approximates fair value aligns with the idea that these receivables are not subject to significant valuation uncertainty, which supports Emerson's ability to report a clear increase in this metric year-over-year without needing to adjust for fair value discrepancies.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) updated its pension asset allocation strategy in 2023 with a modest increase to risk assets, aiming to reduce volatility relative to liabilities while achieving competitive returns and diversification. This change implies a potentially higher expected return due to the increased exposure to risk assets. Emerson (EMR), on the other hand, determines its expected return on plan assets by reviewing past returns over 10 years and longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating its allocation targets, and compares these with advisor expectations. Since both companies incorporate historical returns and advisor expectations, but Boeing has actively adjusted its allocation to include more risk assets, Boeing may expect a higher return on its pension assets compared to Emerson, assuming similar risk-return profiles in their respective asset mixes.",

This approach smooths out short-term market volatility over a defined historical window. In contrast, Emerson reviews investment returns for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating its allocation targets to determine the expected return on plan assets. This broader historical analysis may result in a more extended time horizon influencing its expected return assumption, potentially leading to a different sensitivity to market fluctuations compared to Boeing's shorter five-year averaging approach.",

      "answer": "Boeing's backlog adjustments due to a net decrease in 777X and 737 aircraft resulted in a $20,605 million increase to its backlog under ASC 606. This indicates potential volatility in aircraft delivery schedules and customer commitments, which may influence downstream industrial companies like Emerson. Emerson reported a total backlog of $8.4 billion, with $1.3 billion from AspenTech and $400 million from National Instruments. If Boeing experiences further delays or cancellations, especially in China or with new aircraft models, it could create broader supply chain or market demand effects that influence Emerson\u2019s industrial automation and software markets, potentially affecting its backlog realization expectations.",

      "answer": "Boeing's backlog is significantly influenced by its commercial aircraft orders, particularly from China, and is subject to risks from delays in aircraft delivery or worsening U.S.-China trade relations. Since China is a key market for Boeing and represents a large portion of its backlog, any disruptions could lead to order cancellations or reduced backlog. Emerson, also in the Industrials sector, reports a $135 backlog with a weighted average life of 1 year, suggesting shorter-term commitments. If Boeing's backlog were to decline due to trade tensions, it could signal broader sector weakness or reduced industrial demand, which could, in turn, impact Emerson\u2019s future backlog levels or stability, given their shared sector exposure and market interdependencies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Boeing's backlog is heavily influenced by commercial aircraft orders from China and potential delivery delays (e.g., 777X, 737-7, 737-10).",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Emerson reports a $135 backlog with a 1-year weighted average life, indicating short-term commitments.",

The acquisition of National Instruments added $150 million to EMR's contract liabilities, further shaping its financial obligations and revenue timing. Together, these figures show that BA's growing backlog suggests potential for future revenue growth, while EMR's revenue recognition is more closely tied to prior-period liabilities and acquisitions, affecting their respective financial strategies and liquidity positions.",

      "answer": "Boeing's 2023 backlog for 737 and 777X aircraft saw a net ASC 606 adjustment of $20,605 million due to a net decrease in those aircraft, signaling delivery delays or reduced customer commitment. This volatility in the aerospace sector, particularly around key models, likely increases risk for companies indirectly exposed through contracts or assets like Emerson\u2019s $310 million backlog intangible asset with a 3-year estimated useful life. If Emerson\u2019s backlog value is sensitive to sector-specific disruptions similar to Boeing\u2019s, the useful life could be shortened due to reduced predictability or cancellations, especially if aerospace demand weakens.

      "answer": "Boeing's (BA) 2023 backlog increased to $440,507 million from $329,824 million, driven by new orders exceeding deliveries and net ASC 606 adjustments, despite $12,925 million in cancellations. This reflects a dynamic and risk-sensitive accounting quantity estimation process that factors in geopolitical events, customer payment probabilities, and delivery timelines, especially for programs like the 777X and 737-10. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) reports backlog at $135 million with a weighted average life of 1 year, indicating a much shorter-term and likely less volatile treatment of backlog. The difference in magnitude and duration highlights how backlog is context-dependent: Boeing's backlog is a forward-looking revenue commitment with long-term delivery schedules and significant risk adjustments, while Emerson's shorter life suggests a near-term fulfillment horizon, likely reflecting different industry dynamics and accounting practices.",

      "answer": "Boeing (BA) faces significant backlog volatility due to its exposure to the Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and tariffs, could lead to order cancellations or delivery delays for aircraft like the 777X, 737-7, and 737-10. This creates uncertainty in their contractual backlog, which saw an increase in 2023 largely due to growth in BCA and BDS segments. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a useful life of 3 years, indicating a more stable and predictable revenue stream associated with backlog. This suggests that EMR is less directly impacted by geopolitical volatility compared to Boeing, whose backlog is more sensitive to external macroeconomic and political factors such as trade restrictions and customer delivery assumptions in China.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BA_10k_2023.pdf, Boeing's backlog is influenced by assumptions around aircraft deliveries to China and potential delays in new aircraft entry, such as the 777X and 737 MAX variants, making it sensitive to U.S.-China trade tensions.",
        "Step 2: From EMR_10k_2023.pdf, Emerson reports backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a 3-year useful life, indicating a structured and time-bound revenue recognition process.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Boeing's backlog is exposed to geopolitical risk, particularly from U.S.-China trade tensions, while Emerson\u2019s backlog is treated as a more stable, short-duration asset, suggesting differing levels of sensitivity to macroeconomic disruptions."

CAT expects to spend between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion, focusing on operational excellence and strategic growth initiatives, including sustainability efforts. UPS plans to spend approximately $4.5 billion, with 50% allocated to network enhancement projects and technology initiatives, including over $1.0 billion for environmental sustainability goals.

      "question": "What is the combined 2023 consolidated operating profit of CAT and UPS, and how does the percentage change in CAT's consolidated operating profit from 2022 to 2023 compare to the percentage change of UPS over the same period?",
      "answer": "The combined 2023 consolidated operating profit of CAT and UPS is $22,107 million ($12,966 million from CAT + $9,141 million from UPS). CAT's consolidated operating profit increased by 64% from 2022 to 2023, while UPS's consolidated operating profit decreased by 30.2% over the same period. This results in a differential of 94.2 percentage points between the two companies' operating profit performance.",

In contrast, UPS's adjusted operating profit decreased by $672 million. Caterpillar's adjusted operating margin improved from 15.4% to 20.5%, a 510 basis point increase, while UPS's adjusted operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 9.0%. Therefore, Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit was $4,618 million higher than UPS's decrease, and Caterpillar's margin improved by 510 basis points compared to UPS's 230 basis point decline.",
