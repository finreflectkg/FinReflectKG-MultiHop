      "answer": "Microsoft's Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, is central to its competitive strategy against Salesforce. Dynamics competes directly with Salesforce in providing customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. The shift to Dynamics 365 enhances Microsoft's offering by providing a more intelligent and integrated platform. Additionally, the integration with Power Apps and Power Automate strengthens this positioning by enabling greater customization and automation capabilities, which increase the platform's appeal to businesses seeking flexible and scalable CRM solutions.",

IBM, in its 10-K filing, discloses that it recognizes revenue for services ratably over the contract period when services are provided continuously. This suggests that both companies follow a similar revenue recognition principle for services under GAAP, but Oracle provides more detailed methods for different service types (fixed price vs. consumption-based), indicating a potentially more segmented service delivery and billing approach compared to IBM\u2019s more generalized continuous service model.",

Therefore,  revenues  for  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses\n\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in  time when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the  customer  to  download  and  use.  Revenues  from  usage-based  royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products\n\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are  accounted  for  as  a  combined  performance  obligation. The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\n\n## Revenue Recognition for Services\n\nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.\n\n## Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore,  our  products  and  services  are  generally  not  combined.  We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\n\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially  all  performance  obligations  except  cloud licenses  and  on-premise  licenses,  we  are  able  to  establish  the  SSP  based  on  the  observable  prices  of  products  or  services  sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net  fees  paid  by  the  customer  to  access  the  license.  We  are  unable  to  establish  the  SSP  for  our  cloud  licenses  and  on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues.",

In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Oracle  Corporation  as  of  May  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated June 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nJune 21, 2022",

      "question": "How does the disclosure of segment information in Apple's 2022 financial report differ in presentation from IBM's 2022 reference to its 2021 segment information, and what does this imply about their respective reporting approaches?",
      "answer": "Apple directly presents its segment information and geographic data in its 2022 10-K filing, including detailed financial metrics by reportable segment for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. In contrast, IBM does not include its segment information directly in the 2022 10-K but instead references its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, directing readers to pages 87 to 90 for segment details. This implies that Apple adopts a more integrated and self-contained reporting approach, while IBM relies on external incorporation by reference, potentially affecting accessibility of detailed segment data for analysts reviewing its 2022 filing alone.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Apple's 10-K explicitly includes segment information and geographic data in a table format covering 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in millions), indicating a comprehensive and current presentation of segment performance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - IBM's 2022 10-K does not include segment data directly but instead references its 2021 Annual Report, specifically pages 87 to 90, for segment information, showing a reliance on prior year disclosures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in disclosure methods suggests contrasting philosophies: Apple provides up-to-date, consolidated segment reporting within the current 10-K, whereas IBM cross-references past reports, which may indicate less emphasis on updating segment details or a preference for continuity with prior disclosures."

      "answer": "Apple disclosed specific deferred revenue realization timing for its segment reporting in 2022, stating that 64% of total deferred revenue ($12.4 billion) would be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years, and 2% in greater than three years. This level of detail allows stakeholders to understand the predictability and timing of revenue recognition across its segments. In contrast, IBM referenced segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or services but did not disclose specific timing or percentages for deferred revenue realization. This difference suggests that Apple provides more granular revenue timing insights in its segment reporting, while IBM's segment reporting appears less detailed in terms of revenue recognition schedules, potentially affecting transparency and financial forecasting for investors.",

          "chunk_text": "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact  the  Company's  stock  price,  materially  damage  commercial  relationships,  and  expose  the  Company  to  litigation  or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's ability to identify,  investigate  and  recover  from  incidents.  In  addition,  attacks  against  the  Company  and  its  customers  can  escalate  during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\n\nAlthough  malicious  attacks  perpetrated  to  gain  access  to  confidential  information,  including  personal  information,  affect  many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe  Company  has  implemented  systems  and  processes  intended  to  secure  its  information  technology  systems  and  prevent unauthorized  access  to  or  loss  of  sensitive  data,  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  unauthorized  access,  including  through  the  use  of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its vendors' employees or customers into disclosing  user  names,  passwords  or  other  sensitive  information,  which  can,  in  turn,  be  used  for  unauthorized  access  to  the Company's or its vendors' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally  contemplated  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations  and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate  return  on  capital,  potential  impairment  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  and  significant  write-offs.  Investment  and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The  Company's  retail  stores  have  required  and  will  continue  to  require  a  substantial  investment  and  commitment  of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company's retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company's more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company's retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe  Company's  retail  operations  are  subject  to  many  factors  that  pose  risks  and  uncertainties  and  could  adversely  impact  the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company's ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.",

Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms.

      "answer": "If IBM's brand reputation risks materialize\u2014such as through cybersecurity incidents, client disputes, or delivery failures\u2014it could reduce IBM's ability to attract and retain enterprise customers. Since IBM and Microsoft both serve commercial clients, a weakened IBM could lead to fewer joint opportunities or reduced trust in technology solutions involving Microsoft's products. Microsoft's Devices segment relies on attracting new customers and total PC shipments, so if IBM\u2019s tarnished reputation hampers its own customer acquisition, it could indirectly reduce a channel through which Microsoft might otherwise gain new Surface customers. This would negatively affect Microsoft's Devices growth, which is dependent on expanding into new categories and drawing in new clients through enterprise partnerships.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - If IBM, as a commercial technology partner, loses its ability to bring in new enterprise clients due to reputational damage, it could reduce Microsoft's opportunities to sell Surface devices through that channel, thus impacting growth."

Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.\n\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings.\n\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.\n\n## Devices\n\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed  to  help  organizations,  students,  and  consumers  be  more  productive.  Growth  in  Devices  is  dependent  on  total  PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories.\n\n## Gaming\n\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated  gaming  experiences.  We  continue  to  invest  in  new  gaming  studios  and  content  to  expand  our  IP  roadmap  and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\n\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both onand off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft's Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs,  consoles,  and  mobile  devices,  enabling  gamers  to  take  their  favorite  games  with  them  and  play  on  the  device  most convenient to them.\n\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices,  and  other  devices.  Xbox  is  designed  to  benefit  users  by  providing  access  to  a  network  of  certified  applications  and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is  determined  by  the  overall  active  user  base  through  Xbox  enabled  content,  availability  of  games,  providing  exclusive  game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.\n\n## Search and News Advertising\n\nOur  Search  and  news  advertising  business  is  designed  to  deliver  relevant  search,  native,  and  display  advertising  to  a  global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search queries.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  understand  intent,  and  match  intent  with  relevant  content  and advertiser offerings.\n\nOn June 6, 2022, we acquired Xandr, Inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital advertising solutions.\n\n## Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.",

      "question": "How does the recognition of service revenue by QCOM compare to IBM's disclosure practices in terms of contribution to total revenue, given QCOM's statement that service and software licensing revenues were each less than 5% of total revenues?",
      "answer": "QCOM recognizes service revenues as part of its broader revenue streams, with service and software licensing revenues each contributing less than 5% of total revenues. IBM, while disclosing its financial operations in its 10-K, does not provide a comparable percentage for service revenue within its overall revenue structure. Therefore, while QCOM provides a specific threshold for its service-related revenue, IBM's disclosures do not allow for a direct comparison in terms of quantifying the contribution of service revenue to total revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, QCOM recognizes service revenues and discloses that such revenues, along with licensing system software, were each less than 5% of total revenues.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, IBM discloses its financial operations and structure but does not specify a comparable figure or percentage for service revenue contributions.",
        "Step 3: The comparison hinges on the explicit quantification provided by QCOM and the absence of such data in IBM\u2019s disclosures, making a full comparative analysis incomplete without further IBM-specific data."

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and longlived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other services and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products. Licensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nLicense agreements that require payment of license fees contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated. Since we expect to expend efforts to develop and transfer updates to our licensed portfolio on an even basis, license fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement.

      "question": "How does the treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities impact IBM's and QCOM's respective abilities to manage future tax liabilities under changing international tax regulations?",
      "answer": "IBM highlights that changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with evolving international tax regulations such as those from the OECD, could adversely affect its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. This implies that if international tax frameworks shift, IBM may face higher effective tax rates or larger cash outflows due to revaluations of its deferred tax positions. Similarly, QCOM explicitly states that it uses the asset and liability method to account for deferred tax assets and liabilities, and it regularly reassesses the adequacy of its provision for income taxes in light of potential adjustments from tax authorities. Both companies rely on estimates and judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets, which means that changes in tax laws or interpretations could lead to increased liabilities for both. Therefore, the shared reliance on deferred tax asset and liability valuations makes both IBM and QCOM vulnerable to increased tax costs if international tax regulations become more stringent or less harmonized.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - IBM mentions that changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and evolving international tax regulations (e.g., OECD guidelines) could adversely affect its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - QCOM states that it uses the asset and liability method to account for deferred tax assets and liabilities and regularly reassesses the adequacy of its provision for income taxes in light of potential adjustments from tax authorities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both IBM and QCOM rely on estimates and judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets and the valuation of liabilities. As international tax regulations evolve, both companies face increased exposure to higher tax costs due to potential revaluations and audit outcomes."

As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of  cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the European Court of Justice decision in the Schrems II matter; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\nThe Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position.\n\nTax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\n\nThe Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.",

Share-based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amounts related to share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings. Litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigations in particular. Investigations by antitrust and trade regulation agencies are not conducted in a consistent manner across jurisdictions. Further, each country and agency has different sets of laws, rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, as well as different legal principles, theories and potential remedies, and some agencies may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goals. Depending on the jurisdiction, these investigations can involve non-transparent procedures under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theories or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency. Unlike in civil litigation in the United States, in foreign proceedings, we may not be entitled to discovery or depositions, allowed to cross-examine witnesses or confront our accusers. As a result, we may not be aware of, and may not be entitled to know, all allegations against us, or the information or documents provided to, or discovered or prepared by, the agency. Accordingly, we may have little or no idea what an agency's intent is with respect to liability, penalties or the timing of a decision. In many cases the agencies are given significant discretion, and any available precedent may have limited, if any, predictive value in their jurisdictions or other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices.\n\nIf there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceedings, we disclose such fact, and if reasonably estimable, we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings and revise our estimates and update our disclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our legal costs associated with defending ourself are recorded to expense as incurred.\n\nForeign Currency. Certain foreign subsidiaries use a local currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains or losses related to balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIncome Taxes. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We include interest and penalties related to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, within income tax expense. We classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. We recognize excess tax benefits and shortfall tax detriments associated with share-based awards in the consolidated statements of operations, as a component of income tax expense, when realized.\n\nOur income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the assessment of our income tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, including those related to special deductions such as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income), tax incentives, intercompany research and development cost-sharing arrangements, transfer pricing, tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions we have taken or that we plan to take on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

This implies that IBM's financial position is sensitive to global tax policy changes and valuation adjustments. In contrast, NVIDIA specifically discloses a valuation allowance of $907 million as of January 30, 2022, related to state and other deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized, indicating a more concrete financial impact from deferred tax treatment. This shows that while both companies are affected by deferred tax asset and liability valuations, IBM emphasizes potential future risks from policy shifts, whereas NVIDIA has already recorded a significant valuation allowance affecting its financials.",

As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of  cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the European Court of Justice decision in the Schrems II matter; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\nThe Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position.\n\nTax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\n\nThe Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.",

Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated  product  returns  at  the  time  revenue  is  recognized,  based  primarily  on  historical  return  rates.  However,  if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are  earmarked  for  market  segment  development  and  are  designed  to  support  our  partners'  activities  while  also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur  license  and  development  arrangements  with  customers  typically  require  significant  customization  of  our  IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a  single  performance  obligation  over  the  period  in  which  the  development  services  are  performed.  We  measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize  federal,  state  and  foreign  current  tax  liabilities  or  assets  based  on  our  estimate  of  taxes  payable  or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  complex  tax  laws.  Our  estimates  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets  that  management  determined  are  not  likely  to  be  realized  due  to  jurisdictional  projections  of  future  taxable income,  tax  attributes  usage  limitation  by  certain  jurisdictions,  and  potential  utilization  limitations  of  tax  attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities.

We  offer  tuition  reimbursement  programs  to  subsidize  educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\n\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous thirdparty platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.\n\n## Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\n\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company's future.  Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock  price  and  vests  over  time  to  retain  employees  while  simultaneously  aligning  their  interests  with  those  of  our stockholders.\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees' and their families' physical health, well-being and financial health,  including  401(k)  programs  in  the  U.S.,  statutory  pension  programs  outside  the  U.S.,  our  employee  stock purchase  program,  flexible  work  hours  and  time  off,  and  programs  to  address  mental  health,  stress,  and  timemanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\n\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\n\nOther efforts we have been or are undertaking include:\n\n- Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with minority-serving institutions and professional organizations;\n- Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;\n- Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;\n- Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and\n- Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\n\nAs  of  January  30,  2022,  our  global  workforce  was  80%  male,  19%  female,  and  1%  not  declared  and  6%  of  our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\n\n## Health and COVID-19\n\nWe support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while adhering to government guidelines.

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\n\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For  example,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  prohibit  us  from engaging  in  certain  business  practices.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,  contractors,  suppliers,  or agents  will  not  violate  policies,  controls,  and  procedures  that  we  have  designed  to  help  ensure  compliance  with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or  our  employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws,  rules  and  regulations  be  amended  or  expanded,  or  new  ones  enacted,  we  could  incur  materially  greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative  rule  making,  and  enforcement  activity  resulting  from  growing  public  concern  over  concentration  of economic power in corporations.\n\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such  as  tariffs,  import  or  export  regulations,  including  deemed  export  restrictions,  trade  and  economic  sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally  fulfill  our  contractual  obligations  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business.  For  example,  in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control measures, which have and could in the  future  result  in,  among  other  things,  severe  or  complete  restrictions  on  exports  to  and  other  commerce  and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia  or  other  regions  determined  to  be  supporting  Russia,  and  restrict  access  by  our  Russian  or  Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these  recent  sanctions  and  export  restrictions  imposed  by  the  United  States  and  foreign  government  bodies,  we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions  and  trade  restrictions,  our  employees,  contractors,  partners,  and  agents  may  take  actions  in  violations  of such  policies  and  applicable  law,  for  which  we  may  be  ultimately  held  responsible.  If  we  were  ever  found  to  have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact  our  operating  strategies,  product  demand,  access  to  global  markets,  hiring,  and  profitability.  The  increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products",

We  may  also  face  supply  constraints  caused  by  natural  disasters  or  other  events.  If  we  are  able  to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\n\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we  are  in  today,  we  have  placed  and  may  continue  to  place  non-cancellable  inventory  orders  in  advance  of  our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months' lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters  and  long-term  supply  and  capacity  needs.  However,  we  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict  when  such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if  there  is  a  partial  or  complete  reduction  in  long-term  demand  for  our  products  or  if  such  demand  is  served  by  our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\n\nWe  depend  on  third  parties  and  their  technology  to  manufacture,  assemble,  test,  package  or  design  our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.\n\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques.

We also rely on  third-party  software  development  tools  to  assist  us  in  the  design,  simulation  and  verification  of  new  products  or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n- lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n- failure  by  our  foundries  or  contract  manufacturers  to  procure  raw  materials  or  to  provide  adequate  levels  of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;",

      "answer": "Adobe (ADBE) faces competitive pressures from companies with greater resources, broader brand awareness, and larger customer bases, which could lead potential customers to choose competitors' products, harming Adobe\u2019s market share and ability to attract new customers. Meanwhile, IBM faces risks from emerging business models that may unfavorably impact demand for its products and services, and if it fails to anticipate and respond to changes in customer preferences, its client adoption rates and new customer acquisition could suffer. Together, these challenges suggest both companies may struggle to grow their new customer segments due to external market dynamics and internal strategic execution risks.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Adobe notes that competitors with greater resources and larger customer bases may attract potential customers, harming Adobe\u2019s market share and ability to attract new customers.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - IBM states that emerging business models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability, and failure to respond to customer preferences could reduce client adoption rates and hinder new customer acquisition.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Adobe and IBM face challenges in acquiring new customers due to competitive and market pressures. Adobe's risk stems from external competitive advantages, while IBM's stems from internal strategic alignment with evolving customer demands. Combined, these factors suggest a shared vulnerability in growing their new customer segments."

If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\n\nFinally, to the extent that the pandemic harms our business and results of operations, many of the other risks described in this 'Risk Factors' section may be heightened.\n\n## Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.\n\nThe  markets  for  our  products  and  services  are  characterized  by  intense  competition,  new  industry  standards,  evolving distribution  models,  limited  barriers  to  entry,  disruptive  technology  developments,  short  product  life  cycles,  customer  price sensitivity, global market conditions and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at  lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner,  meet  changing  customer  expectations  and  needs,  extend  our  core  technology  into  new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may harm our results of operations.\n\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section titled 'Competition' in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\n\n## If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\n\nConsumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. While we offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms, if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it  more  difficult  for  our  products  to  perform  or  may  require  significant  cost  to  adapt  our  solutions  to  such  devices  or  operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.\n\n## Introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.\n\nThe expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of factors,  including  our  continued  ability  to  innovate,  introduce  new  products  and  services  efficiently,  enhance  and  integrate  our products  and  services  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective  manner,  extend  our  core  technology  into  new  applications,  and  anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products and services with one another and other companies' offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed.\n\nThe introduction of, or limitations on, certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products rely on tracking, third-party cookies or other identifiers to help our customers more effectively advertise",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services.

Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

Simultaneously, if IBM cannot retain customer relationships from its own acquisitions, it may struggle to grow in this space, creating an opening for Adobe if it can maintain financial stability.

If  a  transition  among  data  centers  or  to  third-party  service  providers  encounters  unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our  delivery  of  products  and  services  to  customers  and  result  in  increased  costs  and  liabilities,  which  may  harm  our  operating results, reputation and our business.\n\nIt is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and time-intensive notification requirements.\n\nWe may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software (or that of a third-party service provider). If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages or performance issues could occur, which would impact our customers. Such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer dissatisfaction, or harm our business. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our systems, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers, and we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.\n\n## Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.\n\nMaintaining  the  security  of  our  products  and  services  is  a  critical  issue  for  us  and  our  customers.  Security  researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate our end points, information systems and network security measures. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, making it increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against them. Certain unauthorized parties have in the past managed, and may again in the future manage, to gain access to and misuse some of our systems and software, or that of our third-party service providers, in order to access the authentication, payment and personal information of our end users' and employees. In addition, cyber-attackers (which may include individuals or groups, as well as sophisticated groups such as nation-state and state-sponsored attackers, which can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits) also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

      "answer": "Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Adobe's products could lead to customer loss due to security concerns, as stated in their 2022 10-K filing, which mentions that 'actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us, and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services.' Similarly, IBM's 2022 10-K filing notes that 'if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers... could be impacted.' Both companies face risks where reputational damage from security or brand issues could reduce customer retention, thereby weakening their competitive positioning in the Information Technology sector. If both companies experience reputational damage simultaneously, the cumulative effect could be a shift in customer preference toward more secure or trusted competitors.",

Hardware, software and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties have contained and may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer's ability to operate or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate, mitigate, or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms,  malicious  software  programs  and  security  vulnerabilities  are  significant,  and  our  efforts  to  address  these  problems, including notifying affected parties, may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.\n\nOutside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive, personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. This existing risk is compounded given the COVID-19 pandemic, as we shifted nearly all of our workforce to more frequent work-fromhome  arrangements.  We  also  expect  to  resume  operations  in  our  offices  under  a  hybrid  model  where  a  large  portion  of  our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These actual and potential  breaches  of  our  security  measures  and  the  accidental  loss,  inadvertent  disclosure  or  unauthorized  dissemination  of proprietary  information  or  sensitive,  personal  or  confidential  data  about  us,  our  employees,  our  customers  or  their  end  users, including  the  potential  loss  or  disclosure  of  such  information  or  data  as  a  result  of  hacking,  fraud,  trickery  or  other  forms  of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time-intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, thereby requiring time and resources to mitigate these impacts. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services and store and process more data, including personal information.\n\nThese issues  affect  our  products  and  services  in  particular  because  cyber-attackers  tend  to  focus  their  efforts  on  popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. From time to time we have identified, and in the future we may identify other, vulnerabilities in some of our applications and services and those of our third-party service providers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security  vulnerabilities,  regularly  reviewing  our  service  providers'  security  controls,  reviewing  and  auditing  our  hosted  services against independent security control frameworks (such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), providing resources such as mandatory security  training  for  our  workforce  and  improving  our  incident  response  time,  but  security  vulnerabilities  cannot  be  totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough  to  prevent  cyber-attackers  from  gaining  unauthorized  access  into  our  systems  and  products.  Despite  our  preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security our customers require or that meet our independent security control certification requirements, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which  could  delay  adoption  of  new  technologies.  Moreover,  delayed  sales,  lower  margins  or  lost  customers  resulting  from disruptions  caused  by  cyber-attacks,  preventative  measures  or  failure  to  fully  meet  independent  security  control  certification requirements could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n\n## Some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.\n\nSales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform solutions and Enterprise Term License Agreements ('ETLAs') in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:\n\n- the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;\n- the  desire  of  organizations  to  undertake  significant  evaluation  processes  to  determine  their  technology  requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;",

As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer's system, it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier's product. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer's end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and new delivery methods. In addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.\n\nWe collect, use and store (collectively, 'process') a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation, certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those is the financial services or public sector, are likely to further exacerbate this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\n\n## We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturing processes, restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. In addition, complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

In addition, TSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.\n\nIf any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same extent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This has in the past damaged, and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers. This could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, payment of significant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and gross margin.\n\nFurther, any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize, including TSMC's supply of wafers to us, as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, water shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.\n\n## We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.\n\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. During fiscal year 2022, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. As certain materials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints, inflation, or other factors, any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. The supply constraints have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our customer relationships. Further, continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties.\n\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anticompetition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The U.S. government may also add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue. For example, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us to suspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. We may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the FTC. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) faces risks related to the expiration of patents, which removes competitive advantages and could reduce product demand. Additionally, AVGO relies on third-party software licenses to maintain compatibility, and any restrictions could increase R&D costs and delay product development. IBM similarly faces challenges in protecting its intellectual property, which could allow competitors to develop similar offerings, and its use of open-source software is vulnerable to discontinuation, which could hinder innovation and customer satisfaction. These combined issues at both companies could lead to reduced product demand across the IT sector due to decreased innovation, higher costs, and diminished competitive differentiation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AVGO 2022 10-K - 'When patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us' and 'If software providers and hardware manufacturers...impose unfavorable terms...could result in higher research and development costs.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from IBM 2022 10-K - 'The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products...similar to the company's' and 'if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained...we may be unable to develop new technologies.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AVGO and IBM rely heavily on IP protection and third-party software to maintain product demand. Weakening of IP rights and limitations in software licensing could reduce innovation, increase costs, and lead to competitive erosion, thereby negatively impacting product demand across the IT sector."

In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.\n\nWe also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend to our own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IP licensing business. An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFrom time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nIf our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nWe may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.\n\nFurther, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if software providers and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products.

      "answer": "IBM emphasizes its R&D investments in hybrid cloud and AI as central to its innovation strategy and long-term market differentiation, aiming to attract a developer ecosystem and maintain leadership in emerging technologies. In contrast, Intel faces competitive pressures in its data center business due to increasing customization demands from cloud service providers and the trend of cloud customers developing their own semiconductors. These dynamics suggest that while IBM is leveraging R&D to drive differentiation in AI and hybrid cloud, Intel is encountering execution risks and market shifts that have already adversely affected its Data Center Group (DCG) results in 2021. Therefore, IBM's R&D strategy supports its positioning in next-generation technologies, while Intel's R&D efforts are more reactive and strained by external market forces.",

The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021.\n\nSome cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.\n\n## Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\n\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\n- changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n- the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n- changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n- adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n- increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n- changes in available tax credits;\n- changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n- changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n- changes in accounting standards; and\n- our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\n\n## We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\n\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.",

Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022.

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

          "chunk_text": "- need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n- enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.\n\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that necessary licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that our existing licenses to third-party IP will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under opensource licensing terms.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues on a global basis. As described in \"Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.\n\n## We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees.\n\nHiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees, and the increased availability of work-from-home arrangements, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. We have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent. These efforts have increased our expenses, and they may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy. Changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.\n\nChanges in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we appointed a new CEO effective in February 2021 and a new CFO in January 2022 and made several other changes to our senior leadership during the past year. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions.\n\nOur acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. Strategic transactions are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy. We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n\n- our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;\n- failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;\n- disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;\n- failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, if at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals at all or without materially burdensome conditions, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or other unforeseen factors;\n- our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;\n- our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n- our inability to retain key personnel of acquired businesses or our difficulty in integrating employees, business systems, and technology;",

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results.

          "chunk_text": "Changes in the mix of products sold can materially impact our financial results. Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors. Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent a greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.\n\n## We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies. Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood.\n\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries such as TSMC to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by foundries, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products.\n\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the technology introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&amp;D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.\n\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.\n\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment, adverse changes in equipment productivity, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions-all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.\n\nWe face supply chain risks. We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools, equipment, and IP for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From time to time we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including the following:\n\n- suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;\n- supplier quality issues;\n- cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, manmade or natural disasters, operational failures, or other events that disrupt suppliers;\n- long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and\n\nOther Key Information\n\n53",

Intel (INTC), which relies on stable demand forecasting to manage its IDM 2.0 manufacturing strategy and associated costs (e.g., investments in abatement equipment and production processes), may face increased difficulty in aligning production capacity and cost structures. If IBM\u2019s strategic investments in growth areas like AI or hybrid cloud result in unpredictable demand for Intel-based hardware, Intel could experience underutilized capacity or rushed scaling efforts, both of which would increase per-unit manufacturing costs and operational complexity. This interplay demonstrates how IBM\u2019s market uncertainty could propagate through the supply chain and negatively impact Intel\u2019s cost management and production efficiency.",

          "chunk_text": "Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter our production processes. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented, numerous measures to try to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, and could in the future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our suppliers. We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries is taking measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. As a US federal government contractor, we are subject to a federal executive order requiring our US employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The order has been challenged in court and its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring. Similarly, this requirement would apply to our suppliers working at our US sites, and to the extent such suppliers refuse to comply or decline to work with us based on the requirement or other future vaccine mandates, our business may be adversely affected, including higher costs or delays for our construction projects. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.\n\nThe pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled \"Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results,\" and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Given the continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home dynamics may not continue as the pandemic progresses.\n\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; other actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to effectively. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n56",

      "question": "How does the impact of changes in product demand on Intel's (INTC) revenue compare to IBM's exposure to demand fluctuations in its growth areas, and what specific financial risk does each company highlight in their 2022 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Both IBM and Intel (INTC) highlight that changes in product demand can significantly affect their financial results. Intel specifically notes that demand for its products, especially in key segments like CCG and DCG platforms, can reduce revenue, lower gross margin, or lead to asset write-downs. IBM states that client adoption rates in high-growth, competitive segments are uncertain and that changes in customer preferences could lead to declining demand for its products or services. Intel quantifies the risk by noting that demand volatility, such as from supply chain disruptions or macroeconomic conditions, could directly impact its revenue and margins, while IBM emphasizes unpredictability in financial results due to market dynamics and customer behavior in evolving markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - IBM states that changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, and disruptive technologies could lead to declining demand for its products or services, making financial results difficult to predict.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Intel notes that changes in product demand, particularly for CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce revenue, lower gross margin, or require asset write-downs, and highlights specific factors like supply chain shortages and macroeconomic conditions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies identify product demand as a key financial risk, but Intel provides more specific segments and potential outcomes, while IBM focuses on broader market and competitive uncertainties."

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 25, 2021, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was $2.2 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 26, 2020). The substantial majority of our marketable equity securities portfolio as of December 25, 2021 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion, based on the value as of December 25, 2021 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 using an assumed decline of 60%).\n\nWe utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.\n\nMany of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of $4.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 ($3.3 billion as of December 26, 2020) and includes our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of $1.1 billion ($658 million as of December 26, 2020).\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nWhen any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&amp;A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.\n\n## Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.\n\nDemand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize or we may fail to capitalize on them. Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG and DCG platform products, can reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.\n\nImportant factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:\n\n- business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;\n- consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;\n- geopolitical conditions, including trade policies;\n- our ability to timely introduce competitive products;\n- competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;\n- the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;\n- customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the ongoing industry substrate and component shortages that negatively impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;\n- market acceptance and industry support of our products, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our products; and\n- customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as work- and learn-from-home trends.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n50",

      "answer": "Both AMD and IBM place the section 'Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities' in Part II of their 10-K filings, directly after the Part I risk factors and legal disclosures. This consistent placement across both companies suggests a strategic regulatory and investor relations emphasis on equity market transparency.

This consistent placement reflects standard governance transparency practices in SEC filings, ensuring investors can locate ownership details in a predictable section across different technology sector companies.",

      "answer": "AMD's 2022 10-K filing includes detailed sections on corporate governance and stockholder matters, such as 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters' (Item 12), which provides transparency into ownership structures and related disclosures. Similarly, IBM's 2022 10-K filing incorporates by reference its Proxy Statement, which includes detailed compensation tables like the '2021 Summary Compensation Table' and governance-related disclosures such as 'Election of Directors for a Term of One Year' and 'Governance and the Board-Corporate Governance.' These disclosures reflect both companies' commitment to transparency in corporate governance, with AMD providing direct access to governance policies within the 10-K and IBM leveraging its Proxy Statement to elaborate on executive compensation and board composition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMD's 2022 10-K - AMD includes 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters' under Item 12, indicating a structured approach to governance and transparency.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies disclose governance and stockholder matters, but IBM emphasizes detailed executive compensation through Proxy Statement incorporation, while AMD provides governance structure details directly in the 10-K."

      "answer": "AMD's two largest customers accounted for 14% and 11% of its 2021 revenue, totaling 25%. This significant customer concentration could impact IBM's hybrid cloud platform performance because IBM relies on consistent supply and innovation of high-performance computing components from major suppliers like AMD. If either of these key customers (who include large public cloud service providers) were lost, it could disrupt the supply of critical CPU/GPU technology used in IBM's hybrid cloud infrastructure solutions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Customers\n\nOur  microprocessor  customers  consist  primarily  of  original  equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs),  large  public  cloud service  providers,  original  design  manufacturers  (ODMs),  system  integrators  and  independent  distributors  in  both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online and brick and mortar retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs).\n\nCustomers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers' needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers' time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products.\n\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\n\nTwo customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Original Equipment Manufacturers\n\nWe  focus  on  three  types  of  OEM  partners:  multi-nationals,  selected  regional  accounts  and  some  local  system integrators,  who  target  commercial  and  consumer  end  customers  of  all  sizes.  Large  multi-nationals  and  regional accounts  are  the  core  of  our  OEM  partners'  business;  however,  we  are  increasingly  focused  on  the  Value  Added Reseller  (VAR)  channel  which  resells  OEM  systems  to  the  mid-market  and  the  small  and  medium  business  (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with  their  software  and  services  solutions  into  Enterprise,  HPC  and  Cloud  Service  Provider  Customers.  Our  OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors  handle  a  wide  variety  of  products,  and  may  include  those  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our  agreements  with  distributors  protect  their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements  with  our  distributors  may  contain  standard  stock  rotation  provisions  permitting  limited  levels  of  product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities.

      "answer": "Both AMD and IBM identify 'performance' as a key competitive factor, but they apply it differently based on their market focus. AMD competes in the semiconductor industry, where performance relates to product features like processor clock speed, energy efficiency, and integrated graphics capabilities. Their ability to deliver high-performance products on time is critical to maintaining competitiveness against rivals like Intel and ARM-based solutions. IBM, on the other hand, emphasizes performance in the context of its hybrid cloud and AI platforms, where performance is tied to delivering scalable, secure, and integrated solutions that optimize business workflows. For both companies, performance drives innovation and differentiation, but AMD focuses on hardware and processing capabilities while IBM focuses on integrated software and service performance.",

The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.\n\nWe  expect  that  competition  will  continue  to  be  intense  due  to  rapid  technological  changes,  frequent  product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing  by  competitors,  especially  during  challenging  economic  times.  In  addition,  our  competitors  have  significant marketing  and  sales  resources  which  could  increase  the  competitive  environment  in  a  declining  market,  leading  to lower  prices  and  margins.  Some  competitors  may  have  greater  access  or  rights  to  complementary  technologies, including  interface,  processor  and  memory  technical  information.  For  instance,  with  our  APU  products  and  other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is seeking to expand its position in integrated graphics for  the  PC  market  with  high-end  discrete  graphics  solutions  for  a  broad  range  of  computing  segments,  which  may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like  the ARM architecture.  Increased  adoption  of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  entering  markets  with  current  and  new  competitors  who  may  be  able  to  adapt  more  quickly  to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against  current  or  new  competitors  who  may  have  stronger  positions  in  these  new  markets  or  superior  ability  to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry.",

Business:\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today-we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients' digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.\n\nThe following information is included in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference:\n\nIBM Strategy-pages 11 to 13.\n\nBusiness Segments and Capabilities-pages 13 to 15.\n\nHuman Capital-pages 15 to 16.\n\n## Competition\n\nIBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities.

      "answer": "IBM's 10-K filing highlights that uncertainty in client adoption rates for emerging technologies could unfavorably impact demand for its products and services. Since AMD operates in the same Information Technology sector and supplies components like CPUs, GPUs, and semi-custom SoC products that could be integrated into IBM's technology offerings or used by IBM's clients, a decline in IBM's client adoption could reduce the downstream demand for AMD's products. This creates a multi-hop causal chain where IBM's market challenges could indirectly reduce product demand for AMD.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - IBM notes that 'client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments' and this uncertainty 'may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMD states that 'demand for AMD's products' is a key forward-looking factor and that its business includes supplying 'discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs, and semi-custom system-on-chip (SoC) products.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since AMD's products are used in data centers, professional computing, and semi-custom applications, and IBM operates in similar IT infrastructure and enterprise markets, a decline in IBM's client adoption could reduce the need for components like AMD's GPUs or SoCs, thereby negatively impacting AMD's product demand."

If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted.\n\nRisks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM's costs may increase.\n\nIBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.\n\nCertain of the company's offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\n\nRisks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control.\n\nThe Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated",

      "answer": "Cisco's service revenue of $13,539 million represents a significant portion of its total revenue of $51,557 million, indicating a substantial reliance on services to complement its product offerings. IBM, while operating in the same sector, did not disclose a separate service revenue figure in the provided excerpt, suggesting either a different reporting structure or a more integrated approach to services within its broader revenue streams. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to directly compare service contributions between the two companies, potentially reflecting different strategic priorities or financial reporting philosophies.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Cisco reported service revenue of $13,539 million in 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - IBM did not disclose a separate service revenue figure in the provided excerpt.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The availability of Cisco's service revenue and the absence of IBM's service revenue detail prevents a direct comparison of their service-based financial contributions, implying differing levels of transparency or business focus."

      "answer": "Fluctuations in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities could adversely affect IBM's future financial position by altering its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Cisco's experience shows that unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion could reduce by $1 billion in the next 12 months, which would affect the effective tax rate if realized. This indicates that changes in tax valuation can have a material impact on financial outcomes. For IBM, which operates in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to continuous tax examinations, similar changes in valuation or resolution of tax matters could lead to increased tax expenses or volatility in financial results, especially if lower-than-expected income occurs in countries with lower tax rates or higher-than-expected income in high-tax jurisdictions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - The potential resolution of tax uncertainties, as seen in Cisco's case, could directly influence IBM's financial outcomes by increasing tax expenses or creating volatility, particularly under ongoing international tax scrutiny and potential OECD guideline changes."

Our net penalty expense  for  fiscal  2022,  2021,  and  2020  was  not  material.  Our  total  accrual  for  interest  and  penalties  was  $486  million,  $444 million,  and  $340  million  as  of  the  end  of  fiscal  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  respectively.

We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2008, respectively.\n\nWe regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions.

As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of  cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the European Court of Justice decision in the Schrems II matter; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws and Regulations\n\nThe Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position.\n\nTax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\n\nThe Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note S, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.",

      "answer": "The combined increase in the Ending Balance of Deferred Tax Liabilities from fiscal year 2021 to 2022 for AVGO and CSCO is $1,011 million. AVGO's Deferred Tax Liabilities increased by $87 million (1.73%), while CSCO's Deferred Tax Liabilities remained flat at $3,101 million, representing a 0% change. Therefore, AVGO's increase was solely responsible for the total growth in the combined balance.",

        "Step 1: From AVGO's 10-K filing, extract the Ending Balance of Deferred Tax Liabilities for 2022 ($5,117 million) and 2021 ($5,030 million) to calculate the increase of $87 million.",
        "Step 2: From CSCO's 10-K filing, extract the Ending Balance of Deferred Tax Liabilities for 2022 ($3,101 million) and 2021 ($3,106 million) to calculate the decrease of $5 million, which effectively results in no net change.",
        "Step 3: Combine the changes in both companies' Deferred Tax Liabilities: $87 million (AVGO) + $0 (CSCO) = $87 million net increase.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the percentage growth for AVGO: ($87 / $5,030) * 100 = 1.73%.",
        "Step 5: Since CSCO's balance did not increase, its percentage growth is 0%.",
        "Step 6: Summarize the comparison: AVGO\u2019s Deferred Tax Liability growth was the only contributor to the combined increase."

      "answer": "AVGO adopted ASU 2021-08, which requires contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured under ASC 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. This changes how entities like CSCO, which reported a $1,100 million increase in total revenue from contracts with customers, must account for such liabilities in acquisitions. If CSCO engages in a business combination involving contract liabilities, it would need to apply ASC 606 at fair value on the acquisition date, potentially affecting the allocation of purchase price and future revenue recognition patterns.",

This guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.\n\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs, in-the-money stock options, and ESPP rights (together referred to as 'equity awards'), as well as convertible preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.\n\nThe dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance. In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if it had originated the contracts. We early adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and it did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.

      "question": "How might a prolonged disruption at AVGO's Fort Collins facility impact Cisco's (CSCO) ability to meet customer orders, and by what mechanism?",
      "answer": "A prolonged disruption at AVGO's Fort Collins facility, which is the sole source for FBAR components used in many of its wireless devices, could limit AVGO's capacity to meet customer demands. This, in turn, could affect Cisco (CSCO), if it relies on AVGO as a supplier for these components. As a result, Cisco may face delays in manufacturing or fulfilling its own customer orders, especially if it cannot quickly source these components elsewhere. CSCO has indicated that the timing, size, and mix of customer orders significantly affect its operating results, and a disruption in supply from AVGO could lead to inventory shortages, increased costs, or delays in product shipments. These issues could cause Cisco to experience nonlinearity in shipping patterns, reduced gross margins, and potential customer dissatisfaction, all of which could materially affect its financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source AVGO_10k_2022.pdf - The Fort Collins facility is the sole source for FBAR components used in AVGO's wireless devices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source CSCO_10k_2022.pdf - Cisco's operating results are significantly affected by the timing, size, and mix of customer orders and are sensitive to supply chain disruptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If AVGO cannot supply FBAR components due to a facility disruption, Cisco may face delays or cost increases in obtaining these components, directly impacting its ability to fulfill customer orders on time and affecting its financial performance."

We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.\n\n## An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloudbased and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers', suppliers' and employees' confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.",

Any  of  the  foregoing  factors,  or  any  other  factors  discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.\n\n## Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\n\nChallenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess  and  obsolete  inventories;  risk  of  supply  constraints;  risk  of  excess  facilities  and  manufacturing  capacity;  and  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\n\nThe global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In certain prior periods, we have seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the  world  (including  as  a  result  of  the  on-going  Russia  and  Ukraine  war,  and  China-Taiwan  relations),  the  current  economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain  uncertain  or  deteriorate  further,  we  may  experience  material  impacts  on  our  business,  operating  results,  and  financial condition.\n\nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers' perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products  in  the  United  States.  Trust  and  confidence  in  us  as  an  IT  supplier  are  critical  to  the  development  and  growth  of  our markets.  Impairment  of  that  trust,  or  foreign  regulatory  actions  taken  in  response  to  reports  of  certain  intelligence  gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\n\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment (including as a result of the Russia and Ukraine war), the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, as it did in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on a year-over-year basis, or decline as it did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and certain prior periods. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have  exceeded  net  bookings  or  manufacturing  issues  have  delayed  shipments,  leading  to  nonlinearity  in  shipping  patterns.  In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can",

      "answer": "A prolonged disruption at AVGO's Fort Collins facility, which is a sole source for FBAR components used in many of AVGO's wireless devices, could lead to delays in AVGO's product development and shipments. Since Cisco (CSCO) experienced a 6% increase in product revenue in fiscal 2022, any disruption in AVGO's ability to supply critical components could affect Cisco's ability to meet its product revenue growth targets. If Cisco relies on AVGO's wireless components for its products, a disruption could delay Cisco's product manufacturing and shipments, potentially reducing its product revenue growth below the 6% reported in fiscal 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AVGO's Fort Collins facility is the sole source for FBAR components used in many of its wireless devices.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Cisco's product revenue increased by 6% in fiscal 2022.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If AVGO's Fort Collins facility experiences a prolonged disruption, it could delay AVGO's product shipments, which may impact Cisco's ability to maintain its 6% product revenue growth if it relies on AVGO's components."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations, or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and suppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the U.S., with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses, especially our Colorado, Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, or for any other reason, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. To date, we have not experienced a material event, however such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.\n\n## An impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur business depends on various internally managed IT systems and outsourced IT services, including cloudbased and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development, network monitoring and electronic communication services, as well as third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers', suppliers' and employees' confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. In addition, software products we use (including technologies produced by us) have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmanaged, could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, AVGO did not claim the FDII deduction (impact = 0.0%), while CSCO reported a negative impact of 3.9% on its effective tax rate due to the FDII deduction. Therefore, the combined impact of the FDII deduction on the effective tax rates of AVGO and CSCO in 2022 was -3.9%. In 2021, AVGO reported an FDII deduction impact of -3.1%, and CSCO reported an impact of -4.2%. Thus, the combined impact in 2021 was -7.3%. This shows a smaller tax benefit from the FDII deduction in 2022 compared to 2021.",

      "answer": "AVGO's product cost as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 24% in fiscal 2021 to 23% in fiscal 2022, indicating improved cost efficiency. This marginal improvement could provide AVGO with more financial flexibility to manage external supply chain risks, such as those described by CSCO, which include component shortages, extended lead times, and increased supply chain costs due to the pandemic. A lower cost of products sold gives AVGO more room to absorb unexpected cost increases or disruptions in the supply chain without significantly affecting profitability.",

Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our financial results and business operations. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Shelter-in-place  and/or  lockdown  orders globally and other measures have and could in the future impact our supply chain. In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can  also  impact  our  ability  to  meet  customer  demand  and  could  materially  adversely  affect  us.  Our  customers  have  also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend  on  many  factors  outside  our  control,  including,  without  limitation,  the  timing,  extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the pandemic, the efficacy of available vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this 'Risk Factors' section.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\n\nOur operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include:\n\n- Fluctuations  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services,  especially  with  respect  to  service  providers  and  Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment\n- Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue\n- Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments\n- Price  and  product  competition  in  the  communications  and  networking  industries,  which  can  change  rapidly  due  to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions\n- The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers\n- The  introduction  and  market  acceptance  of  new  technologies  and  products,  and  our  success  in  new  and  evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards\n- The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time\n- Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales",

      "answer": "The difference in hedge accounting fair value adjustments between Intel and Oracle in 2022 is $834 million. Intel reported $811 million in adjustments, while Oracle reported -$23 million. This significant contrast indicates differing approaches to managing interest rate risk: Intel appears to be actively hedging its exposure, resulting in a positive fair value adjustment, whereas Oracle's negative adjustment suggests a different hedging strategy or less exposure requiring adjustment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel's hedge accounting fair value adjustments in 2022 were $811 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Oracle's hedge accounting fair value adjustments in 2022 were -$23 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $811 million - (-$23 million) = $834 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The large difference in hedge accounting fair value adjustments indicates contrasting financial strategies in managing interest rate risk between the two companies."

Intel's litigation charges contributed to a total restructuring and other charges of $2,626 million in 2021, significantly affecting profitability. Oracle noted that its fiscal 2022 operating margin was negatively impacted by litigation-related charges, which were partially offset by higher segment margins and gains from asset sales. The difference in litigation charges between the two companies was $2,291 million (Intel) minus an unspecified Oracle amount, but Oracle explicitly called out litigation as a major drag on operating margin performance.",

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud@Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer's own data center), on-premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated  stack  of  applications  and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  Oracle  develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and  hardware  products  and  related  services  to  manage  their  own  cloud-based  or  on-premise  IT  environments.  Customers  that purchase  our  software  licenses  may  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts,  which  provide  our  customers  with  rights  to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  included  our  accounts  and  the  accounts  of  our  wholly-  and  majority-owned  subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as  a  component  of  non-operating  expenses  or  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges that are more fully described in Note 16 below. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $2.3 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes; and ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , neither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth  in  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon",

For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2022 and 2021, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.07 million in fiscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.22 million in fiscal  2021  (using  1.22  as  the  month-end  average  exchange  rate  for  the  period).

      "answer": "Intel reported employee severance expenses of $48 million in fiscal 2021, a significant decrease from $124 million in fiscal 2020, indicating a reduction in restructuring activities. Oracle, on the other hand, incurred severance expenses specifically in fiscal 2022 related to its restructuring plan, without a disclosed prior-year comparison, suggesting a more recent or intensified focus on workforce restructuring. This contrast shows that Intel was scaling down restructuring costs, while Oracle was actively incurring new restructuring-related severance during fiscal 2022.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Intel's employee severance expenses were $48 million in fiscal 2021 and $124 million in fiscal 2020, showing a downward trend.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two companies reveals Intel was reducing restructuring-related severance costs year-over-year, while Oracle was incurring new severance costs as part of a newly initiated restructuring plan in fiscal 2022."

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud@Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer's own data center), on-premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated  stack  of  applications  and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  Oracle  develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and  hardware  products  and  related  services  to  manage  their  own  cloud-based  or  on-premise  IT  environments.  Customers  that purchase  our  software  licenses  may  elect  to  purchase  license  support  contracts,  which  provide  our  customers  with  rights  to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\n\n## Basis of Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated  financial  statements  included  our  accounts  and  the  accounts  of  our  wholly-  and  majority-owned  subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle's stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as  a  component  of  non-operating  expenses  or  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges that are more fully described in Note 16 below. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021 was impacted by a $2.3 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes; and ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , neither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth  in  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon",

      "answer": "The combined potential financial impact would depend on the duration and severity of workforce disruptions at Intel's manufacturing sites and Oracle's cloud services division. Intel specifically cites risks to its IDM 2.0 strategy, where vaccine mandates could lead to higher costs or delays in construction projects, directly affecting its ability to expand manufacturing capacity. Oracle notes that pandemic-related preventative measures, including vaccine mandates, have already led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries where its customers operate. Without specific mitigation strategies or recovery timelines from either company, the financial impact could include increased operational costs for Intel and reduced cloud revenue for Oracle, though exact figures are not quantified in the filings.",

          "chunk_text": "Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, such as air quality and wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment, purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter our production processes. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations are subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Authorities have imposed, and businesses and individuals have implemented, numerous measures to try to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, shutdowns, and vaccine requirements. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers and partners. We have experienced, and could in the future experience, reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our suppliers. We have significant manufacturing operations in the US, Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries is taking measures in response to the pandemic. Restrictions on our manufacturing or support operations or workforce, similar limitations for our suppliers, and transportation restrictions or disruptions can limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or cancelled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including with respect to employee travel; employee work locations; cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences; and social distancing measures. As a US federal government contractor, we are subject to a federal executive order requiring our US employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The order has been challenged in court and its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring. Similarly, this requirement would apply to our suppliers working at our US sites, and to the extent such suppliers refuse to comply or decline to work with us based on the requirement or other future vaccine mandates, our business may be adversely affected, including higher costs or delays for our construction projects. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or others, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.\n\nThe pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has led to volatility in capital markets and credit markets. Risks related to adverse changes in global economic conditions are described in our risk factor titled \"Global or regional conditions can harm our financial results,\" and include the risk that demand for our products will be significantly harmed. Given the continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. For example, the increased demand for notebook products as a result of work- and learn-from-home dynamics may not continue as the pandemic progresses.\n\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; other actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to effectively. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially adversely affect us. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section and throughout this report.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n56",

The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have affected how we and our customers, partners and suppliers are operating our businesses. Our operations have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-fromhome directives and shelter-in-place/social distancing orders. These preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate. It is not clear what long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the effects on our customers, partners, suppliers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.\n\nWe  are  a  U.S.  federal  government  contractor  and  are  therefore  subject  to  a  federal  executive  order  requiring  our  U.S.-based employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The executive order has been challenged in court and has been enjoined from enforcement, but its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement  or  other  future  vaccine  mandates  could  adversely  affect  our  workforce  retention  and  hiring.  In  addition,  customer vaccination requirements, as well as certain state and local vaccination mandates, may impact our staffing abilities.\n\nThe negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers' business operations and their demand for our products will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, partners, suppliers and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially and adversely affect us. In addition, we have curtailed travel expenses since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,  and  it  may  become  necessary  for  us  to  increase  such  travel  expenses  prospectively  in  furtherance  of  our  business initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\n\n## Data Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks\n\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers' data or our IT systems  are  accessed  improperly,  made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers  may  stop  using  our  products  and  services,  any  of  which  could  reduce  our  revenue  and  earnings,  increase  our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Our  products  and  services,  including  Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers' information and data, as well as our own data. We believe that Oracle in particular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts  of  data,  including  in  customer  sectors  involving  particularly  sensitive  data  such  as  health  sciences,  financial  services, retail, hospitality and the government. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals  sponsored  by  them)  to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our  security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers', partners' and suppliers' software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential",

      "answer": "Intel faces risks related to data privacy due to its increasing involvement in the MaaS market through its Mobileye business, which involves collecting more personal data. This exposes Intel to higher compliance costs and potential legal penalties under global privacy regulations. Additionally, Intel is exposed to IP litigation risks, as seen in the VLSI case where a jury awarded $2.2 billion in damages. Oracle, on the other hand, faces data privacy and cybersecurity risks due to the large volume of sensitive customer data it manages, particularly in sectors like health sciences and financial services. If both companies were to face simultaneous legal challenges\u2014one related to a major data breach (impacting Oracle\u2019s customer operations) and another related to IP litigation (impacting Intel\u2019s Mobileye business)\u2014the combined financial exposure could exceed $2.2 billion just from known liabilities, not including potential fines, reputational damage, or lost revenue from disrupted operations.",

A simultaneous legal challenge involving a data breach at Oracle and an IP litigation case at Intel (like VLSI) could result in combined financial liabilities exceeding $2.2 billion, with additional indirect costs such as reputational harm and operational disruption."

          "chunk_text": "Theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. We anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase as we enter into the MaaS market in our Mobileye business, and it may increase as we enter into other new or adjacent businesses. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacyrelated or data-protection laws and regulations could result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.\n\n## We are subject to IP risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law-as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others-to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. Enforcement is costly and time-consuming and can divert management attention. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations-and governments or courts render decisions-requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&amp;D, product development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees .\n\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\n\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties, including claims from those who have aggregated patents acquired from multiple sources to form a new, larger portfolio to assert claims against us and other companies. Additionally, large patent portfolio owners sometimes divest portions of their portfolios to more than one individual or company, increasing the number of parties who own IP rights previously all held by a single party. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by investment firms and other third parties. In some instances, these entities have filed multi-jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damages and/or injunctions against us. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. For example, in the multi-jurisdiction litigation brought against us by VLSI, a jury in one of the pending US federal court cases returned a verdict in February 2021 awarding approximately $2.2 billion in damages to VLSI, as discussed in Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters, including the availability of injunctive relief for non-practicing entities, and the US Patent and Trademark Office's reduction of inter partes patent review under the America Invents Act. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment.\n\nWe are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n\n- pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;\n- stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n\nOther Key Information",

The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have affected how we and our customers, partners and suppliers are operating our businesses. Our operations have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-fromhome directives and shelter-in-place/social distancing orders. These preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate. It is not clear what long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the effects on our customers, partners, suppliers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.\n\nWe  are  a  U.S.  federal  government  contractor  and  are  therefore  subject  to  a  federal  executive  order  requiring  our  U.S.-based employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions. The executive order has been challenged in court and has been enjoined from enforcement, but its ultimate status, and the impact on our business, is uncertain. However, this requirement  or  other  future  vaccine  mandates  could  adversely  affect  our  workforce  retention  and  hiring.  In  addition,  customer vaccination requirements, as well as certain state and local vaccination mandates, may impact our staffing abilities.\n\nThe negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers' business operations and their demand for our products will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise. We are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, partners, suppliers and other partners, but a material effect on these parties could also materially and adversely affect us. In addition, we have curtailed travel expenses since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,  and  it  may  become  necessary  for  us  to  increase  such  travel  expenses  prospectively  in  furtherance  of  our  business initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\n\n## Data Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks\n\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers' data or our IT systems  are  accessed  improperly,  made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers  may  stop  using  our  products  and  services,  any  of  which  could  reduce  our  revenue  and  earnings,  increase  our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Our  products  and  services,  including  Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers' information and data, as well as our own data. We believe that Oracle in particular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts  of  data,  including  in  customer  sectors  involving  particularly  sensitive  data  such  as  health  sciences,  financial  services, retail, hospitality and the government. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals  sponsored  by  them)  to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our  security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers', partners' and suppliers' software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential",

      "answer": "Oracle's income tax effects adjustment in 2022 was $1,723 million compared to Intel's unspecified but implied lower amount. Since Intel could not provide a reconciliation for its long-term gross margin outlook exclusions, including income tax effects, the exact difference cannot be calculated.

Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market conditions;\n- Long-lived assets-the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment of property, plant and equipment, identified intangibles, and goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units;\n- Non-marketable equity investments-the valuation estimates and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustments; and\n- Loss contingencies-the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our annual cash bonus plan.\n\nLong-term gross margin outlook range is provided on a non-GAAP basis and excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and share-based compensation expense. We are unable to provide a full reconciliation of this measure to the corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, as the amount and timing of such adjustments on a long-term basis are subject to considerable uncertainty. We believe such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n\n",

This forward-looking earnings impact contrasts with Intel's near-term earnings boost of approximately $8 million (before taxes) from reclassifying net derivative gains into earnings over the next 12 months.

Historically, we have invested billions  of  dollars  to  acquire  a  number  of  complementary  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies.  As  compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Cerner Corporation (Cerner), a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems that are designed to enable medical professionals to deliver better healthcare to individual patients and communities, for a preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $28.2 billion. The transaction closed on June 8, 2022. Notes 2 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions.\n\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances,  cash  generated  from  operations,  additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  of  additional  securities.  We  estimate  the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  can  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting  policies  that  reflect  our  more  significant  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  and  which  we  believe  are  the  most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:\n\n- Revenue Recognition;\n- Business Combinations;\n- Goodwill and Intangible Assets-Impairment Assessments;\n- Accounting for Income Taxes; and\n- Legal and Other Contingencies.\n\nOur  senior  management  has  reviewed  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  related  disclosures  with  the  Finance  and  Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Customers ,  and  our  revenue  recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation.",

TXN, on the other hand, explicitly states that it will invest to strengthen its competitive advantages, particularly in its Analog and Embedded Processing segments, which generated $14.05 billion and $3.05 billion in 2021, respectively. The difference in focus means NVDA may be more forward-looking and speculative in its investment, while TXN is more disciplined and aligned with its existing product portfolio and customer relationships. This distinction influences their competitive positioning, with NVDA driving disruptive innovation and TXN reinforcing its established market presence.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&amp;D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "question": "How do the differences in warranty cost experiences between NVDA and TXN in fiscal year 2022 reflect contrasting impacts on their financial results and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA (NVDA) faced significant risks and potential financial exposure due to product defects, with the potential for high warranty, repair, and replacement costs, as well as reputational damage and loss of market share. In contrast, Texas Instruments (TXN) reported no material accruals or payments related to product warranties or liabilities during the same period, indicating minimal financial impact from warranty claims. This contrast highlights that while NVDA's complex product design and global supply chain exposed it to higher warranty-related financial risk in 2022, TXN's operations and product reliability resulted in negligible warranty costs, leading to a more favorable financial position in this regard.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NVDA's 10-K - NVDA identified substantial risks of warranty costs due to product defects, which could lead to significant expenses, reputational harm, and loss of revenue.",
        "Step 2: Extract from TXN's 10-K - TXN disclosed that it had no material warranty accruals or payments in fiscal year 2022 and historically experienced low product claim rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Comparing the two reveals that NVDA faced a higher risk and potential financial burden from warranty-related issues, while TXN experienced minimal impact, suggesting differing levels of product reliability or supply chain risk management."

Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\n\nWe  also  face  risks  related  to  business  trends  that  may  be  influenced  by  climate  change  concerns.  We  may  face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient  design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be  able  to  successfully  integrate  acquisition  targets,  which  could  hurt  our  ability  to  grow  our  business, develop new products or sell our products.\n\nWe have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives.\n\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that  our  resources  are  limited,  if  we  pursue  a  particular  transaction,  we  may  limit  our  ability  to  enter  into  other transactions  that  could  help  us  achieve  our  strategic  objectives.  If  we  are  unable  to  timely  complete  acquisitions, including  due  to  delays  and  challenges  in  obtaining  regulatory  approvals,  we  may  be  unable  to  pursue  other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition  less  attractive,  and  other  changes  can  take  place  which  could  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement  whereby  NVIDIA  would  have  acquired Arm  from  SoftBank.  The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\n\nRisks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\n\n- difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business;\n- diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;\n- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\n- difficulty  or  inability  in  obtaining  governmental,  regulatory  approval  or  restrictions  or  other  consents  and approvals or financing;\n- Stock  price  impact,  fines,  fees  or  reputation  harm  if  we  are  unable  to  obtain  regulatory  approval  for  an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n- legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\n- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;",

      "answer": "The $5.00 billion debt issuance by NVDA in June 2021 led to a $52 million increase in interest expense (from $184 million in FY2021 to $236 million in FY2022), directly affecting their financial outflows. This increase suggests that NVDA\u2019s financial strategy incorporated higher leverage, likely to fund growth initiatives or strategic investments. However, TXN\u2019s 10-K highlights that issuing similar debt could pose risks, particularly if market conditions shift\u2014such as rising interest rates or financial instability\u2014which could impair their ability to service the debt, reduce funds available for operations or shareholder returns, and expose them to liquidity constraints.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NVDA issued a $5.00 billion note in June 2021, which caused interest expense to rise from $184 million in FY2021 to $236 million in FY2022 (an increase of $52 million).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - TXN notes that debt obligations could divert funds from operations or shareholder returns, and that their ability to service debt depends on performance, which is subject to economic conditions, industry cycles, and other external factors.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - NVDA\u2019s increased interest expense shows the direct financial impact of large-scale debt issuance. TXN\u2019s risk disclosures suggest that if they were to issue similar debt, especially in uncertain market conditions, they could face similar or amplified risks, including liquidity constraints and reduced operational flexibility."

          "chunk_text": "\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven  by  stock-based  compensation,  compensation-related  costs  associated  with  employee  growth  and  higher infrastructure costs.\n\n## Sales, General and Administrative\n\nSales,  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  12%  in  fiscal  year  2022  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\n\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense  was  $236  million  and  $184  million  in  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  The  increase  in  expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\n\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in nonaffiliated  entities.  Refer  to  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe increase in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  year  2022  as  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  was  primarily  due  to  an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.",

      "answer": "NVDA's international supply chain exposes it to risks such as low manufacturing yields, supplier loss, and product defects, which can negatively impact its gross margin. With 84% of its revenue coming from international sales, disruptions in global operations\u2014like supplier prioritization or production delays\u2014could significantly reduce profitability. In contrast, TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, allowing it to spread fixed costs over higher output as factory loadings increase. This was evident in 2021 when TXN achieved a gross margin of 67.5%, partly due to the efficiency of its 300mm production. Therefore, while NVDA's reliance on external foundries and international markets increases vulnerability to cost overruns and quality issues, TXN's internalized manufacturing strategy enhances gross margin stability and scalability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from NVDA evidence - 84% of revenue comes from international sales, indicating high exposure to global supply chain risks.",

When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\n- For an explanation of free cash flow and the term 'annual operating tax rate,' see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\n- All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.\n\n## Results of operations\n\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300millimeter production.\n\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\n\n## Details of financial results - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nRevenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.\n\nGross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.\n\nOperating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.\n\nAcquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.\n\nRestructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.\n\nOther income and expense (OI&amp;E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.",

      "question": "How does NVDA's inventory risk and supply chain strategy potentially contrast with TXN's manufacturing cost structure in impacting their respective gross margins in 2022?",
      "answer": "NVDA's gross margin is negatively impacted by inventory risks and supply chain constraints, such as placing non-cancellable orders with long lead times and paying premiums to secure supply, which could lead to excess inventory charges if demand decreases. In contrast, TXN benefits from owning much of its manufacturing capacity, where increased factory loadings spread fixed costs over more output, thereby increasing gross margin. NVDA's strategy involves higher risk and potential cost volatility, while TXN's model provides more cost control and margin stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NVDA evidence - NVDA places non-cancellable inventory orders up to 12 months in advance and may pay premiums to secure supply, which could lead to excess inventory charges and negatively impact gross margins.",
        "Step 2: Extract from TXN evidence - TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, and when factory loadings increase, fixed costs are spread over more output, increasing profit margins.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - NVDA's supply chain strategy introduces cost volatility and inventory risk that can reduce gross margins, whereas TXN\u2019s ownership of manufacturing capacity provides structural cost advantages that increase gross margins as output rises."

We  may  also  face  supply  constraints  caused  by  natural  disasters  or  other  events.  If  we  are  able  to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\n\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we  are  in  today,  we  have  placed  and  may  continue  to  place  non-cancellable  inventory  orders  in  advance  of  our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months' lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters  and  long-term  supply  and  capacity  needs.  However,  we  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict  when  such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if  there  is  a  partial  or  complete  reduction  in  long-term  demand  for  our  products  or  if  such  demand  is  served  by  our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\n\nWe  depend  on  third  parties  and  their  technology  to  manufacture,  assemble,  test,  package  or  design  our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.\n\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on  third-party  software  development  tools  to  assist  us  in  the  design,  simulation  and  verification  of  new  products  or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n- lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n- failure  by  our  foundries  or  contract  manufacturers  to  procure  raw  materials  or  to  provide  adequate  levels  of manufacturing or test capacity for our products;",
