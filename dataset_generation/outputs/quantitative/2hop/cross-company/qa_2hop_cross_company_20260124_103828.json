      "question": "How does the reliance on tenant leases impact both AMT and SPG's liquidity and revenue stability, especially considering AMT's $3.2 billion expected 2025 distributions and SPG's vulnerability to reduced consumer foot traffic?",
      "answer": "AMT's liquidity is closely tied to tenant leases, as a significant majority of its revenues are derived from multiyear contracts, which provide recurring revenue critical to funding its $3.2 billion expected 2025 distributions. Its ability to maintain and convert this revenue into operating profit depends on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies. In contrast, SPG's tenant lease performance is directly affected by consumer foot traffic, which has been negatively impacted by public safety concerns, e-commerce shifts, and health crises. These factors reduce tenant sales and occupancy, directly affecting SPG\u2019s leasing goals and revenue. If SPG fails to maintain tenant commitments or lease rates decline due to external pressures, its liquidity and ability to generate consistent revenue would be materially impacted. Thus, both companies depend on tenant leases for financial stability, but external risks to tenant performance threaten their respective revenue streams in different ways.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT relies on multiyear tenant leases for recurring revenue, which is essential for funding its $3.2 billion expected 2025 distributions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG's tenant leases are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic due to safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and health-related disruptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG depend on tenant leases for revenue and liquidity, but SPG faces greater exposure to consumer behavior shifts, which could impair its ability to meet leasing goals and maintain consistent cash flow, unlike AMT\u2019s more stable, contract-based income."

The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board.\n\nAsset Retirement ObligationsWe are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2024, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.5 billion.\n\n## Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\n\nOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor's understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.\n\nInternally Generated Funds -Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2024 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our ex isting communications infrastructure.\n\nRestrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities -Each Bank Loan Agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The Bank Loan Agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.\n\n",

      "answer": "AMT benefits from long-term tenant leases with wireless carriers, where approximately 52% of leases have a renewal date of 2030 or beyond, providing significant revenue stability. In contrast, SPG faces risks related to tenant performance and occupancy levels due to evolving consumer behavior, e-commerce competition, and potential underreporting of sales, which could reduce lease renewals and rental rates. This contrast highlights that AMT's lease structure supports predictable long-term revenue, while SPG's retail-focused leasing model is more vulnerable to market shifts and tenant defaults, potentially leading to greater revenue volatility.",

In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets.\n\n- A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located on a tract of land of up to 20 acres.\n- A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.\n- A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.\n- Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Africa &amp; APAC, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.\n\nU.S. &amp; Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2024, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2018 and March 2023 (the '2018 Securitization' and the '2023 Securitization', respectively, and together, the 'Trust Securitizations') is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,029 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the 'Trust Sites') and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the '2015 Securitization') are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,338 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the '2015 Secured Sites').\n\nThere are no encumbered sites in our Africa &amp; APAC, Europe or Latin America property segments or in our Data Centers segment.\n\nGround Leases. Of the 148,097 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2024, approximately 80% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter longterm ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 56% of the ground leases for our sites have a final ex piration date of 2034 and beyond.\n\nCustomers . Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (19%), AT&amp;T (18%) and Verizon Wireless (13%).\n\nAcross most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 52% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2030 or beyond.\n\nData Centers. We own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2024, our data center portfolio consisted of 29 data center facilities across ten United States markets, across 3.3 million net rentable square feet ('NRSF').\n\nOffices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 100,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. &amp; Canada, Africa &amp; APAC, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.",

      "answer": "SPG reported total Repairs and Maintenance Expenses of $93,595,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. AMT disclosed that its property operations expenses include Repairs and Maintenance as one component, along with ground rent, power and fuel costs, and property taxes. However, AMT did not provide a specific dollar amount for Repairs and Maintenance expenses, only describing it as part of a broader category of direct operating expenses. Therefore, while both companies report Repairs and Maintenance as part of property operations, only SPG provided a quantifiable figure for this expense category.",

        "Step 1: From SPG's 10-K filing, extract the specific dollar amount for Repairs and Maintenance Expenses, which is $93,595,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.",
        "Step 2: From AMT's 10-K filing, identify that Repairs and Maintenance is a component of their property operations expenses, which also include ground rent, power and fuel costs, and property taxes, but no specific dollar amount is given for Repairs and Maintenance.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two pieces of information to compare the transparency and scope of expense reporting between the two companies, noting that SPG quantifies the expense while AMT only describes it in general terms."

Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level ex penses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.",

      "answer": "AMT maintains greater revenue stability through its structured lease arrangements with fixed escalation clauses and financial penalties for early termination, which discourage tenants from ending leases prematurely. These leases typically have initial terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal options, and often include pass-through costs for power, which are recognized as revenue over time. In contrast, SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to its reliance on consumer foot traffic and exposure to unpredictable external factors like civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts. SPG\u2019s leasing goals are more vulnerable to market volatility, such as oversupply of retail space and reduced consumer willingness to shop in person, which could lead to lower occupancy and rental rates. As a result, AMT benefits from more predictable, long-term cash flows, while SPG must adapt its business model to evolving consumer behavior and external disruptions to maintain revenue stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT\u2019s leases have initial terms of 5\u201310 years with multiple renewal terms and include fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index adjustments, along with penalties for early termination.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT recognizes fixed power revenue monthly over the lease term and variable power revenue as uncertainty is resolved, indicating stable and predictable revenue streams.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG\u2019s leasing goals are vulnerable to risks such as oversupply of retail space, e-commerce competition, and reduced consumer foot traffic, which could negatively impact occupancy and rental rates.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s structured, long-term leases with penalties and cost pass-throughs provide greater revenue predictability, while SPG\u2019s dependence on consumer behavior and exposure to external risks (e.g., pandemics, crime) make its leasing outcomes more volatile.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The difference in lease structure and risk exposure leads to divergent revenue stability and tenant retention strategies: AMT focuses on long-term lease enforcement and cost recovery, while SPG must adapt to external market shifts and tenant performance risks."

The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee.\n\nLessor -The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company's communications real estate assets. The Company's lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fix ed escalation percentage or an inflationary index , or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the ex piration of the lease term.\n\nThe Company's leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer's underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fix ed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\n\nThe Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets.",

I f any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face m aterial dam age physically and reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively im pacted.

In contrast, SPG faces significant risks to leasing performance due to external factors such as consumer behavior shifts, e-commerce competition, and public safety concerns, which can directly impact tenant lease renewals and rental rates.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nfuture periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase or 'escalate' the rent due under the lease, typically based on (a) an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States), (b) an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or (c) a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.\n\nBased upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a strategic review of our India business, as further discussed below under 'Results of Operations-Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes.' The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction. The ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024. On September 12, 2024, we completed the ATC TIPL Transaction and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). ATC TIPL's operating results are presented as discontinued operations. See discussion below and Note 22 for further discussion.\n\nThe revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.\n\nRevenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, churn was approximately 2% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment, as discussed below.\n\nWe expect that our churn rate in our U.S. &amp; Canada property segment will remain elevated through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020.\n\nProperty Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.\n\nThe primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:\n\n- Growth in tenant billings, including:\n- New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ('colocations') and lease amendments;\n- Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and\n- New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n- Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations on existing leases, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases and increased interconnection services and solutions.\n- Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases ('pass-through'), straight-line revenue and decommissioning, partially offset, in certain cases, by revenue reserve provisions.\n\nWe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their ex isting networks, while also deploying nex t generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives.",

Given SPG's exposure to similar market conditions and tenant behaviors\u2014especially among anchor tenants\u2014this increase in lease modifications at AMT could signal a broader industry shift toward tenant-favorable terms.

Any lease m odification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges. C ertain other tenants are entitled to m odify the econom ic or other term s of, or term inate, their existing leases with us in the event of such closures. Additionally, corporate m erger or consolidation activity am ong departm ent stores and other national retailers typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations.\n\nI f  a  departm ent  store  or  large  nationally  recognized  tenant  were  to  close  its  stores  at  our  properties,  we  m ay  experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store, at attractive rates, or at all. Additionally, departm ent store or tenant closures m ay result in decreased custom er traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. I f the reported sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse econom ic conditions or other reasons, tenants m ay be unable to pay their m inim um  rents or expense recovery charges. I n the event of any default by a tenant, we m ay not be able to fully recover, and/or m ay experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, am ounts due to us under the term s of our leases with such parties.\n\n## We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.\n\nBankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations. Although we have not seen a significant increase in tenant bankruptcies in the last few years, in previous years a num ber of com panies in the retail industry, including certain of our tenants, declared bankruptcy. I f a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant m ay have the right to reject and term inate one or m ore of its leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm  one or m ore of its leases and continue to m ake rental paym ents to us in a tim ely manner. A bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from  evicting this tenant, and bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from  that tenant, or from  their property, unless we receive an order perm itting us to do so from  the bankruptcy  court.  I n  addition,  we  cannot  evict  a  tenant  solely  because  of  its  bankruptcy.  I f  a  lease  is  assum ed  by  the  tenant  in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease m ust be paid to us in full. I f a lease is rejected, the unsecured claim  we hold against a bankrupt tenant m ight be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the sam e percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claim s, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that lim it the am ount of the claim  we can m ake if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claim s we hold. I n addition, we m ay m ake lease m odifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them  to continue as a going concern. F urtherm ore, we m ay be required to incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space form erly  leased  to  the  bankrupt  tenant.  W e  continually  seek  to  re-lease  vacant  spaces  resulting  from   tenant  term inations.  T he bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with m ultiple locations, m ay require a substantial redevelopm ent of its space, the success of which cannot be assured, and m ay m ake the re-tenanting of its space difficult and costly. Any such bankruptcies  also  m ake  it  m ore  difficult  to  lease  the  rem ainder  of  the  space  at  the  affected  property  or  properties.  F uture  tenant bankruptcies m ay strain our resources and im pact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could m aterially and adversely affect us.\n\n## Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nCertain  of  our  properties  have  had  vacant  space  available  for  prospective  tenants,  and  those  properties  m ay  continue  to experience, and other properties m ay com m ence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. Am ong other causes, (1) an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers, as well as store closures m ay occur, and (2) there m ay be lower demand  from   retail  tenants  for  space,  due  to  certain  retailers  increasing  their  use  of  e-com m erce  websites  to  distribute  their merchandise. As a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, there m ay be downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining power m ay also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant im provem ents and potentially m ake other lease m odifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all.\n\nWe may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate m ix of tenants that generates optim al custom er traffic. Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the prem ises m ay not be relet or the term s of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, m ay be less favorable than the current lease term s. T enant preferences for properties m ay also change over tim e, lik e recent trends towards right-sizing portfolios, repositioning space and locations and pursuing new store concepts, and our properties m ay no longer align with such preferences. I f we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties that offer diversified categories and uses, such as retail, specialty entertainm ent, restaurants, and health and wellness, and that keep up with evolving custom er preferences, our properties m ay not appeal to the com m unities they serve.

      "answer": "AMT pays a current margin of 1.000% over EURIBOR for its borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, 2021 Credit Facility, and 2021 Term Loan. SPG, on the other hand, pays SOFR plus 72.5 basis points (0.725%) under its Supplemental Facility, which includes a spread adjustment due to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. Since EURIBOR and SOFR are both benchmark rates, the key difference lies in the margins applied based on each company's credit ratings. AMT's margin is significantly higher at 1.000% compared to SPG's 0.725%, indicating that AMT faces a higher cost of borrowing in this context. This comparison highlights how credit ratings and lender risk assessments directly influence the effective interest rates and overall financing costs for real estate companies relying on variable-rate debt.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT's current margin over EURIBOR is 1.000% for borrowings under its credit facilities.",

      "answer": "The risk of reduced consumer foot traffic at SPG's properties, caused by safety concerns and a shift toward e-commerce, could lead to lower occupancy rates and reduced leasing rates for tenants. This would directly impact AMT's property revenue, which was $9,933.5 million in 2024, as AMT depends on stable tenant operations and lease renewals to maintain and grow revenue. If SPG's tenants underperform due to lower foot traffic, they may downsize or vacate spaces, reducing AMT\u2019s leasing opportunities and overage rent collections, thereby slowing revenue growth.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's 2024 property revenue is $9,933.5 million, indicating a key metric for its financial performance.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG notes that safety concerns and shifts to e-commerce may reduce consumer foot traffic, impacting tenant leasing and reported sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If SPG's tenants experience reduced sales due to lower foot traffic, they may downsize, delay renewals, or close stores, which would reduce AMT\u2019s leasing opportunities and overage rent collections, directly affecting AMT's property revenue growth."

Additionally, an oversupply of space in the trade areas in which our properties operate could reduce m arket rents, negatively im pacting the term s upon which we lease our properties. T o the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nActs of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity, actual or threatened terrorist attacks and inappropriate and unacceptable behavior by consumers at our properties could adversely affect our business operations.\n\nBecause our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest and crim inal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that m ay be beyond our control or ability to prevent, and recently there has been an increased risk of organized retail crim e and physical violence, the severity and frequency of which varies by m arket and location. I f any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face m aterial dam age physically and reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively im pacted. C onsum ers m ay also perceive a heightened threat of these risks due to increased crim e in certain m arkets and negative m edia attention. C oncern around safety risk m ay im pact the willingness of consum ers, tenants and tenants' em ployees to shop and/or work at our properties, which could result in decreased consum er foot traffic and decreased reported sales at our properties, directly and indirectly im pacting our revenue and overall asset value.\n\nWe face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.\n\nOur  properties  com pete  with  other  form s  of  retailing  such  as  pure  online  retail  websites  as  well  as  other  types  of  retail properties  such  as  single  user  freestanding  discounters  (C ostco,  W alm art  and  T arget).  I n  addition,  m any  of  our  tenants  are  om nichannel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales and provide options to consum ers like buy online pick up in store, buy online ship to store or buy online return to store. O ur business currently is predom inantly reliant on consum er dem and for shopping at physical stores, and our business could be m aterially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consum er purchasing habits.  T he  increased  popularity  of  digital  and  m obile  technologies  has  accelerated  the transition  of  a  percentage  of  m arket  share  from   shopping  at  physical  stores  to  web-based  shopping. Although  a  brick-and-m ortar presence m ay have a positive im pact on retailers' online sales, the increased utilization of pure online shopping m ay lead to the closure of underperform ing stores by retailers, which could im pact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. Additionally, the increase in online shopping m ay result in certain tenants underreporting sales at our properties which m ay materially and adversely im pact our collection of overage rent. E xam ples m ay include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up  sales  or  online  sales  fulfilled  with  store  inventory,  and  tenants  reducing  reported  store  sales  by  including  online  returns processed in the store\n\nEpidemics, pandemics or other public health crisis, and governmental reactions thereto, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants' business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our  ability  to  access  the  capital  markets,  satisfy  our  debt  service  obligations  and  make  distributions  to  our shareholders.\n\nEpidem ics, pandem ics or other health crises could have, a m aterial negative im pact on econom ic and m arket conditions around the  world  and  an  adverse  im pact  on  econom ic  activity  in  retail  real  estate.

The total square footage from SPG's new leases in 2024 exceeded that of 2023 by 2.6 million square feet (13.5 million - 10.9 million).

Therefore, the effective net inflow from these entities was $155,412.

      "answer": "AMT experienced a 10% year-over-year increase in property revenue in Europe, indicating positive performance in that region. In contrast, SPG faces multiple risks that negatively impact property revenue, such as reduced consumer foot traffic due to safety concerns, increased crime, and negative media attention. These risks could lead to decreased reported sales at SPG properties and lower occupancy levels, directly contradicting the positive trend seen by AMT in Europe.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - While AMT's European properties are performing well with a measurable revenue increase, SPG's exposure to consumer behavior risks threatens its property revenue, creating a direct contrast in outcomes for the same type of financial metric across two real estate companies."

Additionally, an oversupply of space in the trade areas in which our properties operate could reduce m arket rents, negatively im pacting the term s upon which we lease our properties. T o the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nActs of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity, actual or threatened terrorist attacks and inappropriate and unacceptable behavior by consumers at our properties could adversely affect our business operations.\n\nBecause our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest and crim inal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that m ay be beyond our control or ability to prevent, and recently there has been an increased risk of organized retail crim e and physical violence, the severity and frequency of which varies by m arket and location. I f any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face m aterial dam age physically and reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively im pacted. C onsum ers m ay also perceive a heightened threat of these risks due to increased crim e in certain m arkets and negative m edia attention. C oncern around safety risk m ay im pact the willingness of consum ers, tenants and tenants' em ployees to shop and/or work at our properties, which could result in decreased consum er foot traffic and decreased reported sales at our properties, directly and indirectly im pacting our revenue and overall asset value.\n\nWe face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.\n\nOur  properties  com pete  with  other  form s  of  retailing  such  as  pure  online  retail  websites  as  well  as  other  types  of  retail properties  such  as  single  user  freestanding  discounters  (C ostco,  W alm art  and  T arget).  I n  addition,  m any  of  our  tenants  are  om nichannel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales and provide options to consum ers like buy online pick up in store, buy online ship to store or buy online return to store. O ur business currently is predom inantly reliant on consum er dem and for shopping at physical stores, and our business could be m aterially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consum er purchasing habits.  T he  increased  popularity  of  digital  and  m obile  technologies  has  accelerated  the transition  of  a  percentage  of  m arket  share  from   shopping  at  physical  stores  to  web-based  shopping. Although  a  brick-and-m ortar presence m ay have a positive im pact on retailers' online sales, the increased utilization of pure online shopping m ay lead to the closure of underperform ing stores by retailers, which could im pact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. Additionally, the increase in online shopping m ay result in certain tenants underreporting sales at our properties which m ay materially and adversely im pact our collection of overage rent. E xam ples m ay include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up  sales  or  online  sales  fulfilled  with  store  inventory,  and  tenants  reducing  reported  store  sales  by  including  online  returns processed in the store\n\nEpidemics, pandemics or other public health crisis, and governmental reactions thereto, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants' business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our  ability  to  access  the  capital  markets,  satisfy  our  debt  service  obligations  and  make  distributions  to  our shareholders.\n\nEpidem ics, pandem ics or other health crises could have, a m aterial negative im pact on econom ic and m arket conditions around the  world  and  an  adverse  im pact  on  econom ic  activity  in  retail  real  estate.  G overnm ents  and  other  authorities  could  respond  to epidem ics, pandem ics or other health crises, by im posing or re-im posing m easures intended to control the spread of disease, including restrictions  on  freedom   of  m ovem ent,  group  gatherings  and  business  operations  such  as  travel  bans,  border  closings,  business closures, quarantines, stay-at-hom e, shelter-in-place orders, density lim itations and social distancing m easures. Although we cannot determ ine the severity of any such m easures in the future, which depend on the governm ent's recognition of the negative im pacts on local  com m unities  and  infrastructure  resulting  from   future  m andates  and  associated  governm ent  responses,  any  restrictions  could negatively im pact us, our tenants and consum er behavior.\n\nDemand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform  obligations under leases, and the willingness of custom ers to visit our properties. E ven without strict governm ental restrictions, the willingness of consum ers to visit our properties m ay be reduced and our tenants' businesses adversely affected, based upon m any factors, including local transm ission rates of disease, the developm ent, availability, distribution, effectiveness and acceptance of existing and new vaccines, the effectiveness and availability of cures or treatm ents, and overall sensitivity to risks associated with the transm ission of diseases. I n addition, som e of our properties are located at or within a close proxim ity to tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants' businesses m ay be heavily and adversely im pacted by reductions in travel and tourism  resulting from  travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel.",

The absence of a concrete figure from SPG suggests a different reporting structure or potentially a smaller or more stable asset base, whereas AMT's explicit depreciation figure indicates a larger or more actively managed portfolio.

This means AMT provides a concrete financial figure representing a significant portion of its operating expenses, while SPG offers no quantifiable data on depreciation, making it impossible to assess the financial impact or strategic implications of SPG\u2019s depreciation practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT reported $1,879.6 million in real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion for 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG\u2019s filing only includes a high-level table of contents entry for 'Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' without any actual figures or details.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT provides a specific, quantifiable depreciation expense, while SPG\u2019s disclosure is non-specific and lacks financial metrics, preventing comparative analysis of their depreciation strategies."

      "answer": "AMT explicitly excludes real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion from its segment gross margin calculation, while SPG reports these costs under 'Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' as part of its asset valuation. This means AMT's gross margin metric appears higher because it does not include these costs, whereas SPG's asset values reflect the capitalized costs of depreciation. The difference in reporting leads to a discrepancy in how each company presents its financial performance, with AMT showing a potentially more favorable margin metric by excluding these expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMT's 10-K filing, we learn that segment gross margin excludes real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, meaning these costs are not factored into their margin calculations.",
        "Step 2: From SPG's 10-K filing, we see that depreciation is included in the 'Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' section, indicating that these costs are capitalized and reflected in asset valuation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in treatment means AMT's gross margin is not directly comparable to SPG's, as AMT removes depreciation-related costs from its metric, while SPG includes them in asset valuation, affecting how each company's financial health is perceived."

These advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and, as a result, we may lose existing or potential data center customers, incur costs to improve our data centers or be forced to reduce our rental rates. These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year.\n\n## Competition to build or purchase assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria.\n\nWe may experience increased competition for contracts to build or acquire communications infrastructure assets, which could cause us to lose such contracts or make them significantly more costly. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria or less stringent contractual terms than we have. In addition, we may not anticipate or be able to address increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the build or acquisition of the same assets. Higher prices or less favorable terms for the construction or acquisition of assets or the failure to build or otherwise add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## New technologies or changes, or lack thereof, in our or a customer's business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.\n\nThe development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer's business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our customers' network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers' network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites.\n\nMoreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Similarly, our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house or due to the development of new technology, such as artificial intelligence, which is potentially more power-intensive, that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities may not be designed to provide. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer's business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform ex pansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nAdditionally, our customers may overestimate or overvalue the benefits and use of 5G networks and other new technology that are deployed onto our communications sites that, in turn, could adversely affect our customers' growth, thereby adversely affecting our growth.\n\n## Divestitures and strategic partnerships may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nWe continually evaluate the performance, capital needs and strategic fit of all of our businesses and, as a result of such evaluation, may sell some or all of the equity interests in a particular business or components of a business.

This assessment can influence our decisions on future capital allocation priorities between certain countries and assets, and may result in our decision to divest a portion, or all, of certain assets, including our Mex ico fiber and Poland businesses in 2023, and our Australia, India and New Zealand businesses in 2024, and repurpose proceeds, and potential future capital, to other capital priorities.\n\n- Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions.\n- Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others.\n- Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have ex cess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital ex penditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs.\n\n## International Strategy\n\nWe believe that, in certain international markets, we can create value by ex panding our existing, communications real estate leasing business, and leveraging our shared global experience, capabilities and services, to deliver a best-in-class offering for our customers and attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others:\n\n- Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, and on an ongoing basis as we evaluate our portfolio, we conduct an extensive review of the country's historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime.\n- Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country's wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry's pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions.\n- Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nTowers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission ('FCC') and the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA'), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders.\n\nCertain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration and permitting.\n\nIn Africa &amp; APAC, our subsidiaries in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications",

      "question": "How does AMT's strategy to increase occupancy of its communications real estate portfolio relate to the high occupancy rates observed in SPG's premium outlet properties, and what combined impact might this have on their respective real estate investment returns?",
      "answer": "AMT aims to increase the occupancy of its existing communications real estate portfolio to enhance returns and meet growing wireless infrastructure demand, particularly driven by 5G deployments in the U.S. and advanced network technologies internationally. This aligns with SPG's high occupancy rates (e.g., 99.8%, 99.1%, and 100.0% at several of its premium outlets), indicating strong tenant demand in the retail real estate sector. Both companies benefit from maximizing property utilization to drive revenue. Given AMT's focus on increasing tenancy and SPG's demonstrated success in maintaining near-full occupancy, both companies are likely to see improved investment returns through higher leasing income and asset value appreciation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's operational strategy explicitly states a focus on increasing occupancy of its communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity and drive returns.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG's premium outlet properties show consistently high occupancy rates (e.g., 99.8%, 99.1%, and 100.0%) across multiple locations, indicating strong tenant retention and demand.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG rely on high occupancy to maximize returns on real estate assets; AMT's stated growth strategy aligns with SPG's demonstrated success in maintaining high occupancy, suggesting a shared mechanism for improving investment returns through increased utilization."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Strategy\n\n## Operational Strategy\n\nAs wireless communications technologies advance and the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to facilitate ever growing network demand. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our ex isting communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in, and selectively grow, our communications real estate portfolio and service offerings, including through platform expansion initiatives, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our customers' needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we ex pect to ex plore new opportunities to enhance or ex tend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers, or to existing customers for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency.\n\n- Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by ongoing 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our ex isting communications sites.\n- Invest in and selectiv ely grow  our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers' needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, acquisitions and platform expansion initiatives. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through our acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite,' and the acquisition, the 'CoreSite Acquisition') in late 2021, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n- Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing sustainable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and power as a service (PaaS) initiatives.\n- Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2024, had $12.0 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\n\n## Capital Allocation Strategy\n\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for tax ation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT tax able income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. On an ongoing basis, we also perform a comprehensive assessment of our global operations to ensure our portfolio is positioned to drive sustained growth",

      "answer": "AMT's $11.9 million payable reflects short-term obligations from its 2024 acquisitions, indicating a strategy of deferring payments for infrastructure investments. Meanwhile, SPG's $127.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses suggests a broader working capital financing approach, potentially supporting operational expenses or acquisitions. Together, these figures imply that while both companies are managing liabilities in the context of real estate growth, they differ in the scale and application of short-term obligations.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT has a $11.9 million acquisition-related payable from its infrastructure purchases in 2024.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both liabilities relate to working capital management in the real estate sector, but they reflect different strategies: AMT's focused on acquisition financing and SPG's on broader operational or investment support."

      "question": "How does AMT's strategy to increase occupancy of existing communications sites, including structural upgrades requiring modest capital investment, compare with SPG's approach to evaluating the economic life and depreciation of investment properties, particularly in terms of financial implications for long-term asset utilization?",
      "answer": "AMT aims to increase occupancy of its existing communications real estate portfolio to maximize returns, noting that most towers can be upgraded with relatively modest capital investment to accommodate additional tenants. This strategy focuses on enhancing utilization and ROI by leveraging existing infrastructure, especially in response to growing 5G and 4G deployment demands. In contrast, SPG evaluates the economic life of its investment properties and adjusts depreciation when necessary to reflect a shorter useful life, which directly impacts asset valuation and long-term financial planning. While AMT emphasizes operational efficiency and capital-light upgrades to support occupancy growth, SPG focuses on asset longevity and impairment risk tied to declining occupancy or performance, influencing how each company manages the financial lifecycle of its real estate assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT plans to increase occupancy of existing towers, many of which can be upgraded with 'relatively modest capital investment' to meet tenant demand.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG periodically reviews depreciable lives of investment properties and adjusts them if the economic life is shorter, which affects asset valuation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The comparison highlights how AMT's growth strategy hinges on maximizing asset utilization with minimal investment, while SPG's financial planning incorporates depreciation adjustments based on property performance and expected economic life."

To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our ex isting communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in, and selectively grow, our communications real estate portfolio and service offerings, including through platform expansion initiatives, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our customers' needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we ex pect to ex plore new opportunities to enhance or ex tend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers, or to existing customers for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency.\n\n- Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by ongoing 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our ex isting communications sites.\n- Invest in and selectiv ely grow  our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers' needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, acquisitions and platform expansion initiatives. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through our acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite,' and the acquisition, the 'CoreSite Acquisition') in late 2021, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n- Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing sustainable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and power as a service (PaaS) initiatives.\n- Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2024, had $12.0 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\n\n## Capital Allocation Strategy\n\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for tax ation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT tax able income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. On an ongoing basis, we also perform a comprehensive assessment of our global operations to ensure our portfolio is positioned to drive sustained growth",

      "question": "How does AMT's strategy to increase occupancy of its communications real estate portfolio relate to the high occupancy rates observed in SPG's premium outlet properties, and what combined impact could this have on their respective real estate sectors?",
      "answer": "AMT aims to increase the occupancy of its communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, anticipating growing demand for its communications sites due to ongoing 5G network deployments in the U.S. and more advanced network technologies in international markets. This aligns with SPG's high occupancy rates (e.g., 100% occupancy in properties like Tampa Premium Outlets and Tulsa Premium Outlets), indicating strong tenant retention and demand in the retail real estate sector. The combined impact suggests that both companies are experiencing or anticipating increased demand in their respective real estate sectors, with AMT focusing on wireless infrastructure and SPG on retail outlet spaces, both leveraging high occupancy to drive revenue and return on investment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's operational strategy focuses on increasing the occupancy of its communications real estate portfolio due to growing demand for wireless services and 5G network deployments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG's premium outlet properties, such as Tampa Premium Outlets and Tulsa Premium Outlets, report 100% occupancy, indicating strong demand in the retail real estate sector.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG are experiencing or anticipating increased demand in their respective real estate sectors. AMT's focus on wireless infrastructure aligns with SPG's success in retail outlets, suggesting a broader trend of high occupancy driving growth across different real estate markets."

      "question": "How does the difference in accounts payable and expense management between AMT and SPG in 2024 reflect contrasting approaches to working capital, and what is the combined impact on their cash flow positions?",
      "answer": "AMT reported a decrease in accounts payable of $7.4 million and a significant decrease in expenses of $227.8 million in 2024, indicating a strategy of reducing short-term obligations and operational costs. In contrast, SPG experienced an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenues by $127.2 million in 2024, suggesting a more aggressive working capital strategy that preserved cash by delaying payments. These differences in working capital management directly impacted their respective cash flow positions: SPG\u2019s operating cash flow of $3.81 billion was bolstered by the $127.2 million increase in payables, while AMT\u2019s approach likely reduced its operating cash flow but improved its short-term liquidity position by clearing liabilities. This comparison reveals that AMT focused on liability reduction and cost control, while SPG prioritized cash retention through delayed outflows.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's accounts payable decreased by $7.4 million and expenses decreased by $227.8 million in 2024, indicating a liability and cost reduction strategy.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG\u2019s accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenues, and other liabilities increased by $127.2 million in 2024, showing a working capital strategy that deferred cash outflows.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrasting changes in accounts payable and expense management reflect different approaches to working capital: AMT reduced liabilities and costs, while SPG preserved cash by increasing payables, directly affecting their cash flow dynamics."

      "answer": "The risks outlined by SPG regarding the negative impact of pandemics on retail real estate, including reduced consumer foot traffic, decreased tenant performance, and the potential inability to satisfy debt service obligations, directly influence AMT's forward-looking statements. AMT acknowledges that their substantial leverage and future financing transactions depend on market conditions and tenant performance, both of which are jeopardized by the risks SPG highlights. This creates a causal chain where SPG's exposure to pandemic-related disruptions amplifies AMT's financial risk, particularly in maintaining liquidity and executing future financing strategies.",

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as 'anticipates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects' or similar ex pressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future prospects of growth in the communications infrastructure leasing industry, the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our customers and other competitive and financial pressures, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, the ex pected impacts of strategic partnerships on our business, our expectations for the closing of signed agreements and the expected impacts of such agreements on our business, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future ex penditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, changes in zoning, tax  and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital ex penditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for tax ation as a real estate investment trust ('REIT'), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and technology failures, including cybersecurity and data privacy incidents. These statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.

New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption 'Risk Factors,' may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur.

If AMT\u2019s long-term ground leases were ever disrupted (despite their current security), it could affect tenant operations on those towers, which in turn could impact SPG\u2019s ability to renew retail leases in those locations due to tenant instability or reduced demand for physical retail space near communication infrastructure.",

In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets.\n\n- A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located on a tract of land of up to 20 acres.\n- A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.\n- A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.\n- Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Africa &amp; APAC, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.\n\nU.S. &amp; Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites .

Of the 148,097 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2024, approximately 80% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter longterm ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 56% of the ground leases for our sites have a final ex piration date of 2034 and beyond.\n\nCustomers . Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (19%), AT&amp;T (18%) and Verizon Wireless (13%).\n\nAcross most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 52% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2030 or beyond.\n\nData Centers. We own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2024, our data center portfolio consisted of 29 data center facilities across ten United States markets, across 3.3 million net rentable square feet ('NRSF').\n\nOffices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 100,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. &amp; Canada, Africa &amp; APAC, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.",

      "answer": "Debt service obligations negatively impact both AMT and SPG, but in different ways. AMT faces increased borrowing costs due to elevated interest rates, which reduces cash flow available for REIT distributions and capital expenditures. SPG, on the other hand, is exposed to risks where tenant lease performance may be compromised due to economic disruptions like pandemics or shifts in consumer behavior, which in turn affects its ability to meet debt service obligations. Thus, while AMT is primarily affected through rising financing costs, SPG is impacted through reduced revenue from tenant underperformance, both ultimately straining their capacity to manage debt obligations.",

Any divestiture we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may also result in a diversion of management's attention, operational difficulties and losses. Divestitures and our evaluation of assets or businesses in connection with potential divestitures may result in asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, or losses realized in connection with a transaction, which could have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, as we continue to engage in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to ex ecute buyouts of our partners' interests.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Financial Performance or General E conomic Conditions\n\nOur leverage and debt service obligations, including during a high interest rates environment, may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and may reduce funds available to satisfy our distribution requirements.\n\nOur leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:\n\n- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions;\n- impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured;\n- limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring or building assets; and\n- limiting our flex ibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital ex penditures, future growth and ex pansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners' interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\n\nFurther, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as inflation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. Federal fund rates have been elevated for several years and, although there were several rate cuts in 2024, rates could remain at current elevated levels for an ex tended period of time. Such elevated rates have a corresponding impact to our costs of borrowing and may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds through the offering of our securities or through the issuance of debt due to higher debt capital costs, diminished credit availability and less favorable equity markets. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation.\n\n## High inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\n\nThe United States and other large global economies experienced historically high inflation in recent years. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, changes in trade policies, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, as well as ongoing global military conflicts. Inflation can materially and adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should",

      "question": "What is the combined value of assets under encumbrances for AMT's data centers and SPG's Southridge Mall property, and how does this total compare to the gross amount carried for these assets at the close of the reporting period?",
      "answer": "$6,309.9 million for AMT's data centers and $156,653 thousand for SPG's Southridge Mall property are reported under encumbrances. The combined encumbered asset value is $6,466.55 million. This represents a small fraction of the total gross amount carried at the close of the reporting period, which is $21,929.3 million for AMT and $156,653 thousand for SPG. The disparity highlights how only a portion of the companies' real estate holdings are encumbered, suggesting conservative financial strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMT's filing, extract the encumbrances value for data centers, which is $6,309.9 million.",
        "Step 2: From SPG's filing, extract the encumbrances value for the Southridge Mall property, which is $156,653 thousand.",
        "Step 3: Convert SPG's encumbrances value to millions ($156.653 million) for unit consistency.",
        "Step 4: Add AMT and SPG encumbered values: $6,309.9 million + $156.653 million = $6,466.55 million.",

        "Step 6: Conclude that encumbrances represent a small portion of the total asset value, indicating potentially cautious financial leverage."

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently impact their tax liabilities, and what percentage of their international and domestic operations, respectively, are affected by these tax implications?",
      "answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and uses TRSs for certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. As of December 31, 2023, AMT's REIT-qualified businesses included most of its operations in Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda. This implies that earnings from its TRSs are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, which affects its international tax liabilities. On the other hand, SPG notes that its ownership of TRSs is limited to 20% of the value of its total assets, and it must ensure transactions with TRSs are conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms to avoid a 100% excise tax. This constraint impacts SPG's flexibility in managing its domestic operations. Therefore, AMT's TRS-related tax liability primarily affects its international operations, while SPG's TRS-related compliance requirements constrain its domestic investment decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT operates as a REIT and pays U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its TRSs, with REIT-qualified businesses including most operations in Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG must ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs and that transactions with TRSs are conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms to avoid a 100% excise tax.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s TRS-related tax liability affects its international operations, while SPG\u2019s TRS-related compliance restricts its domestic investment flexibility, showing how TRSs differently influence their tax and operational strategies."

      "question": "How does the structure of AMT's tenant leases, including fixed escalation percentages and penalties for early termination, potentially mitigate the leasing risks SPG faces due to external factors like e-commerce growth and public health crises?",
      "answer": "AMT's tenant leases, which include fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index-based rent increases, along with financial penalties for early termination, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream by discouraging tenants from terminating leases prematurely. This contrasts with SPG's exposure to leasing risks from e-commerce growth and public health crises, which can reduce consumer foot traffic, lower tenant performance, and result in store closures or underreported sales. AMT's lease structure could serve as a risk mitigation strategy for SPG if applied, as it would reduce the impact of tenant turnover and rent volatility caused by these external threats.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, AMT\u2019s leases include fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index-based rent increases and financial penalties for early termination, which disincentivize tenants from ending leases early.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, SPG faces leasing risks due to e-commerce growth, shifting consumer behavior, and public health crises that can reduce tenant occupancy, lower rent collection, and negatively impact property revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT's lease structure helps maintain lease continuity and predictable revenue, which directly addresses SPG's vulnerabilities related to tenant turnover and occupancy risk caused by external market forces."

      "question": "How does the difference in lease dependency and churn risk between AMT and SPG affect their respective revenue stability and tenant demand outlook?",
      "answer": "AMT generates over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue due to long-term contracts with wireless carriers and a 3% average annual rent escalation, combined with a 3% churn rate, which ensures consistent revenue growth and low cash flow volatility. In contrast, SPG faces significant uncertainty in tenant leasing due to risks like oversupply reducing market rents, e-commerce competition impacting occupancy rates, and safety concerns affecting consumer foot traffic. These factors expose SPG to higher tenant turnover and lower leasing demand, making its revenue outlook more volatile compared to AMT\u2019s stable and predictable revenue base.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT expects over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue with long-term leases and 3% average annual rent escalation, and a churn rate of 3%.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG faces risks including oversupply, e-commerce competition, safety concerns, and potential tenant turnover, which can reduce leasing demand and occupancy rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s long-term leases and low churn ensure revenue stability, while SPG\u2019s exposure to market volatility and tenant risk leads to less predictable revenue."

      "question": "How does the failure of subsidiary REITs to qualify as REITs impact both AMT's and SPG's ability to maintain compliance with REIT income and asset tests, and what financial consequences could each company face under these scenarios?",
      "answer": "If subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as REITs, both AMT and SPG would face significant financial and compliance consequences. For AMT, the ownership of shares in such subsidiary REITs would fail to be qualifying assets under REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains from the subsidiary would no longer count toward the 75% gross income test. This could materially affect AMT\u2019s ability to maintain its own REIT status. Additionally, AMT would economically bear the federal income tax, penalties, and interest incurred by the subsidiary REIT. For SPG, failure of its subsidiary REITs to qualify would similarly disrupt its REIT compliance, particularly regarding income sourcing and asset composition, and could result in corporate-level taxes and a 4% nondeductible excise tax if distributions fall short. Both companies face liquidity constraints and reduced flexibility in executing their business strategies due to the mandatory distribution requirements tied to REIT status.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMT's filing - If a subsidiary REIT fails to qualify, AMT would no longer treat its shares as qualifying assets, and dividend income would not count toward the 75% gross income test.",
        "Step 2: Extract from AMT's filing - AMT would bear the economic burden of taxes, penalties, and interest from the failed subsidiary REIT.",
        "Step 3: Extract from SPG's filing - SPG must distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income; failure of subsidiary REITs to qualify could disrupt income composition and asset tests.",
        "Step 4: Extract from SPG's filing - If distributions fall short, SPG could face a 4% nondeductible excise tax and corporate-level taxes on undistributed income.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both companies rely on subsidiary REITs to maintain REIT compliance; failure of these entities threatens their own REIT status, financial flexibility, and liquidity."

      "answer": "SPG spent $328 million on redevelopments and expansions in 2023, while AMT spent $481.0 million on redevelopments. This results in a difference of -$153 million, meaning AMT spent more on redevelopments than SPG. This difference reflects distinct capital allocation strategies: AMT prioritized redevelopments as a significant portion of its $1,829.8 million in total capital expenditures, whereas SPG diversified its $793 million in total spending across multiple categories, with redevelopments and expansions making up a smaller portion of its overall capital strategy.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the difference - $328 million (SPG) minus $481.0 million (AMT) equals -$153 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The spending difference reflects different capital strategies: AMT allocated a larger portion of its capital to redevelopments, while SPG spread its capital across multiple categories including new developments, tenant allowances, and operational expenditures."

      "answer": "The 20% asset limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG from investing more than that percentage of their total asset value in taxable REIT subsidiaries. For AMT, this limitation hinders its ability to expand non-real estate activities and invest in businesses conducted by its TRSs. Similarly, SPG must monitor its TRS investments to ensure compliance, limiting its flexibility to pursue otherwise attractive investments. Together, this regulatory constraint reduces both companies' capacity to diversify into non-qualifying assets and constrains strategic shifts in their business models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT is limited to 20% of its asset value being represented by securities of one or more TRSs, which hinders its ability to invest in non-qualifying assets and expand non-real estate activities.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG must ensure that not more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs, which limits its flexibility to pursue attractive investments.",

      "answer": "AMT experienced a significant increase in operating lease modifications and reassessments in 2023, rising from $80.5 million in 2022 to $405.9 million in 2023, indicating a substantial change in lease terms or conditions. This increase could suggest either renegotiations or adjustments that may have improved tenant retention or adapted to market pressures. In contrast, SPG explicitly notes that lease modifications initiated by tenants under pressure (e.g., due to macroeconomic conditions or competition from e-commerce) are likely to be unfavorable to the lessor and could reduce lease income. Therefore, while AMT's increased lease modifications might reflect proactive portfolio management, SPG's disclosures suggest that such modifications carry the risk of negatively impacting lease income, particularly in a retail environment where tenant performance is under pressure. This creates a nuanced view where lease modifications can be both a strategic tool and a financial risk depending on context and execution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT's operating lease modifications and reassessments increased from $80.5M in 2022 to $405.9M in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG notes that lease modifications initiated by tenants under financial stress are likely to be unfavorable and reduce lease income.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in lease modifications at AMT could reflect market pressures similar to those described by SPG, but the impact on AMT\u2019s financials depends on whether these modifications were proactive or reactive and favorable or unfavorable."

      "question": "How does the $11,001.2 million in property revenue reported by AMT in 2023 contrast with the risks SPG faces that could negatively impact its own property revenue, and what are the potential implications for their respective financial performance?",
      "answer": "AMT reported $11,001.2 million in property revenue for 2023, showing strong performance and stability in its revenue streams. In contrast, SPG faces several risks that could negatively impact its property revenue, such as increased competition from e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to safety concerns, and the lingering effects of the pandemic on retail tenant performance. These risks could lead to lower occupancy rates, reduced rental rates, and decreased overage rent collections. As a result, while AMT benefits from a stable revenue base, SPG may experience volatility and potential declines in its property revenue, which could adversely affect its financial performance and asset value.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT's property revenue for 2023 is $11,001.2 million, indicating strong and stable income generation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG faces multiple risks including e-commerce competition, reduced consumer foot traffic, and pandemic-related disruptions that could negatively impact its property revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrast between AMT's strong property revenue and SPG's exposure to revenue-reducing risks highlights differing financial performance outcomes: AMT is positioned for stability, while SPG may face volatility and potential declines."

      "question": "How do lease modifications, as influenced by economic pressures such as inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions for AMT, and by consumer behavior shifts and retail tenant financial instability for SPG, create a compounded negative financial impact on both companies' lease income and growth prospects?",
      "answer": "AMT faces lease modification risks due to economic pressures like inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions, which can lead to customer bankruptcies or lease terminations, reducing demand for communications infrastructure and negatively affecting revenue and growth. SPG experiences similar lease modification pressures from retail tenant financial instability, declining consumer confidence, and shifts toward online shopping, which reduce occupancy rates and rental income. Both companies see their lease income and future growth prospects negatively impacted through these distinct but financially analogous mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT_10k_2023.pdf:page_16:chunk_1: AMT notes that inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions affect customers' ability to raise capital, potentially leading to reduced spending, bankruptcy, or lease terminations, which could materially affect revenue and growth.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG_10k_2023.pdf:page_13:chunk_1: SPG highlights that lease modifications may result from declining consumer confidence, retail tenant financial instability, and increased online shopping, which reduce occupancy and rental income.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG are exposed to lease modifications due to external economic and behavioral factors, which lead to reduced lease income and slower growth. Although the sectors differ (communications vs. retail), the financial impact mechanism is similar: tenant instability \u2192 lease renegotiation or termination \u2192 reduced revenue and growth."

SPG's 10-K highlights multiple risks that can negatively impact property revenue, such as oversupply of retail space reducing market rents, consumer safety concerns reducing foot traffic, and increased e-commerce adoption leading to store closures and lower occupancy rates. These risks apply across AMT's geographically diverse property portfolio, meaning that each region's revenue stream\u2014whether in Europe, Latin America, or elsewhere\u2014is vulnerable to the same causal chain: reduced consumer willingness to shop in physical locations leads to lower tenant leasing interest and occupancy, which in turn reduces overall property revenue. Therefore, SPG's described risks compound across AMT's geographic segments, creating a multi-market threat to property revenue.",

      "answer": "AMT amortizes its acquired intangible assets, including in-place lease value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with a weighted average amortization period of 15 years as of December 31, 2023. SPG also amortizes in-place lease assets over the remaining life of the underlying leases, which could vary but would similarly be impacted by lease terms and renewal assumptions. If both companies applied a uniform 15-year straight-line amortization policy for in-place lease assets regardless of lease term, the financial impact would be standardized amortization charges across both companies, affecting net income and asset carrying values in a comparable manner. This would result in consistent expense recognition patterns over time, though the absolute dollar impact would depend on the initial valuation of the in-place lease assets for each company.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT amortizes intangible assets including in-place leases on a straight-line basis with a weighted average period of 15 years.",

Simon Property Group\u2019s depreciation, estimated at 5.2% of its $54.3 billion real estate asset base, would be approximately $2,823.6 million.

      "answer": "AMT benefits from a leasing model where property revenue is derived from long-term tenant leases with fixed escalation percentages and penalties for early termination, ensuring stable and predictable revenue. In contrast, SPG faces risks such as reduced consumer foot traffic due to e-commerce competition and public health crises like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to store closures and reduced occupancy levels, directly and negatively impacting its property revenue.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's lease arrangements include fixed escalation percentages and penalties for early termination, ensuring stable revenue.",

      "answer": "American Tower Corporation reported $2,834.1 million in real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion for 2023, indicating significant asset consumption and adjustments. Simon Property Group disclosed a capitalized cost amount under their real estate and accumulated depreciation table, which implies capital investments that may reduce immediate depreciation impacts. The difference suggests that American Tower's operational strategy involves assets with higher ongoing depreciation, while Simon Property Group may focus on capital improvements that defer depreciation charges, affecting their respective financial performance and asset management approaches.",

      "answer": "Competitive pressures and lease rate challenges negatively impact both AMT and SPG by reducing their ability to renew leases at favorable rates or maintain current occupancy levels. AMT faces risks from competition in the communications infrastructure sector, where competitors may offer lower pricing or alternative contractual arrangements, potentially leading to lower lease rates and adverse effects on its results of operations. SPG, in the retail real estate sector, is exposed to oversupply of space, which could reduce market rents and negatively affect lease terms. Both companies are vulnerable to long-term lease dependencies\u2014AMT through its reliance on customer financial strength and SPG through its reliance on tenant performance and consumer foot traffic. These factors collectively threaten revenue stability and growth for both companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT faces competition that could materially and adversely affect its lease rates and renewal terms due to alternative contractual arrangements or pricing from peers.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG are exposed to lease rate pressures from external market forces (competition and oversupply), and both rely on long-term leases that are difficult to renegotiate quickly, creating a shared vulnerability to declining lease rates and financial instability."

      "answer": "American Tower Corporation reported real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion of $2,834.1 million in 2023, reflecting significant asset base and ongoing operational costs tied to its real estate holdings. In contrast, Simon Property Group disclosed details on real estate and accumulated depreciation in their 2023 filings, indicating a focus on asset valuation and long-term investment strategy. The difference in their financial disclosures highlights AMT's emphasis on operational adjustments and SPG's focus on real estate valuation, suggesting divergent financial strategies in managing real estate assets.",

      "question": "How does the difference in real estate related depreciation and amortization between American Tower Corporation (AMT) and Simon Property Group (SPG) in 2023 reflect potential differences in their real estate asset bases or operational strategies?",
      "answer": "American Tower Corporation reported $2,834.1 million in real estate related depreciation and amortization for 2023, while Simon Property Group reported $0 in this category but instead provided a breakdown of real estate and accumulated depreciation in thousands of dollars. This stark contrast suggests that AMT's operational model, which includes significant infrastructure assets like communication towers, leads to higher depreciation expenses, whereas SPG's focus on retail real estate may involve different asset classifications or reporting methods. The absence of a direct depreciation figure for SPG indicates a structural or strategic difference in asset management or financial reporting between the two real estate entities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Tower Corporation reported $2,834.1 million in real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion for 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Simon Property Group disclosed a section titled 'Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' but did not explicitly report a depreciation figure, instead listing asset values in thousands of dollars.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The presence of a specific depreciation figure for AMT versus the absence of such a figure for SPG (despite both being real estate companies) indicates differences in asset structure, depreciation practices, or operational focus."

      "question": "How does the difference in occupancy strategies between AMT and SPG reflect in their respective real estate operations and utilization goals, given AMT's focus on increasing communications site occupancy and SPG's disclosed occupancy rates across mall properties?",
      "answer": "AMT focuses on increasing the occupancy of its existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, aiming to maximize returns by leasing additional space on existing sites. This aligns with their belief that the majority of towers have capacity for additional tenants. In contrast, SPG, as evidenced by its 2023 10-K, already maintains high occupancy rates across its mall properties, with most properties exceeding 95% occupancy, such as Arizona Mills at 99.6% and Arundel Mills at 100%. This suggests SPG is already operating near optimal occupancy, while AMT is actively pursuing strategies to increase utilization. The causal mechanism is that AMT's growth strategy hinges on increasing tenancy through network densification and 5G deployment, while SPG\u2019s strategy focuses on maintaining already high occupancy through tenant mix and property enhancements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's operational strategy emphasizes increasing occupancy of existing communications sites to support global connectivity and drive incremental returns.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG's disclosed occupancy rates across its mall properties show high utilization, with most properties above 95% occupancy.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT seeks to grow through increasing underutilized infrastructure occupancy, while SPG maintains already high occupancy in its retail real estate, indicating different strategic focuses within the real estate sector."

      "answer": "AMT focuses on increasing the occupancy of its existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, aiming to achieve higher incremental returns by leasing additional space on existing sites. This is evident in their operational strategy to increase utilization of existing infrastructure. In contrast, SPG discloses occupancy metrics across its retail mall properties, maintaining high occupancy rates (e.g., 99.5% at Lenox Square and 99.6% at La Plaza Mall), which reflects a more mature and stable real estate model. The difference in strategies highlights that AMT is actively pursuing densification and infrastructure expansion to meet growing wireless demand, while SPG emphasizes maintaining high occupancy in a traditional retail real estate context.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's operational strategy emphasizes increasing occupancy on existing communications sites to support global connectivity and achieve higher incremental returns.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG's disclosed occupancy rates (e.g., 99.5% at Lenox Square and 99.6% at La Plaza Mall) indicate a focus on maintaining high occupancy across its retail properties.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT's strategy reflects a growth-oriented approach in infrastructure utilization to meet rising wireless demand, while SPG's high occupancy rates indicate a stable, mature retail real estate model. The difference in occupancy strategies highlights contrasting sector dynamics: AMT focuses on scaling infrastructure to meet new demand, whereas SPG focuses on sustaining occupancy in established properties."

      "answer": "AMT aimed to increase occupancy on its existing communications sites to drive higher returns and meet growing wireless demand, particularly with 5G deployments increasing network densification. This strategy was expected to enhance revenue through higher site utilization. Meanwhile, SPG reported a $286.7 million increase in fixed lease income, partly driven by higher occupancy across its real estate portfolio. The increase in occupancy directly supported SPG\u2019s lease income growth. Therefore, both companies leveraged occupancy increases to boost revenue, though through different mechanisms\u2014AMT through infrastructure utilization and SPG through lease consideration.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT's strategy to increase occupancy of communications sites to support global connectivity and drive incremental returns.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies used occupancy increases to enhance revenue: AMT through infrastructure leasing and SPG through retail lease agreements."

      "answer": "AMT faces material risks due to customer financial weakness, particularly as many of their communications service provider customers operate with substantial debt and may struggle to raise capital due to inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions. This could lead to lease terminations or non-renewals, reducing demand for AMT's infrastructure. SPG, which depends heavily on lease renewals for its retail properties, could face cascading effects if AMT's customers\u2014some of whom may also be SPG's tenants\u2014experience financial distress. This would make it harder for SPG to renew leases or re-lease available space on favorable terms, directly affecting their occupancy rates and cash flows.",

      "answer": "Rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions negatively impact AMT's ability to raise capital through debt financing or refinance existing obligations, which directly affects its capacity to meet debt service obligations. This is compounded by its reliance on a small number of customers, where a failure by a significant tenant like VIL to resume full payments threatens cash flow and liquidity. Similarly, SPG faces risks from external disruptions like pandemics or civil unrest, which reduce consumer foot traffic and tenant lease performance, thereby impacting its ability to generate consistent cash flow and meet debt service obligations. Both companies are exposed to liquidity constraints due to macroeconomic and operational risks, though the specific triggers differ\u2014AMT through capital market volatility and tenant concentration, SPG through retail demand shifts and public health events.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT faces capital market constraints due to rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions, impacting its ability to refinance debt or fund operations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - AMT's liquidity is tied to a small number of customers, and VIL's partial payments threaten cash flow needed for debt service obligations.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - SPG's cash flow is dependent on tenant lease performance, which is vulnerable to public health crises and reduced consumer foot traffic.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG face liquidity risks that could impair their ability to meet debt service obligations, though the mechanisms differ: AMT through capital market and tenant concentration risks, SPG through retail and public health risks."

      "question": "How does the impact of debt service obligations on AMT's financial covenants contrast with the negative impact of public health crises on SPG's ability to satisfy its debt service obligations, and what specific financial risk does this highlight for both companies?",
      "answer": "AMT faces financial covenant risks tied to its debt service obligations, specifically under its Bank Loan Agreements, where failure to meet financial maintenance tests could result in a default and immediate repayment of outstanding debt. AMT currently expects to meet these covenants based on its operating results over the next 12 months. In contrast, SPG's ability to satisfy its debt service obligations is negatively impacted by public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, which can severely restrict consumer foot traffic and tenant performance, reducing revenue and liquidity. This highlights that while AMT's risk is tied to covenant compliance and operational performance metrics, SPG's risk is more externally driven by unpredictable events that directly affect its cash flow and, consequently, its capacity to service debt.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT's debt service obligations are tied to compliance with financial maintenance tests in its Bank Loan Agreements, and failure to comply could result in default and immediate repayment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT believes its operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants over the next 12 months.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG's debt service obligations could be negatively impacted by public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduce consumer foot traffic, tenant performance, and overall revenue.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - While AMT's debt service risk is internally tied to covenant compliance and operational performance, SPG's risk is externally tied to unpredictable public health events that impair cash flow and liquidity."

      "question": "How does the difference in treatment of 'Excess Capital' between AMT and SPG reflect contrasting capital allocation strategies, particularly in relation to stockholder returns and equity structure adjustments?",
      "answer": "AMT explicitly states its intention to return excess capital to stockholders after funding required distributions, capital expenditures, debt repayment, and anticipated future investments. This is evidenced by its divestiture of assets like its Mexico fiber and Poland businesses in 2023 and its Pending ATC TIPL Transaction in early 2024, with proceeds being repurposed to capital priorities. In contrast, SPG's 2023 equity statement shows a net reduction in capital from treasury stock purchases totaling $140,593 thousand and distributions to common stockholders and limited partners of $2,794,781 thousand, indicating a more active use of capital for equity adjustments and distributions rather than a formalized excess capital return policy. This highlights a more reactive or structured equity management approach at SPG versus AMT\u2019s proactive excess capital return strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT explicitly states its intention to return excess capital to stockholders after funding required distributions, capital expenditures, debt repayment, and anticipated future investments, as seen in its 2023 divestitures and the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction in early 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG's 2023 equity statement shows a net reduction in capital from treasury stock purchases totaling $140,593 thousand and distributions to common stockholders and limited partners of $2,794,781 thousand, indicating capital usage for equity adjustments and distributions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT\u2019s stated policy of returning excess capital contrasts with SPG\u2019s actual capital usage for equity adjustments and distributions, suggesting that while both companies manage capital, they do so with different strategic emphasis: AMT focuses on excess capital return post-obligations, while SPG actively adjusts equity structure and distributes capital."

      "answer": "SPG capitalizes improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset, indicating a focus on long-term asset enhancement. AMT, on the other hand, uses cash flows to fund maintenance and improvements, communications site and data center construction, and managed network installations, suggesting a more operational and growth-oriented approach. The interaction implies that SPG emphasizes capital efficiency and asset longevity through selective capitalization, while AMT prioritizes ongoing investment in infrastructure to sustain and grow its operations.",

      "question": "How does the difference in federal income tax treatment between AMT and SPG affect their respective obligations and potential financial impacts, particularly in relation to their REIT status and estimated liabilities?",
      "answer": "AMT, as a REIT, generally avoids U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations due to the dividends paid deduction, but remains subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions. In contrast, SPG must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to maintain REIT status, and if it fails to do so and relief provisions do not apply, it would be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate tax rates. This difference in federal income tax treatment means that SPG faces a higher risk of incurring significant federal tax liabilities if it loses REIT status, while AMT's federal tax exposure is more limited to specific non-REIT earnings and foreign taxes. Additionally, AMT expects a $50 million to $100 million decrease in estimated accretion expense for 2024 due to potential changes in asset retirement obligations, which could further reduce its overall tax-related financial burden.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT, as a REIT, generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on REIT-generated income due to the dividends paid deduction, but remains subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG must distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income to maintain REIT status; if it fails, it would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates, with no REIT election for four years unless failure was due to specific exceptions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in federal income tax treatment creates a stronger compliance imperative for SPG to maintain REIT status to avoid significant federal tax liabilities, whereas AMT\u2019s federal tax exposure is more limited and primarily tied to non-REIT earnings and foreign taxes.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize further - AMT also anticipates a $50 million to $100 million decrease in accretion expense for 2024 due to potential changes in asset retirement obligations, which could reduce its overall financial burden, a detail not mentioned for SPG, highlighting a specific financial impact tied to AMT\u2019s operations and tax structure."

      "question": "How does maintaining investment-grade credit ratings influence AMT's liquidity position and SPG's capital strategy, and what is the combined effect on their ability to fund growth initiatives in 2023?",
      "answer": "AMT maintained $9.6 billion in available liquidity as of December 31, 2023, which it attributes in part to its investment-grade credit ratings that provide consistent access to capital markets. SPG emphasizes preserving its investment-grade credit ratings as a core component of its capital strategy, which includes access to multiple financing tools such as a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion global commercial paper program. Together, these credit profiles enable both companies to fund growth initiatives\u2014AMT through asset growth and operational excellence, and SPG through redevelopment, acquisitions, and international expansion\u2014demonstrating how investment-grade ratings support scalable and flexible capital deployment in the real estate sector.",

      "question": "How does the combination of high interest rates and restrictive covenants impact AMT and SPG's ability to access capital and execute on growth opportunities, and by how much could their debt service obligations constrain cash flow available for development or acquisitions?",
      "answer": "Both AMT and SPG face constrained access to capital due to high interest rates and restrictive covenants in their debt agreements. AMT notes that rising inflation and interest rates have increased its cost of capital and could lead to an extended economic downturn, reducing its ability to incur debt or access capital. Additionally, restrictive covenants in its securitization transactions and credit facilities limit its ability to incur additional debt, make distributions, or engage in mergers and acquisitions. Similarly, SPG has $26.2 billion in consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness as of December 31, 2023, which requires substantial cash flows for debt service, limiting its ability to fund business growth. Restrictive covenants in SPG\u2019s debt agreements also constrain its ability to pursue advantageous transactions. These combined pressures significantly reduce both companies\u2019 flexibility to fund new developments or acquisitions using either internal cash flows or external financing.",

        "Step 5: Synthesize - Both companies face reduced access to capital due to high interest rates and restrictive covenants, which limit their ability to fund growth through internal cash flows or external financing."

AMT stated it expects to fund further stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, and borrowings under its credit facilities.

Simon Property Group (SPG) distributed $7.45 per unit in 2023, showing a concrete commitment to REIT compliance. AMT emphasizes flexibility, noting that distributions depend on factors like financial condition, debt limitations, and NOL utilization, suggesting a cautious, liquidity-preserving approach. In contrast, SPG\u2019s specific per-unit distribution indicates a more transparent and shareholder-focused strategy. Together, these approaches highlight differing priorities: AMT prioritizes operational flexibility and tax management, while SPG emphasizes consistent, predictable returns to investors.",

This redemption activity is directly tied to its distribution policy, which ensures sufficient cash flows to maintain Simon\u2019s REIT qualification by managing liquidity and capital structure. By redeeming units, the partnership can adjust its capital base, which in turn affects the distribution of taxable income to remaining unit holders, supporting the company's compliance with the REIT requirement to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income annually.",

      "question": "How does AMT's REIT distribution policy interact with SPG's accrual of distributions to influence their respective financial reporting practices regarding shareholder returns?",
      "answer": "AMT, as a REIT, is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually to maintain its tax-advantaged status, and it expects to continue distributing all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after considering the utilization of net operating losses. This policy directly affects how AMT manages its taxable income and cash flows, with distribution decisions being influenced by financial condition, debt limitations, and the ability to utilize NOLs. Meanwhile, SPG accrues distributions when they are declared, aligning its financial reporting with the timing of declared shareholder returns. This means that while AMT focuses on mandatory distribution requirements tied to REIT status, SPG focuses on accrual accounting for distributions, which affects the timing and recognition of shareholder returns in its financial statements. The interaction highlights how both companies manage shareholder returns under different financial reporting and regulatory frameworks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMT's 10-K - AMT must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually and considers NOLs when determining distributions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - AMT's mandatory distribution policy under REIT rules influences its financial planning and cash flow management, while SPG's accrual policy affects the timing of financial recognition of distributions. Both approaches shape their respective financial reporting practices around shareholder returns."

      "question": "How do AMT and SPG differ in their treatment of distributions in relation to REIT taxable income and partnership distributions, based on their respective disclosures?",
      "answer": "AMT uses cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of REIT taxable income to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, while SPG accrues distributions when they are declared and specifically notes the taxable nature of dividends and Operating Partnership distributions. This indicates that AMT emphasizes the operational use of cash for REIT compliance, whereas SPG focuses on the timing and tax characterization of distributions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMT\u2019s disclosure, we learn that the company uses cash flows to fund distributions, including those of REIT taxable income, which is necessary to maintain REIT status.",
        "Step 2: From SPG\u2019s disclosure, we see that distributions are accrued when declared and that the company provides a breakdown of the taxable nature of dividends and Operating Partnership distributions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, the difference lies in how each company emphasizes the function and timing of distributions \u2014 AMT focuses on the operational funding and REIT compliance, while SPG focuses on the tax treatment and accrual timing."

      "answer": "The combined total gross value of assets with specified encumbrances for AMT and SPG is $175,737.7 million. AMT\u2019s depreciation strategy focuses on a broader portfolio of 218,353 sites and 27 data centers with varying depreciation lives (up to 20\u201340 years), while SPG\u2019s strategy centers on premium outlet properties with shorter-term depreciation horizons, particularly in high-traffic retail locations. This leads to SPG having a higher proportion of accumulated depreciation relative to total assets, indicating a more aggressive depreciation approach compared to AMT.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT reports a gross amount of $20,394.7 million for 218,353 sites and $3,554.2 million for 27 data centers, with depreciation lives of up to 20 and 40 years respectively.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG reports multiple properties with total gross values ranging from $35,643 million (Gulfport Premium Outlets) to $458,310 million (Desert Hills Premium Outlets), with a combined total gross value of $155,343 million across all listed properties.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine AMT\u2019s $20,394.7 million and $3,554.2 million with SPG\u2019s $155,343 million to calculate the total gross value of $175,737.7 million.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Analyze how the differing asset portfolios influence depreciation strategies: AMT\u2019s larger number of sites and longer depreciation lives suggest a more conservative approach, while SPG\u2019s premium outlet focus and shorter depreciation lives indicate a more aggressive depreciation strategy."

      "question": "How much total combined indebtedness did AMT and SPG disclose as of December 31, 2021, and what impact did their respective debt structures have on their liquidity and ability to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2021, AMT disclosed total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion, while SPG reported consolidated mortgage and unsecured indebtedness of approximately $209.9 million in pro rata payment guarantees and multiple variable-rate loans with interest rate floors and caps. AMT funded its acquisitions and capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations, credit facilities, and debt issuances, indicating strong liquidity. SPG\u2019s variable-rate debt structure with interest rate floors and caps suggests exposure to interest rate risk, which could affect future interest expenses and liquidity if rates rise, potentially limiting flexibility in funding acquisitions or capital projects.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT reported total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, and used cash flow from operations, credit facilities, and debt issuances to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG disclosed variable-rate loans with interest rate floors and caps, and its share of total indebtedness included a pro rata share of mortgage debt on joint venture properties, with approximately $209.9 million of payment guarantees.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The combined total indebtedness of AMT and SPG as of December 31, 2021, was $43.7 billion. AMT\u2019s diversified funding sources supported its acquisition strategy, while SPG\u2019s reliance on variable-rate debt with interest rate floors could lead to increased interest costs and constrained liquidity if market rates rise, affecting its ability to fund future capital needs."

As a result of the redemption, we now hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe. We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion, with a current portion of $4.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans and the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2022, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $292.4 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities increased $938.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, include:\n\n- An increase in our segment operating profit of $851.9 million, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related costs, primarily associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition;\n- An increase in unearned revenue due to advance payments from a customer;\n- An increase in non-cash operating activities, including an increase of approximately $143.6 million in straight-line revenue;\n- An increase in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in prepaid and other assets;\n- An increase of approximately $78.9 million in cash paid for taxes; and\n- An increase of approximately $28.9 million in cash paid for interest.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nOur significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 are highlighted below:\n\n- We spent approximately $19.3 billion for acquisitions, primarily related to the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as asset acquisitions in the United States, Bangladesh, Chile, France, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru and Poland.\n- We spent $1.4 billion for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions):\n\n",

AMT\u2019s FFO growth of 35% from 2020 to 2021 indicates strong capital deployment and operational efficiency, while SPG emphasizes maintaining investment-grade credit ratings and accessing diverse capital sources to support growth.

We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward  criteria.  We  selectively  develop  new  properties  in  markets  we  believe  are  not  adequately  served  by existing retail outlet properties.\n\nWe routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international  strategy  includes  partnering  with  established  real  estate  companies  and  financing  international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.\n\nTo support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:\n\n- provide the capital necessary to fund growth,\n- maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and\n- manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.\n\nWe  consider  FFO,  net  operating  income,  or  NOI,  and  portfolio  NOI  to  be  key  measures  of  operating performance that  are  not  specifically  defined  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines are being administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and  other  authorities,  including  where  we  own  or  hold  interests  in  properties,  have  imposed  at  times  measures intended  to  control  its  spread,  including  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement,  group  gatherings  and  business operations  such  as  travel  bans,  border  closings,  business  closures,  quarantines,  stay-at-home,  shelter-in-place orders, capacity limitations and social distancing measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these periodic measures, the Company has experienced material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to  changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties and investments.  Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter.\n\nAs we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended  to  prevent  its  spread  on  our  business,  our  primary  focus  has  been  on  the  health  and  safety  of  our employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve.  In the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the  property  closures,  we  implemented  a  series  of  actions  to  reduce  costs  and  increase  liquidity  in  light  of  the economic impacts of the pandemic, including:\n\n- significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending,\n- significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend,\n- implemented  a  temporary  furlough  of  certain  corporate  and  field  employees  due  to  the  closure  of  the Company's U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and\n- suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects.",

      "answer": "AMT depreciates its data centers up to 40 years, while SPG depreciates its premium outlets constructed in the same period (2004) up to 20 years on average, based on the pattern observed across multiple 2004-built outlets. This results in a 20-year difference in depreciation periods between the two companies for similar-aged assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT discloses that its 27 data centers are depreciated up to 40 years.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG discloses that multiple premium outlets constructed in 2004 have depreciation periods averaging approximately 20 years (based on consistent '2004' construction dates and depreciation patterns across multiple properties).",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare the maximum depreciation life for AMT's data centers (40 years) to the average depreciation life for SPG's 2004-built premium outlets (approximately 20 years), revealing a 20-year difference in asset depreciation schedules despite similar construction dates."

      "question": "How does the differing dependence on occupancy rates between American Tower Corporation (AMT) and Simon Property Group (SPG) influence their respective strategies for increasing revenue in response to market dynamics?",
      "answer": "American Tower Corporation (AMT) actively seeks to increase occupancy rates on its existing communications sites to boost returns, citing that the majority of towers have available capacity for additional tenants and that most can be upgraded with modest investment. This strategy aligns with their capital expenditure and acquisition plans, where they target underutilized properties to enhance tenancy and drive growth. In contrast, Simon Property Group (SPG) faces occupancy risks due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail operations, which has reduced tenant willingness to enter leases and weakened consumer foot traffic. SPG's occupancy rates are therefore more vulnerable to external factors like public health crises and the rise of e-commerce, which directly threaten their ability to renew leases or re-lease space. As a result, AMT's approach to occupancy is proactive and expansion-focused, while SPG's is reactive and risk-mitigated, highlighting how the same financial metric (occupancy rate) plays divergent roles in shaping corporate strategy based on sector-specific challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT aims to increase occupancy of existing communications sites to support global connectivity and drive returns, noting that most towers have available capacity and can be upgraded with modest investment.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMT's capital allocation strategy includes pursuing acquisitions of under-tenanted properties with the goal of increasing tenancy levels and returns.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - SPG's occupancy rates are negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer foot traffic, tenant financial instability, and increased e-commerce adoption.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - While both companies are real estate entities dependent on occupancy rates, AMT leverages occupancy as a growth driver through infrastructure expansion, whereas SPG faces occupancy as a risk factor influenced by external economic and health-related disruptions. This creates fundamentally different strategic responses to the same financial metric."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4G network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.\n- Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers' needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program and acquisitions. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future.\n- Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n- Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2021, had $6.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\n\n## Capital Allocation Strategy\n\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies.\n\n- Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions.\n- Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others.\n- Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs.",

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and other authorities, including where we own or hold interests in properties, have  imposed  measures  intended  to  control  its  spread,  including  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement,  group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-athome, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. Governments and other authorities are in varying stages of lifting or modifying some of these measures. However, governments and other authorities have already been forced to, and others may in the future, reinstitute these measures or impose new, more restrictive measures, if the risks,  or  the  tenants'  and  consumers'  perception  of  the  risks,  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic worsen at any time. Although tenants and consumers have been adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, with tenants adding services like curbside pickup, and while consumer risk-tolerance is evolving, such adaptations and evolution may  take  time,  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  retail  will  return  to  pre-pandemic  levels  even  once  the  pandemic subsides.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned or held an interest in 199 income-producing properties in the United States  located  in  37  states  and  Puerto  Rico.  We  also  own  an  80%  noncontrolling  interest  in  TRG,  which  has  an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. Internationally, as of December 31, 2021, we had ownership interests in 33 properties primarily located in Asia, Europe and Canada and have two international outlet properties under development. We have an interest in a European investee that has interests in 11 Designer Outlet properties, as more fully described elsewhere in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2021, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre SA, or Kl\u00e9pierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.\n\nDemand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases. Although the harshest restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19  have  generally  been  lifted  or  reduced,  and  vaccines  are  being  administered  in  the  United  States  and elsewhere, the willingness of customers to visit our properties may be reduced and our tenants' businesses adversely affected,  based  upon  many  factors,  including  local  transmission  rates,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the development,  availability,  distribution,  effectiveness  and  acceptance  of  existing  and  new  vaccines,  and  the effectiveness  and  availability  of  cures  or  treatments.    Further,  demand  could  remain  reduced  due  to  heightened sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of COVID-19 or other associated diseases.  In addition, some of our properties are located at or within a close proximity to tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants' businesses have been, and may be in the future, heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel.\n\nThe continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors, including:\n\n- the financial condition and viability of our tenants, and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full;\n- state, local, federal and industry-initiated tenant relief efforts that may adversely affect landlords, including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent;\n- the increased popularity and utilization of e-commerce;\n- our  ability  to  renew  leases  or  re-lease  available  space  in  our  properties  on  favorable  terms  or  at  all, including as a result of a deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we own properties or due to restrictions intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including any additional government mandated closures of businesses that frustrate our leasing activities;",

      "question": "How did the reopening of properties closed during the 2020 pandemic impact Simon Property Group's (SPG) repairs and maintenance expenses in 2021, and how does this compare to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) treatment of similar operational costs in its property segments?",
      "answer": "Simon Property Group (SPG) reported a $15.5 million increase in repairs and maintenance expenses in 2021, directly attributed to the reopening of properties that had been closed during the 2020 pandemic. This increase was part of broader operational cost increases tied to reopening and lifting restrictions. In contrast, American Tower Corporation (AMT) includes repairs and maintenance as part of its direct operating expenses at the property level, which also includes ground rent, power and fuel costs, and property taxes. AMT notes that these direct operating expenses can increase modestly year-over-year and may be influenced by expansion into new markets or increased presence in existing ones. Therefore, while both companies experience operational cost impacts from property-level maintenance, SPG\u2019s 2021 increase was specifically tied to pandemic-related reopenings, whereas AMT\u2019s approach reflects ongoing operational scaling and market expansion.",

Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.\n\nServices Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ('Adjusted EBITDA'), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ('Nareit FFO') attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations ('Consolidated AFFO') and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.\n\nNareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling",

Comparable lease income increased $452.0 million, or 10.6%.  Total lease income increased primarily due to an increase in variable lease income of $603.8 million primarily related to higher consideration based on tenant sales  and  lower  negative  variable  lease  income  due  to  abatements  granted  in  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by decreases in fixed minimum lease and CAM consideration recorded on a straight-line basis of $169.4 million.\n\nTotal other income increased $65.3 million, primarily due to an increase in lease settlement income of $39.8 million, a $14.9 million gain on the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property, an $11.5 million increase related to Simon Brand Ventures and gift card revenues, a $6.8 million increase from the non-cash dilution gain on a non-retail investment, and a $3.3 million net increase in dividend, interest and other income, partially offset by a $7.8 million  decrease  related  to  higher  land  and  outparcel  sale  activity  in  2020,  and  a  $3.2  million  decrease  related  to business interruption proceeds received in 2020.\n\nProperty  operating  expenses  increased  $66.6  million  primarily  due  to  the  reopening  of  properties  that  had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.\n\nRepairs and maintenance expenses increased $15.5 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts, as previously discussed.\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses increased $15.7 million primarily due to the reopening of properties that had been closed during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of the restrictions intended to prevent its spread and cost reduction efforts.",

We also disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated property resulting in a gain of $3.4 million.\n\nDuring 2020, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. A portion of the gross proceeds on this transaction of $33.4 million was used to partially repay a cross-collateralized mortgage.

Penney, a department store retailer, out of bankruptcy. Our noncontrolling interest in the venture is 41.67% and was acquired for cash consideration of $125.0 million.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, we and a group of co-investors acquired certain assets and liabilities of Forever 21, a retailer  of  apparel  and  accessories,  out  of  bankruptcy.  The  interests  were  acquired  through  two  separate  joint ventures, a licensing venture and an operating venture. Our noncontrolling interest in each of the retail operations venture  and  in  the  licensing  venture  is  37.5%.  Our  aggregate  investment  in  the  ventures  was  $67.6  million.  In connection with the acquisition of our interest, the Forever 21 joint venture recorded a non-cash bargain purchase gain of which our share of $35.0 million pre-tax is included in income from unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.\n\n## Development Activity\n\nWe routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties.  Redevelopment  and  expansion  projects,  including  the  addition  of  anchors,  big  box  tenants,  and restaurants are underway at several properties in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nConstruction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and internationally that are nearing completion.  Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $944 million.  Simon's share of remaining net cash funding required to complete  the  new  development  and  redevelopment  projects  currently  under  construction  is  approximately  $263 million.    We  expect  to  fund  these  capital  projects  with  cash  flows  from  operations.

      "answer": "AMT faces significant leverage from its recent acquisitions, requiring substantial cash flow for debt servicing, limiting flexibility and potentially forcing it to reduce rental rates to retain tenants or raise capital. SPG, on the other hand, faces tenant bankruptcies that restrict its ability to evict or re-lease space quickly, leading to downward pressure on rental rates due to increased tenant bargaining power and the need for lease modifications. Together, both companies experience a mechanism where financial constraints (AMT's debt obligations and SPG's re-leasing risks) and market pressures (tenant financial distress and e-commerce competition) lead to reduced pricing power and property revenue volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMT_10k_2022.pdf - AMT's leverage from the CoreSite and Telxius Acquisitions requires dedicating significant cash flow to debt servicing, limiting funds for capital expenditures and REIT distributions, and potentially forcing rental rate reductions to retain tenants or raise capital.",
        "Step 2: Extract from SPG_10k_2022.pdf - SPG faces tenant bankruptcies that restrict eviction and collection of pre-bankruptcy debts, requiring lease modifications and re-tenanting costs, which increase tenant bargaining power and lead to lower rental rates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG face pressures that reduce their ability to maintain or increase rental rates: AMT due to financial leverage and SPG due to tenant instability. These factors create a shared risk of revenue erosion through different but interconnected mechanisms."

These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions\n\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements.\n\nOur leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition and Telxius Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:\n\n- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions;\n- impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured;\n- limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners' interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\n\nFurther, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as COVID-19, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation.\n\n## Rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\n\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The impact of COVID-19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets, as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve.\n\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\n\nThe agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us.

In  addition,  we  cannot  evict  a  tenant  solely  because  of  its bankruptcy. If a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. If a lease is rejected, the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the  extent  that  funds  are  available  and  only  in  the  same  percentage  as  is  paid  to  all  other  holders  of  unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  In  addition,  we  may  make  lease  modifications  either  pre-  or  post-bankruptcy  for  certain  tenants  undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant. We continually seek to release vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations, may require a substantial redevelopment of its space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-tenanting of its space difficult and costly. Any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties. Future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us.\n\n## We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably,  including  ecommerce.\n\nOur properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other retail properties  such  as  single  user  freestanding  discounters  (Costco,  Walmart  and  Target).  In  addition,  many  of  our tenants are omni-channel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales. Our business currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores, and we could be materially and adversely affected  if  we  are  unsuccessful  in  adapting  our  business  to  evolving  consumer  purchasing  habits.  The  increased popularity  of  digital  and  mobile  technologies  has  accelerated  the  transition  of  a  percentage  of  market  share  from shopping at physical stores to web-based shopping, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread have significantly increased the utilization of e-commerce and may, particularly in certain market segments, accelerate the long-term penetration of pure online retail which has been able to sell non-essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has the temporary closure of our retail properties and the restrictions put in place by state, local and federal officials caused consumers who otherwise would have purchased from retailers at our properties to increase their utilization of pure online retail websites, but consumers whose previous use of online retail was low or non-existent have recently turned to pure online retail as a necessity due to the inability to access our properties and the ability to purchase non-essential goods from these pure online retailers. Although a brick-andmortar  presence  may  have  a  positive  impact  on  retailers'  online  sales,  the  increased  utilization  of  pure  online shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space.\n\n## Vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.\n\nCertain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may continue  to  experience,  and  other  properties  may  commence  experiencing,  such  oversupply  in  the  future. Among other causes, (1) there has been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers, as well as store closures, and (2) there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise, with each of (1) and (2) accelerating as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us.\n\n## We may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants, if at all.\n\nWe may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic. Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms. If we fail  to  identify  and  secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties, our properties may  not  appeal  to  the  communities  they  serve.  If  we  elect  to  pursue  a  'mixed  use'  redevelopment  we  expose ourselves  to  risks  associated  with  each  non-retail  use  (e.g.  office,  residential,  hotel  and  entertainment),  and  the performance of our retail tenants in such",

      "question": "How does the 20% asset value limit on TRSs impact both AMT and SPG in terms of their REIT compliance strategies and international operations?",
      "answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG in how much they can invest in taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are used to conduct non-REIT qualifying activities. For AMT, this limit constrains their ability to expand non-real estate activities and investments in TRSs, particularly those generating income from international operations, which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency controls that further complicate repatriation for REIT distribution requirements. For SPG, the same 20% cap forces them to closely monitor the value of TRS securities to ensure they remain under the threshold, requiring strategic structuring of transactions to maintain REIT compliance and avoid a 100% excise tax on non-arm's-length dealings. Thus, both companies must balance the benefits of using TRSs for operational flexibility against the constraints imposed by the REIT rules tied to TRS ownership.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMT is restricted by the 20% asset value limit on TRSs, which hinders their ability to invest in non-qualifying assets and expand non-real estate activities, especially internationally due to repatriation challenges.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SPG must monitor TRS ownership to stay under the 20% asset value limit and structure transactions on arm\u2019s length terms to avoid a 100% excise tax.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AMT and SPG face the same regulatory constraint (20% TRS asset limit), but each must manage it differently based on their international exposure (AMT) and transaction structuring (SPG) to maintain REIT compliance and avoid penalties."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nCommencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code.\n\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:\n\n- we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and\n- we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.\n\nWe are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT's deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\n\nFurthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\n\n## Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\n\nOur use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of nonqualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.\n\nFurther, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments.\n\nIn addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.\n\n## We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.\n\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4G network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.\n- Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers' needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program and acquisitions. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future.\n- Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n- Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2021, had $6.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\n\n## Capital Allocation Strategy\n\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies.\n\n- Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions.\n- Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others.\n- Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs.",
