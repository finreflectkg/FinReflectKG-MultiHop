      "answer": "American Express focuses on evolving its card value propositions and differentiating its corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions, while also designing innovative financing, banking, and payment solutions for business customers. Mastercard, on the other hand, emphasizes accelerating secular shifts in commercial point-of-sale purchases by offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms, expanding distribution across financial institutions, new geographies, and small businesses, and modernizing invoiced payments by embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows.",

This could materially impact American Express's business and profitability. Similarly, Mastercard notes that if interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting its products or route transactions away from its network, which could reduce transaction volumes. Additionally, if interchange rates are too low, issuers may reduce benefits associated with Mastercard products, making them less desirable to consumers. Both of these challenges\u2014discrimination for American Express and interchange rate pressures for Mastercard\u2014could lead to lower transaction volumes, which in turn would negatively affect both companies' revenues and profitability.",

The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Ex press cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage or attract new Card Members, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, all of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, to the ex tent our products or offers attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage, or if merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards or more greatly engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices, our business could suffer. Ex panding our product and service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our merchant discount rates or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options, Card Member offers and other rewards and benefits, and we may modify or not be able to continue to offer such rewards and benefits in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. In addition, many credit card issuers and certain other companies have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and other benefits and services that are similar to ours and may be more attractive. An inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future, and our ability to do so will depend in part on our ability to attract value from partners. If such ex penses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment, which has included heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards programs. In addition, increased costs as a result of business and economic conditions may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones, and could subject us to heightened legal and regulatory scrutiny. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Moreover, the speed with which information spreads through social media, enhanced technology and other news sources and the ease with which customers transact may amplify the onset and negative effects from such perceptions.\n\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.

Although  we  do  not  earn  revenues  from  interchange,  interchange  rates  can  impact  the  volume  of  transacEons  we  see  on  our  payment  products. If i nterchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepEng our products or route transacEons away from our network.  If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoEng our products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).\n\nGovernments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reducEons through legislaEon, regulaEon and l i Ega Eon.  See  'Bus ines s   -  Government  RegulaEon'  in  Part  I,  Item  1  a nd  Note  21  (Lega l  a nd  Regula tory  Proceedings )  to  the  cons olida ted  fina ncia l  s ta tements i ncl uded in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\n\nIf  i s s ue rs   cannot  collect  or  we  are  required  to  reduce  interchange  rates,  issuers  may  be  less  willing  to  parEcipate  in  our  four-party  payments  system. AlternaEvely, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to consumers to aNempt to recoup a porEon of the costs i ncurred for their services, or seek a fee reducEon from us to decrease the expense of their payment programs (parEcularly if regulaEon has a disproporEonate i mpact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge). These and other impacts could make our products less desirable to consumers, l i mi t our a bi l i ty to i nnova te  or offe r di ffe re nEa te d products , a nd/or ma ke proprieta ry three-pa rty networks  or other forms  of pa yment more a Nra cEve, ulEmately reducing the volume of transactions over our network and our profitability.\n\nWe are devoEng substanEal resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in  regulatory  proceedings,  liEgaEon  and  legislaEve  acEvity. The potenEal outcome of any of these acEviEes could have a more posiEve or negaEve impact on us relaEve to our compeEtors. If we are ulEmately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulEng legislaEon, regulaEon and/or liEgaEon may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operaEons. In addiEon, regulatory proceedings and liEgaEon could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the amount of which could be material.\n\n## Limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\nWe have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdicEons, including the  U.S. and  Canada, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. AuthoriEes in several jurisdicEons have acted to end or limit the applicaEon  of  these  no-surcharge  rules  (or  indicated  interest  in  doing  so).  AddiEonally,  our  no-surcharge  rules  now  permit  U.S.  and  Canadian  merchants  to s urcharge  credit  ca rds   (s ubject  to  certa in  limita Eons ).  If,  over  Eme,  a n  increa s ed  number  of  mercha nts   choos e  to  s urcha rge  a s   permiNed,  this   could  res ult  in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment. These responses could result in a decrease in our overall transacEon volumes, which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\n## Preferential or Protective Government Actions\n\n## Preferential or protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.\n\nGovernments in some countries have acted, or in the future  may  act,  to  provide  resources,  preferenEal  treatment  or  other  protecEon  to  selected  naEonal  or domesEc payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own naEonal provider.  These acEons may displace us from, prevent us  from  entering  into,  or  s ubs ta nEa lly  res trict  us   from  pa rEcipa Eng  in,  pa rEcula r  geogra phies ,  a nd  ma y  prevent  us   from  compeEng  effecEvely  a ga ins t  thos e providers. For example:\n\n- Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory requirements that mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely i n tha t country or by only domestic companies.\n- Some jurisdicEons have implemented, or are considering implemenEng, requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications as well as increased compliance burdens and other costs.\n- GeopoliEcal  events  and  any  resulEng  OFAC  sancEons,  adverse  trade  policies,  enforcement  of  U.S.  laws  related  to  countering  the  financing  of  terrorism, economic sancEons and anE-corrupEon, or other types of government acEons could lead affected or other jurisdicEons to take acEons in response that could adversely affect our business.

The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Ex press cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage or attract new Card Members, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, all of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, to the ex tent our products or offers attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage, or if merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards or more greatly engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices, our business could suffer. Ex panding our product and service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our merchant discount rates or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options, Card Member offers and other rewards and benefits, and we may modify or not be able to continue to offer such rewards and benefits in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. In addition, many credit card issuers and certain other companies have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and other benefits and services that are similar to ours and may be more attractive. An inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future, and our ability to do so will depend in part on our ability to attract value from partners. If such ex penses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment, which has included heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards programs. In addition, increased costs as a result of business and economic conditions may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones, and could subject us to heightened legal and regulatory scrutiny. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Moreover, the speed with which information spreads through social media, enhanced technology and other news sources and the ease with which customers transact may amplify the onset and negative effects from such perceptions.\n\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.

These  threats  also  may  be  further  enhanced  in  frequency  or effectiveness through threat actors' use of AI.\n\nOur operaEons rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidenEal, proprietary, sensiEve and personal informaEon and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our customers and other parEes in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, soVware and networks to conduct their operaEons.

Because  of  our  posiEon  in  the  payments  value  chain,  we  believe  that  we  are  likely  to conEnue to be a target of such threats and aNacks. GeopoliEcal events and resulEng government acEvity could also lead to informaEon security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption.\n\nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact relaEng to cyber-aNacks or other informaEon security breaches.  However, future aNacks or breaches could l e a d to s e curi ty bre a che s  of the networks , s ys tems  (including third-pa rty provider s ys tems ) or devices  tha t our cus tomers  us e to a cces s  our products  a nd s ervices , which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destrucEon of confidenEal, proprietary, sensiEve and personal  informaEon  (including  account  data  informaEon)  or  data  security  compromises.  Such  aNacks  or  breaches  could  also  cause  service  interrupEons, malfuncEons  or  other  failures  in  the  physical  infrastructure,  networks  or  operaEons  systems  that  support  our  business  and  customers  (such  as  the  lack  of availability of our services), as well as the operaEons of our customers or other third parEes.  In addiEon, they could lead to damage to our reputaEon with our customers,  other  stakeholders  and  the  broader  payments  ecosystem,  addiEonal  costs  to  us  (such  as  repairing  systems,  adding  new  personnel  or  protecEon technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalEes, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdicEons in which we are deemed criEcal naEonal infrastructure.  If such aNacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded.\n\nIn  a ddiEon to informaEon security risks for our systems and networks, we also rouEnely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transacEon data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputaEonal damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputaEon or brands resulEng from an account data breach of our systems and networks or those of our customers, merchants and other third parEes could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addiEon to reputaEonal concerns, the cumulaEve impact of mulEple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulEng from s uch events by, among other things, making it more difficult to idenEfy consumers.  Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulEng from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could sEll face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operaEons.  While we offer security soluEons that are designed to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyberaNacks,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  security  soluEons  will  perform  as  expected  or  address  all  possible  security  threats.  Real  or  perceived  defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security solutions could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions and our business and may s ubject us to liEgaEon, governmental audits and invesEgaEon or other liabiliEes.  Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transacEon volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.\n\nIn  a ddiEon,  companies  have  generally  experienced  in  recent  years  an  increase  in  fraudulent  acEvity  and  cyber-aNacks.  Criminals  are  using  increasingly s ophisEcated  methods  to  capture  consumer  personal  informaEon  to  engage  in  illegal  acEviEes  such  as  counterfeiEng  or  other  fraud  and  may  see  their effecEveness enhanced by the use of AI.  As outsourcing and specializaEon become common in the payments industry, there are more third parEes involved in processing transacEons using our payment products. We conEnue to take measures to make card and digital payments more secure. However, increased fraud l e ve l s   a nd  cybe r-a Na cks   i nvol vi ng  our  products ,  s e rvi ce s   a nd/or  ne twork,  or  mi s conduct  or  negl i gence  by  thi rd  pa rEes   s wi tchi ng  or  otherwis e  s ervi ci ng  our products  and  services  could  damage  our  reputaEon  and  reduce  the  use  and  acceptance  of  our  products  and  services  and/or  increase  our  compliance  costs. Further, such occurrences have resulted in and could further result in legislaEve or regulatory intervenEon, which could lead to enhanced security requirements and liabilities. See 'Risk Factors - Privacy, Data ProtecEon, AI and InformaEon Security Compliance' in this Part I, Item 1A for more detail concerning related legal ri s ks  a nd obl i ga ti ons .\n\nDespite various miEgaEon efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we, or third parEes with which we work, will not suffer material breaches and resulEng losses in the future.

Both companies face risks to transaction volumes, but from different angles: American Express from external merchant behavior and brand perception issues, and Mastercard from regulatory-driven user friction in transactions.",

        "Step 1: From AXP_10k_2024.pdf, American Express identifies that surcharging and discrimination by merchants could materially reduce transaction volumes and card usage, which are central to their revenue growth.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to declining transaction volumes, but through different mechanisms: AXP due to merchant surcharging and brand-related usage suppression, and MA due to regulatory friction in customer authentication. The combined effect could represent a broader industry challenge where both players experience downward pressure on a shared key metric: transaction volumes."

      "question": "How do the specific impacts of declining business spending on American Express's loan securitization plans and Mastercard's cross-border transaction revenues combine to affect their respective financial performances?",
      "answer": "The decline in business spending negatively affects American Express's ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, which is a key part of their funding plan. This could lead to funding challenges inconsistent with current expectations. Similarly, reduced business spending impacts Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes, which are a significant source of revenue through cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees. Both companies are thus exposed to financial performance risks due to lower business spending, with American Express facing potential liquidity constraints and Mastercard experiencing reduced fee income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - American Express's funding plan depends on the ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, which could be inconsistent with current expectations due to changes in business spending.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Mastercard generates significant revenue from cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees, which are sensitive to reductions in business and consumer spending.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to the same macroeconomic factor (business spending), but through different mechanisms: American Express via loan securitization and funding risk, and Mastercard via transaction fee revenue risk. Declining business spending negatively impacts both, but in distinct financial dimensions."

We switch substanEally all cross-border transacEons using  Mastercard,  Maestro and  Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount  of  revenue  from  cross-border  volume  fees  and  fees  related  to  switched  transacEons. Revenue  from  switching  cross-border  and  currency  conversion tra ns a cEons  for our customers fluctuates with the levels and desEnaEons of cross-border travel and our customers' need for transacEons to be converted into their  base  currency.

These include or have included:\n\n- Global pandemics (and related post-pandemic global economic impacts) and potenEal separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics)\n- Current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business\n- The threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change)\n\nThe impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ulEmately decrease cross-border acEvity.  AddiEonally, any regulaEon of i nterregional interchange fees could also negaEvely impact our cross-border acEvity (for example, the targets announced by the  G20  Financial  Stability  Board related to cross-border payments).

As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $87 million and $589 million, respectively, related to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries recognized during fiscal 2018.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the  amount  of  unsettled  Visa  payment  transactions  at  any  point  in  time.  We  maintain  and  regularly  review  global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit  standards  are  not  met.  See Note  1-Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies and Note  12-Settlement Guarantee  Management to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04,  which  provides  optional  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  U.S.  GAAP  to  contracts,  hedging relationships  and  other  transactions  that  reference  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  or  another  reference  rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the  effect  ASU  2020-04  and  its  subsequent  amendment  will  have  on  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in  the  United  States  of  America  which  require  us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions  and  estimates  that  affect  the amounts reported. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to  our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of  this  report.  We  have  established  policies  and control  procedures  which  seek  to  ensure  that  estimates  and  assumptions  are  appropriately  governed  and  applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n\nWe believe  that  the  following  accounting  estimates  are  the  most  critical  to  fully  understand  and  evaluate  our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.",

      "question": "How did Schwab's acquisition of USAA-IMCO, which added over one million brokerage accounts and $80 billion in client assets, influence its ability to compete for and retain a growing client base, and how does this compare to Visa's dependency on its existing client and merchant base for revenue growth as stated in its 2022 10-K?",
      "answer": "Schwab's acquisition of USAA-IMCO added over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with $80 billion in client assets, directly expanding its client base and enhancing its competitive position through scale and a long-term referral agreement with USAA. This strategic move strengthened Schwab\u2019s ability to grow its client base organically through exclusive access to USAA members. In contrast, Visa explicitly states that its revenues and profits are heavily dependent on its existing client and merchant base, which is costly to win, retain, and develop. Visa faces risks from client concentration, as a significant portion of its revenue comes from a few large clients, and the loss of any could harm its business. Additionally, Visa must continuously offer incentives to retain clients and merchants, which pressures profitability. Therefore, while Schwab expanded its client base through a targeted acquisition, Visa's growth and profitability are constrained by its reliance on maintaining and incentivizing its current client relationships.",

The goodwill assigned to the Investor Services and Advisor Services segments were $6.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income include total net revenues and net income attributable to the TD Ameritrade acquisition of $1.7 billion and $583 million, respectively, for the period October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\n\nIn connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition, the Company incurred various professional fees and other costs such as advisory, legal, and accounting fees. In total, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $56 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are primarily included in professional services on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## USAA-IMCO\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company's operations through the addition of over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA's members through the long-term referral agreement.\n\nThe Company accounted for the USAA-IMCO acquisition as a business combination under GAAP and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we made a $43 million post-closing adjustment to the purchase price resulting in reductions of $9 million and $34 million to our initial estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired and goodwill, respectively. The Company finalized the valuation of assets and liabilities during the three months ended December 31, 2020, resulting in no additional adjustments to the estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.",

We may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, or agree to business arrangements that  may  be  less  protective  of  Visa's  proprietary  technology  and  interests  in  order  to  compete  and  we  may  face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth.\n\n## Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain and develop.\n\nOur financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive  services.  While  we  have  certain  contractual  protections,  our  clients,  including  some  of  our  largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. For  more  information,  please  see Note  14-Enterprise-wide  Disclosures  and  Concentration  of  Business to  our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\nIn addition, we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients. In order to stay competitive, we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services.  These  include  up-front  cash  payments,  fee  discounts,  rebates,  credits,  performance-based  incentives, marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants and acquirers to win routing preference in relation to other network options or forms of payment. Market pressures on pricing, incentives, fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways  to  offset  or  absorb  the  financial  impact  of  these  incentives,  fee  discounts  and  rebates,  it  may  harm  our  net revenues and profits.\n\nIn addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.\n\n## Merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business.\n\nWe  rely  in  part  on  merchants  and  their  relationships  with  our  clients  to  maintain  and  expand  the  use  and acceptance of Visa products. Certain merchants and merchant-affiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S., Canada and Europe, to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory intervention, filing lawsuits and in some cases, surcharging or refusing to accept Visa products.

In contrast, Schwab disclosed that it manages litigation expense through the purchase of insurance as part of its operational risk management strategy.

The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.\n\n## Operational Risk\n\nOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company's risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.\n\nSchwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with thirdparty systems, extreme weather, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.\n\nInformation Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm's information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We also maintain policies and procedures, which apply to employees, contractors, and third parties, regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. This includes limiting the number of employees who have access to clients' personal information and internal authentication measures enforced to protect against the unauthorized use of employee credentials. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab's conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on attempted intrusions.\n\nFraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company's and its clients' assets from fraud and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.\n\nSchwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third-party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through internal policies, procedures and controls, and contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third-party performance, and appropriate testing with third-party service providers.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy that aligns with Federal Reserve guidance on Model Risk Management SR11-7 to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.",

In contrast, BAC reported a Net Interest Yield of 2.30% in 2024, down from 2.73% in 2023, indicating a decline in yield. This comparison highlights that AXP's credit business generated a significantly higher interest yield and improved year-over-year, whereas BAC's credit business experienced a lower yield and a year-over-year deterioration.",

      "answer": "AXP reports a Net Interest Yield on Average CardMember Loans of 12.8% for 2024, which is calculated by dividing adjusted net interest income ($10,931 million) by average CardMember loans ($85,264 million). In contrast, BAC defines Net Interest Yield as net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. This indicates that while both companies measure net interest yield, AXP's calculation is specific to its CardMember loan portfolio, whereas BAC's metric encompasses all interest-earning assets, making the two metrics not directly comparable.",

      "question": "How did the changes in net interest yield for AXP and BAC in 2024, influenced by interest rate dynamics and credit risk exposure, affect their respective net interest income growth trajectories?",
      "answer": "AXP reported net interest income of $15.5 billion for 2024, with the potential for this figure to decrease if the rate of interest paid on borrowings increases more than the rate earned on loans, which would reduce net interest yield. This sensitivity to interest rate changes is compounded by credit risk exposure, as rising delinquencies and defaults could further impact profitability and net interest income. In contrast, BAC experienced a decrease in net interest income by $871 million to $56.1 billion in 2024, driven by a 13 basis point decline in net interest yield to 1.95%, primarily due to higher deposit costs. While BAC\u2019s net interest yield decline was partially offset by higher asset yields and Global Markets activity, AXP\u2019s net interest income faces more direct pressure from credit risk factors. This divergence shows that while both companies experienced pressures on net interest yield, BAC\u2019s decline was more directly tied to deposit cost increases, whereas AXP\u2019s trajectory is more sensitive to credit risk and underwriting performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AXP had $15.5 billion in net interest income for 2024 and is exposed to credit risk that could reduce net interest yield and income if delinquencies rise or interest rate spreads narrow.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AXP and BAC experienced pressures on net interest yield, but the drivers differ: AXP\u2019s is more tied to credit risk and customer repayment behavior, while BAC\u2019s is driven by deposit costs and only partially offset by asset yield improvements. This results in different net interest income growth trajectories despite both operating in the same sector and being affected by interest rate changes."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk, principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. G eneral economic factors, such as recession, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer's ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but also by a customer's other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us.\n\nWe rely principally on the customer's creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customer's creditworthiness, including as a result of the current interest rate and economic conditions. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nRising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\n\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance) or changes in customer behavior (such as the increased use of debt settlement companies). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States, as U.S. Card Members were responsible for approximately 88 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\n\nWe had net interest income of approximately $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change. For example, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have raised interest rates in response to heightened inflationary pressures. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see 'Risk Management - Market Risk Management Process' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions. Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For ex ample, in 2023 the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies proposed capital rules that would result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for us and rules that would require us and AENB to issue and/or maintain minimum amounts of eligible long-term debt with specific terms. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on results from a supervisory stress test.\n\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules or supervisory expectations regarding capital and liquidity risk management capabilities and practices may also negatively impact the assessment of us and AENB by federal banking regulators. Additionally, we are subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of becoming a Category III firm, which may further increase if we grow to become a Category II firm.\n\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business.'",

      "question": "How does C's exposure to FX volatility at 13.17% for trading account liabilities compare to PYPL's risk from FX fluctuations in its international operations, and what does this imply about their relative sensitivity to foreign exchange movements?",
      "answer": "C has a modeled FX volatility input of 13.17% for its trading account liabilities, indicating a moderate sensitivity to foreign exchange movements in this category. PYPL, on the other hand, explicitly calls out FX fluctuations as a key risk factor for its international operations, noting that such movements could significantly impact its business due to the global nature of its revenue base. While C quantifies its FX exposure in trading liabilities, PYPL emphasizes the operational and financial risks without providing a specific quantitative measure, suggesting that PYPL's business model is more broadly exposed to FX volatility through its international operations rather than through specific financial instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - C's FX volatility input for trading account liabilities is 13.17%.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PYPL identifies FX fluctuations as a significant risk due to its international operations generating a 'significant portion' of net revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - C's FX exposure is specifically modeled and quantified in its trading liabilities, while PYPL's exposure is more operational and broad-based across its international footprint, indicating different mechanisms through which FX volatility affects each company."

At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with  respect  to  one  or  more  strategic  transactions,  any  of  which  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  be  material  to  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, consummating and integrating transaction opportunities. Strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including challenges of obtaining regulatory or other approvals, integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and business cultures; challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets or business areas in which we may have limited or no experience; disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention; inadequate data security, cybersecurity, or operational and information technology resilience; failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets; potential exposure to new or incremental risks associated with acquired businesses and entities, strategic investments or other strategic transactions, including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements, particularly with respect to companies in new or developing businesses or industries; challenges associated with dispositions of business or operations, including disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, the transfer of technology and/or certain intellectual property rights to third-party purchasers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions; failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy  or  for  its  anticipated  benefits  to  materialize;  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  or  other  acquisition-related  intangible  assets;  and  the  potential  for  our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt. Strategic transactions are inherently risky, may not be successful, and may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nStrategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations. The success of our strategic investments may be dependent on controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities that may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and damage our reputation.\n\n## Our international operations subject us to increased risks, which could harm our business.\n\nOur international operations generate a significant portion of our net revenues. Our international operations subject us to significant challenges, uncertainties, and risks, including, but not limited to, local regulatory, licensing, reporting, and legal obligations; costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience, including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences; difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences and in light of varying laws, regulations, and customs; differing employment practices and the existence of works councils; difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; exchange control regulations; profit repatriation restrictions; potential tariffs, sanctions, fines,  or  other  trade  barriers  or  restrictions;  import  or  ex port  regulations;  compliance  with  U.S.  and  foreign  anti-bribery,  anti-corruption,  sanctions,  anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations; the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions; and national or regional political, economic, or social instability. In addition, some countries have enacted or are considering data localization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country of origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could significantly increase our operating costs.\n\nOur international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this 'Risk Factors' section. Any violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws, rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, criminal actions, or sanctions against us and, our directors, officers, and employees; prohibit or require us to change our business practices; and damage our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. These risks are inherent in our international operations, may increase our costs of doing business internationally, and could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n## Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.\n\nAdverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, ex treme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fix ed",

Other also includes:\n\n- unallocated corporate revenue and expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the Transaction;\n- offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications;\n- residual tax  ex pense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax  rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments; and\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "question": "What was the combined impact of the FDIC's general assessment rate increase and the special assessment related to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank on the operating expenses of both Bank of America and Charles Schwab in 2023?",
      "answer": "The FDIC's general assessment rate increase of 2 basis points and the special assessment related to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank both contributed to increased operating expenses for Bank of America and Charles Schwab in 2023. Bank of America faced higher deposit insurance assessments as part of industry-wide increases, which the FDIC indicated would be maintained for the foreseeable future. Charles Schwab specifically recorded a special FDIC assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with higher deposit insurance assessments, which contributed to increased regulatory fees and assessments in both its Investor Services and Advisor Services segments. While exact figures for Bank of America\u2019s increase are not quantified in the excerpt, Charles Schwab\u2019s special assessment and ongoing higher assessment rates directly impacted its operating expenses in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Bank of America was subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance assessments as part of a restoration plan that included a 2 basis point rate increase across the industry, effective in October 2022, and the FDIC could impose special assessments, such as the one related to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Charles Schwab recorded a special FDIC assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023, along with higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments, which contributed to increased regulatory fees and assessments in both its Investor Services and Advisor Services segments.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experienced increased operating expenses in 2023 due to the FDIC's general assessment rate increase and the special assessment tied to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, although Charles Schwab quantifies the impact while Bank of America does not."

The Corporation's policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying  reasonable  expenses  of  administration.  The  Corporation's  investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio  of  assets  to  liab ilities.  Th e  stra tegy  a ttemp ts  to  maximize  th e  investment return  on  assets  at  a  level  of  risk  d eemed   appropriate  b y  th e  Corp oration  wh ile complying  with  ERISA  and  any  applicable  regulations  and  laws.  The  investment strategy  utilizes  asset  allocation  as  a  principal  d eterminant  for  establish ing  th e risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile  of  th e  a ssets.  A n  a d d itiona l  a sp ect  of  th e  investm ent  stra tegy  used   to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures.\n\nThe  assets  of  the  Non-U.S.  Pension  Plans  are  primarily  attributable  to  a  U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan's assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The selected asset allocation  strategy  is  designed  to  achieve  a  higher  return  than  the  lowest  risk strategy.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility  and correlations,  current  market  conditions,  anticipated  future  asset  allocations,  the funds' past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption  is  determined  using  the  calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption  represents  a  long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan's obligations.\n\nThe target allocations for 2025 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below . Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $386 million (2.19 percent of total plan assets)  and  $299  million  (1.69  percent  of  total  plan  assets)  at  December  3 1, 2024, and 2023.\n\n## 2025 Target Allocation\n\n",

In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses.\n\nInsurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See '- Regulation - State Insurance Regulation - Reserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis.'\n\n## Underwriting and Pricing\n\nWe use a variety  of  underwriting  and  pricing  management  controls.  Our  G lobal  Risk  Management  department  develops  product  pricing  standards  and  oversees underwriting practices in MetLife's insurance businesses. We also regularly conduct experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, impose formal new product approval processes, periodically update product profitability studies, and use reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See '- Reinsurance Activity.'\n\n## Underwriting\n\nOur underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.\n\nInsurance underwriters consider an applicant's medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. G enerally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.\n\nWe periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\n\nWe use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies that we intend to be competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality  sales,  and  to  serve  our  customers'  needs  while  supporting  our  financial  strength  and  business  objectives.  We  aim  to  ensure  that  underwriting  risk  levels  are appropriately reflected in our product pricing.\n\nWe continually review our underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.\n\n## Pricing\n\nProduct pricing reflects our globally consistent standards. Regional product and finance teams price all of our insurance business with oversight from G lobal Risk Management. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, longevity, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results.\n\nOur pricing of certain products may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. For prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses.  For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on prior years' experience.\n\nWe continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.",

In contrast, MetLife excludes most components of AOCI, including unrealized investment gains (losses), future policy benefits discount rate remeasurements, and certain ceded reinsurance-related embedded derivatives from its allocated equity calculation, focusing instead on adjusted common stockholders' equity based on local capital and economic capital requirements.",

        "Step 3: The synthesis reveals that while both companies use the concept of allocated equity, Bank of America includes goodwill and intangibles directly in its calculation, whereas MetLife adjusts equity by removing volatile market-driven components to reflect economic capital."

      "answer": "Bank of America (BAC) incorporates expected prepayments into its estimation of expected credit losses (ECL) for consumer real estate loans by using quantitative modeling methodologies that consider refreshed loan-to-value (LTV), borrower credit score, months since origination, and geography, all adjusted for economic outlook including unemployment and real estate prices. In contrast, MetLife (MET) pools mortgage loans with similar risk characteristics and adjusts for expected prepayments and any extensions over the contractual term of the loans, while also factoring in past events and forecasted economic conditions. BAC applies these prepayment adjustments at a more granular, loan-level segmentation across consumer, credit card, and commercial portfolios, whereas MET applies the adjustments at the portfolio segment level (commercial, agricultural, residential) and evaluates individually impaired loans based on collateral value.",

          "chunk_text": "in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies  consumer  loans  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past  due  and  reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following three  portfolio  segments  and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo  estimate  ECL  for  consumer  loans  secured  by  residential  real  estate,  the Corporation  estimates  the  number  of  loans  that  will  default  over  the  life  of  th e existing  portfolio,  after  factoring  in  estimated  prepayments,  using  quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's  ECL  include  refreshed  loan-to-value  (L TV)  or,  in  the  case  of  a subordinated lien, refreshed combined L TV (CL TV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography , all of which are further broken down by present collection  status  (whether  the  loan  is  current,  delinquent,  in  default,  or  in bankruptcy).  The  estimates  are  based  on  the  Corporation's  historical  experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses  on  the  unpaid  principal  balance  of  loans  insured  by  th e  Fed eral  Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies  noted  above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at  time  of default.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  the  Corporation  bases  the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date  less  costs  to  sell.  Th e  fair  value  of  th e  collateral  securing  th ese  loans  is generally determined using an automated valuation model (A VM) that estimates the value  of  a  property  by  reference  to  market  data  including  sales  of  comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an A VM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or  if  th ese  meth od s  provid e  less  reliab le valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the  Corporation  believes  that  they  are  representative  of  this  portfolio  in  the aggregate.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than 180  days  past  due,  with  the  exception  of  the Corporation's  fully  insured  portfolio,  th e  outstanding  balance  of  loans  th at  is  in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If th e estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance  to  account  for  the  increase  but  not  to  a  level  above  th e  cumulative charge-off amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit  with out  a  d efined   maturity  d ate.  Th e estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and  timing  of  expected  future  payments  (e.g.,  borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that  it  will  take  for  a  receivable balance  to  pay  off.  Th e  ECL  on  th e  future  payments  incorporates  th e  spending behavior  of  a  b orrower  th rough   time  using  key  b orrower-specific  factors  and   th e economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model. F uture draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is  also  determined  using quantitative  methods  supplemented  with  qualitative  analysis.  The  quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, L TV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  ECL  on  commercial  loans  is  forecasted  using  models  that  estimate  credit losses over the loan's contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual  terms  to  forecast  future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments.  For  open-ended  commitments  such  as  revolving  lines  of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and  payment  behavior  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  commitment.  For  loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer  attributes  such  as  L TV  ratio,  net  operating  income  and  debt  service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the  loss  forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of  transition  to  different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions  of expected loss are conditioned  to  the  economic  outlook,  and  the  model  considers  key  economic variables  such  as  unemployment  rate,  gross  domestic  product,  corporate  bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition  to  th e  allowance  for  loan  and   lease  losses,  th e  Corporation  also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves  are  estimated  for  the  unfunded  exposure  using  the  same  models  and methodologies as the funded exposure",

In determining the Company's ACL, management applies significant judgment to estimate expected lifetime credit loss, including: (i) pooling mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considering ex pected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of its mortgage loans adjusted for ex pected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considering past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Each of the Company's commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan portfolio segments are evaluated separately. The ACL is calculated for each mortgage loan portfolio segment based on inputs unique to each loan portfolio segment. On a quarterly basis, mortgage loans within a portfolio segment that share similar risk characteristics, such as internal risk ratings or consumer credit scores, are pooled for calculation of ACL. On an ongoing basis, mortgage loans with dissimilar risk characteristics (i.e., loans with significant declines in credit quality), such as collateral dependent mortgage loans (i.e., when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is reasonably possible or probable), are evaluated individually for credit loss. The ACL for loans evaluated individually are established using the same methodologies for all three portfolio segments. For example, the ACL for a collateral dependent loan is established as the excess of amortized cost over the estimated fair value of the loan's underlying collateral, less selling cost when foreclosure is probable. Accordingly, the change in the estimated fair value of collateral dependent loans, which are evaluated individually for credit loss, is recorded as a change in the ACL which is recorded on a quarterly basis as a charge or credit to earnings in net investment gains (losses).",

      "answer": "$7,165 million (AXP: $3,000 million + BLK: $4,165 million). AXP's net cash from operations increased due to higher net operating liabilities, including book overdrafts, accounts payable to merchants, and Membership Rewards liability. BLK experienced a decrease in net cash from operations compared to prior years, with significant outflows from accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by changes in accrued compensation and other liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AXP reported net cash provided by operating activities of $3,000 million in 2023, driven by higher net operating liabilities including book overdrafts, accounts payable to merchants, and Membership Rewards liability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - BLK reported net cash provided by operating activities of $4,165 million in 2023, with changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $586 million outflow from accounts receivable, $326 million outflow from other assets, and $145 million inflow from accrued compensation.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Combine AXP's $3,000 million and BLK's $4,165 million for a total of $7,165 million. Contrast how changes in operating assets and liabilities affected each company: AXP benefited from increased liabilities, while BLK faced significant outflows from receivables and assets despite some liability-related inflows."

How might AXP's exposure to losses from merchant failures influence the valuation or amortization assumptions of COF's merchant relationship intangible assets, given both companies operate in the financial services sector and rely on stable merchant relationships?",
      "answer": "AXP's $35.3 billion exposure to potential losses from merchant non-delivery indicates a high-risk environment for merchant relationships, where merchant failures could significantly impact financial performance. COF, which records merchant relationships as intangible assets, must evaluate the stability and longevity of those relationships when determining amortization schedules and impairment risks. If the broader risk environment\u2014highlighted by AXP\u2019s exposure\u2014leads to increased merchant failures or instability, COF may be required to shorten the estimated useful lives of its merchant relationship intangibles or recognize impairments, both of which would increase amortization expense and reduce profitability.",

      "answer": "AXP recognizes Card Member Rewards expense in the period when members earn rewards, recording a liability based on expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, particularly for Membership Rewards, while COF records rewards expense as an offset to interchange income when rewards are earned and calculates its liability based on estimated future redemption costs, factoring in historical redemption behavior and program terms. These differences reflect distinct approaches to timing and estimation methodology in recognizing rewards-related costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AXP's filing, we learn that rewards expense is recognized in the period when Card Members earn rewards, with a liability recorded for expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, adjusted over time by enrollment, attrition, and redemption patterns.",
        "Step 2: From COF's filing, we learn that customer rewards expense is generally recorded as an offset to interchange income at the time rewards are earned, and the liability is calculated based on estimated future redemption costs, incorporating historical redemption behavior and current program terms.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both disclosures reveals that while both companies recognize rewards expense upon earning by the customer, AXP records a direct liability tied to points and redemption costs, whereas COF offsets interchange income and uses a forward-looking redemption cost model with behavioral assumptions."

      "question": "AIG and MA both reported 'Transfers In' valued at $1,819 million and $13 million respectively in their 2023 financial disclosures. Considering AIG's total assets of $30,769 million and MA's total plan assets of $449 million, how does the relative magnitude of 'Transfers In' reflect on their respective capital management strategies and potential risks in asset-liability matching?",
      "answer": "AIG's 'Transfers In' of $1,819 million represent approximately 5.9% of its total assets of $30,769 million, indicating a relatively significant movement of assets through transfers. This suggests AIG may be actively managing its investment portfolio, potentially reallocating capital across different asset classes. In contrast, MA's 'Transfers In' of $13 million (comprising $8 million for pension plans and $5 million for other purposes) represent only about 2.9% of its total plan assets of $449 million, indicating a more conservative approach to asset reallocation. The larger relative transfers for AIG could signal higher portfolio turnover and potentially greater exposure to market risk, while MA's smaller transfers suggest more stable asset allocation, possibly aligning with a more risk-averse capital management strategy.",

While SCHW does not disclose a specific dollar figure for its commitments to extend credit, it reveals that it estimates a liability for expected credit losses on these commitments, specifically related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase First Mortgages. This liability is calculated using loss factors and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. In contrast, AIG does not provide a detailed description of a specific liability or credit risk management methodology for its Commitments to Extend Credit in the provided excerpt. Therefore, while both companies report Commitments to Extend Credit, SCHW explicitly accounts for credit risk on these commitments, whereas AIG does not disclose such risk treatment in this context.",

See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\n## Nonaccrual, nonperforming, and impaired loans\n\nFirst Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets.\n\n## Loan charge-offs\n\nThe Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for credit losses and the loan balance. Our charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings, regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure, and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell. The Company's policy for PALs is to charge off any unsecured balances no later than at 90 days past due.\n\n## Equipment, office facilities, and property\n\nEquipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property include certain capitalized costs of acquired or internally developed software. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized when the costs relate to development of approved projects for our internal needs that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project and postproject activities are ex pensed as incurred. Equipment, office facilities, and property (other than land) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n",

Schwab, on the other hand, bases its fair value measurements for interest rate swaps on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Both companies incorporate coupon rates into their valuation models, but Schwab explicitly references the dual-leg structure of interest rate swaps, while AIG focuses on broader market observables like yield curves.",

Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using prices obtained from vendors and/or counterparties. The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\n\n## Fortitude Re funds withheld payable\n\nThe reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to v arious assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\n\n## Other Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\n\n## ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\n\nThe following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\n\n",

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

Schwab's 2024 10-K states that its capital management strategy includes a target common dividend payout of 20% to 30% of net income and reports a consolidated capital ratio of 6.8%. How does Schwab\u2019s reported capital ratio influence its ability to maintain its dividend payout range, and what does this suggest about the relationship between capital ratios and financial flexibility for firms like AIG and Schwab operating under different regulatory capital requirements?",
      "answer": "Schwab\u2019s 2024 consolidated capital ratio of 6.8% indicates a relatively strong capital position, which supports its ability to maintain a dividend payout targeting 20% to 30% of net income. This capital buffer allows Schwab to balance returns to shareholders with maintaining sufficient liquidity, especially in light of potential future needs such as migrating IDA balances onto its balance sheet. For AIG, maintaining sufficient capital is tied to its ability to underwrite insurance and manage risk through entities like National Union and Lexington, which are subject to insurance regulatory capital requirements.

The Company is continuing to accrete capital organically, and will continue to manage its capital as described above. In evaluating returns of excess capital to stockholders, we will consider the amount of bank supplemental funding outstanding, and may choose to utilize the liquidity we would otherwise use for capital returns to repay outstanding bank supplemental funding balances.

      "answer": "Schwab's 2024 10-K states that clients typically increase their utilization of investment cash solutions, such as purchased money market funds and certain fixed income products, when those yields are higher than those of cash sweep features. This implies that in a low interest rate environment, clients are more likely to keep funds in cash sweep features rather than alternative investment vehicles. This behavior could increase Schwab\u2019s cash balances and liquidity, which may contribute to broader market dynamics where capital remains more readily available. In such conditions, AIG's 2024 10-K highlights that low interest rates could lead to increased demand for reinsurance, as insurers seek to manage capital pressures and asset-liability mismatches. This could, in turn, raise reinsurance procurement costs for AIG due to heightened competition for reinsurance capacity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - Schwab notes that clients increase use of investment cash solutions when yields are higher than cash sweep features, implying more cash remains in sweep vehicles in low-rate environments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG states that changes in interest rate levels can lead to increased costs or reduced availability of reinsurance due to market dynamics.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Schwab's client behavior in low-rate environments may increase available capital in the financial system, which can influence reinsurance market conditions. AIG's exposure to reinsurance costs is directly tied to such market fluctuations, creating a multi-hop link through interest rate sensitivity."

In deciding whether to inv est in A IG, y ou should carefully  consider the following risk factors. A ny  of these risk factors could hav e a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect A IG. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity above and beyond a risk's singular impact.\n\n## MARKET CONDITIONS\n\nDeterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets have and may continue to materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nOur businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. Weaknesses in economic conditions, including a recessionary environment, poor capital markets performance, market volatility, volatility in interest rate lev els and inflation hav e in the past led to, and may  in the future lead to, among other consequences, a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity and declines in asset valuations.\n\nKey ways in which we have been, and could be, negatively affected by economic conditions include:\n\n- increased loss payments and loss costs due to inflation;\n- increased challenges to insurance policy terms and conditions, such as standard exclusions;\n- increases in costs associated with third-party reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms;\n- the increased likelihood of, or increased magnitude of, asset impairments caused by market fluctuations, deterioration in collateral values or credit deterioration of borrowers; and\n- reduced premiums.\n\nAdverse economic conditions may result from a variety of factors including domestic and global economic and political developments, including changes in interest rate levels, plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, recessions, social inflation, inflationary or deflationary pressures in developed economies, including the United States, civil unrest, pandemics, geopolitical tensions, changes to international trade and/or tariff policies, foreign investment restrictions, or military action, such as the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia and corresponding sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, or the conflict in Israel and the surrounding areas, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains.\n\nThese and other market, economic, regulatory and political factors, including the effects of inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, domestic and international political tensions, disruption to our business operations in countries exposed to geopolitical risk, natural disasters and the increased costs associated with meeting customer needs in such regions, adverse impacts resulting from changes to international trade and tariff policies, and any potential U.S. government shutdown, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity in many ways, including:\n\n- lower levels of consumer demand for and ability to afford our products and commercial business activities that have decreased and may continue to decrease revenues and profitability and thus impair goodwill, deferred tax assets or other long-term assets;\n- increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability  by  borrowers that could lead to higher defaults on the Company's investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where the Company has higher concentrations of exposure, and widening of credit spreads that could reduce investment asset valuations and increase statutory capital requirements;\n- increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity, increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital markets;\n- the reduction of investment income generated by, or the market value of, our investment portfolio;\n- increased costs related to our direct and third-party support services, labor and financing, increased credit risk and decreased sales as a result of inflationary pressures; and\n- limitations on business activities and increased compliance risks with respect to economic sanctions regulations relating to jurisdictions in which our businesses operate or we have operations.\n\n14\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

Currently, the EVE exposure to rates increasing or decreasing in a similar magnitude shows that there is greater exposure to rates decreasing.\n\n## Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation\n\nConsistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates, under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue, did not have a significant impact on the Company's total net revenues. Our net interest revenue, EVE, and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.\n\nDue to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC's liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&amp;Co, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; and dividend payments on CSC's preferred and common stock. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiary are primarily driven by client activity, including trading and margin lending activities, and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels and other borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\n\nWe employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity sources are also tested periodically and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management periodically.\n\n## Funding Sources\n\nSchwab's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, FHLB borrowings, borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions, issuance of CDs, cash provided by securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets, and other facilities described below.\n\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities. Our clients' bank deposits and brokerage cash balances primarily originate from our 36.5 million active brokerage accounts. More than 80% of our bank deposits qualified for FDIC insurance as of December 31, 2024. Our clients' allocation of cash held on our balance sheet as bank deposits or payables to brokerage clients is sensitive to interest rate levels, with clients typically increasing their utilization of investment cash solutions, such as purchased money market funds and certain fixed income products when those yields are higher than those of cash sweep features.\n\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, Schwab relies on access to ex ternal financing in the normal course of business. Schwab's use of external debt facilities may arise from timing differences between cash flow requirements, such as client cash outflows, cash flows from operations, payments on interest-earning assets, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. Rollover risk is the risk that we will not be able to refinance or payoff borrowings as they mature. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding, and test",

How does the magnitude of AIG's total Securities for Sale compare to the volatility observed in COF's portfolio, and what might this suggest about their respective exposure to fair value fluctuations?",
      "answer": "AIG's total Securities for Sale fair value was $231,733 million as of December 31, 2023, while COF experienced a $907 million increase in its Securities Available for Sale component of AOCI during 2023. AIG's portfolio is significantly larger in scale, being over 255 times greater than the annual volatility observed in COF's portfolio.

COF reported an amortization benefit of $79 million in 2023, stemming from basis adjustments on discontinued hedges, specifically related to cross-currency swaps where the excluded component is recognized in earnings over the life of the swap.

The difference between these amounts is $1,187 million. In terms of net exposure, COF reported a net exposure of $2,322 million after accounting for all collateral, while AIG\u2019s disclosure does not include a net exposure figure but highlights a significant amount of collateral held. This contrast suggests different collateral management strategies or risk exposures in their derivative and repurchase agreements.",

      "answer": "The combined total of AIG's 2023 net liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses ($2,913 million) and Morgan Stanley's 2023 securities-based lending exposure ($74,594 million) is $77,507 million.

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG's 2023 net liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses amount to $2,913 million.",

        "Step 3: Calculate the combined total of AIG's and Morgan Stanley's exposures: $2,913 million + $74,594 million = $77,507 million.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the proportion of the combined exposure relative to Morgan Stanley's total 2023 exposure: ($77,507 million \u00f7 $89,245 million) \u00d7 100 = 86.8%.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - The combined exposure reflects the significant relative size of Morgan Stanley\u2019s securities-based lending compared to AIG\u2019s liabilities, while also showing how AIG\u2019s obligations contribute to the broader financial risk profile when aggregated with Morgan Stanley\u2019s exposure."

In contrast, PYPL's 2024 10-K filing indicates that its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) are included as part of the standard financial statement package and does not disclose any such deconsolidation or reclassification during the year. Therefore, PYPL\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) reflect continuous operations without any material restructuring like AIG\u2019s.",

      "answer": "AIG includes foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency transactions directly in Net realized gains (losses), which affects earnings immediately. In contrast, PayPal uses foreign exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on assets and liabilities, with the gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, thereby reducing but not fully eliminating earnings volatility. This means that AIG's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations is directly reflected in its Net realized gains (losses), while PayPal attempts to mitigate this exposure through hedging strategies that partially offset the effects in a separate income line item.",

The net realized gains and losses are generated primarily from the following sources:\n\n- Sales of available for sale fixed maturity securities, real estate and other alternative investments.\n- Reductions to the amortized cost basis of available for sale fixed maturity securities that have been written down due to our intent to sell them or it being more likely than not that we will be required to sell them.\n- Changes in the allowance for credit losses on bonds available for sale, mortgage and other loans receivable, and loans commitments.\n- Most changes in the fair value of free standing and embedded derivatives, including changes in the non-performance adjustment are included in Net realized gains (losses). However, changes in derivatives designated as hedging instruments when the fair value of the hedged item is not reported in Net realized gains (losses) are excluded from Net realized gains (losses).\n- Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.\n- Changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the Fortitude Re funds withheld assets.\n\n## The following table presents the components of Net realized gains (losses):\n\n",

G ains  and  losses  associated  with  these  instruments  will  remain  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  the  underlying  foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated.\n\nGiven that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional balance sheet foreign currency exposure management program in which we use foreign exchange contracts to help offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates and when transactions occur. While we have processes in place to mitigate these risks, it is impossible to eliminate the total effects of any possible exposure associated with setting foreign exchange rates on our payments platform.\n\n## KEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## KEY METRICS\n\nTPV , number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics ('key metrics') that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\n\n- TPV is  the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n- Number of payment transactions is the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n- An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal's platform or services through such third-party's login credentials, including individuals and entities that utilize Hyperwallet's payout capabilities. A user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product. Accordingly, a user may have more than one active account. The number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the overall scale of our platform, but may not have a direct relationship to our operating results.\n\n34",

      "answer": "A widening of credit spreads impacting AIG's fee income, as noted in AIG's 2023 10-K, could reduce its investment asset valuations and fee income, especially in sectors like real estate where AIG has concentrated exposure. BK, which depends on fee-based business for a 'substantial majority' of its revenue, is directly vulnerable to reductions in market activity and financial market weakness, as stated in its own 10-K. If AIG's market volatility leads to broader declines in investment activity or client sentiment, BK's fee-based revenue would be negatively affected due to reduced investor participation and asset under management. This creates a multi-hop causal chain: AIG\u2019s exposure to credit spread widening \u2192 reduced fee income and asset valuations \u2192 lower market participation and investment flows \u2192 reduced fee-based revenue for BK \u2192 lower profitability and potential liquidity strain for BK.",

      "question": "BK reports that a substantial majority of its revenue is fee-based and vulnerable to market conditions. Given BK's dependence on fee-based revenue, what specific risk factors does BK disclose that could directly threaten its financial condition if fee income were to decline significantly?",
      "answer": "BK discloses several risk factors that could directly threaten its financial condition if fee income were to decline significantly. These include: (1) slowing market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance, and/or negative trends in savings rates or investment preferences could adversely affect its fee-based revenues; (2) weakness and volatility in financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations; and (3) failure to attract, retain, develop, and motivate employees could impair its ability to maintain or grow its fee-based business. These risks highlight how directly tied BK's financial health is to the stability and performance of its fee-based revenue model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, BK explicitly states that 'we are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue' and that this revenue stream is vulnerable to multiple external and internal risks.",
        "Step 2: BK lists specific risks that could negatively impact fee-based revenue, including market activity, financial market weakness, savings trends, and investment preferences.",
        "Step 3: These risks are directly tied to BK\u2019s financial condition and operational performance, making fee income a critical metric for its business stability.",
        "Step 4: Therefore, any significant decline in fee income could trigger material adverse effects on BK\u2019s business and financial condition as outlined in its own disclosures."

For AIG, the Group Retirement segment notes that fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity markets can have a significant impact on 'fee income, advisory and other income.' In response, AIG is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support compliance and self-service functionality, pairing these tools with employee financial advisors to provide enrollment support and financial planning services. Similarly, BK acknowledges that its fee-based revenues are vulnerable to slowing market activity, weak financial markets, and underperformance, which can be exacerbated by interest rate changes. BK mitigates these risks through its risk management framework and investments in operational resilience, including technology infrastructure and cybersecurity measures to ensure uninterrupted service delivery and client trust.",

      "answer": "A sustained equity market downturn would reduce AIG's fee income as variable annuity account values decline, increasing net amount at risk while decreasing rider fees tied to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. This would diminish AIG's ability to offset hedging costs from rebalancing and option expenses. For Blackstone, the same market downturn would reduce fee-based revenue directly tied to market activity levels, investment preferences, and savings trends. Both companies would experience financial pressure, though AIG has partial mitigation through volatility-index-linked rider fees, while Blackstone lacks explicit offset mechanisms in its disclosed risk factors.",

        "Step 1: Extract from AIG evidence - Fee income tied directly to equity market performance through variable annuity account values and net amount at risk, with partial offset from rider fees linked to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index",
        "Step 2: Extract from Blackstone evidence - Fee-based revenue constitutes a substantial majority of revenue, explicitly exposed to slowing market activity, weak financial markets, and investment preference shifts",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A sustained equity market downturn would simultaneously reduce AIG's fee income and increase hedging costs while decreasing Blackstone's primary revenue source, with AIG having partial volatility-linked offsets not present in Blackstone's business model"

      "answer": "Capital One Financial experienced a net zero change in equity from preferred stock transactions in 2021, as issuances of preferred stock added $2,052 million to equity while redemptions subtracted $2,054 million, effectively offsetting each other. In contrast, MetLife explicitly identifies issuances of common and preferred stock as one of its primary sources of liquid assets, indicating a strategic reliance on preferred stock as part of its capital structure to support liquidity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Capital One Financial's 2023 10-K filing, in the equity table for 2021, preferred stock issuances added $2,052 million to equity, while redemptions subtracted $2,054 million, resulting in a net zero change.",
        "Step 2: From MetLife's 2023 10-K filing, under the 'Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets' section, issuances of common and preferred stock are listed as one of the primary sources of liquid assets for MetLife, Inc., indicating a strategic use of preferred stock in its capital structure.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing the two, Capital One Financial's preferred stock transactions in 2021 had no net impact on equity, suggesting a neutral or transitional strategy, while MetLife's disclosures indicate a deliberate and strategic use of preferred stock issuances to support liquidity needs."

      "answer": "MET's tax provision was reduced by $34 million in 2023 and $15 million in 2022 due to tax-exempt income, indicating a larger tax benefit in 2023 compared to the prior year. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes, with tax-exempt income, tax credits, or other tax benefits offsetting revenue in the 'Other' category. This shows that while MET directly reports the dollar impact of tax-exempt income on its tax provision, COF integrates tax-exempt income into its revenue reporting methodology rather than treating it as a direct reduction in tax expense.",

        "Step 1: Extract from MET's 10-K \u2014 MET's tax provision was reduced by $34 million in 2023 and $15 million in 2022 due to tax-exempt income.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize \u2014 MET explicitly shows the tax benefit from tax-exempt income in its provision for taxes, while COF uses tax-equivalent adjustments to reflect tax-exempt income in its revenue reporting, not directly in tax provision."

      "answer": "COF reports its Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, which adjusts for tax-exempt income by applying the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable. This method incorporates the tax benefits of exempt income directly into the yield calculations. In contrast, MET does not adjust its overall results for tax-exempt income but instead explicitly lists it as a separate item in the reconciliation of its tax provision, showing a $34 million benefit in 2022 and a $15 million benefit in 2021. This highlights a difference in financial reporting methodology: COF integrates tax-exempt income into its yield metrics, while MET discloses its impact as a distinct component of its tax expense.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COF's filing, we learn that they report revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, which accounts for tax-exempt income by applying the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and state taxes where applicable.",
        "Step 2: From MET's filing, we observe that MET discloses tax-exempt income as a separate adjustment in its tax provision reconciliation, showing a $34 million benefit in 2022 and a $15 million benefit in 2021.",
        "Step 3: By comparing these two approaches, we identify a contrast in financial reporting: COF integrates the effects of tax-exempt income into its yield calculations, whereas MET explicitly discloses the impact of tax-exempt income as a distinct item in its tax reconciliation."

      "answer": "MET's tax-exempt income reduced its tax provision by an unspecified amount in 2023, as noted in the 'Tax effect of: Tax-exempt income' line item which showed a negative adjustment of $(34) million. This indicates that tax-exempt income lowered MET's overall tax liability. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields to a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes to account for investments that generate tax-exempt income, which is a proactive reporting methodology rather than a retrospective adjustment. Thus, while MET reflects tax-exempt income as a reduction in the tax provision, COF adjusts revenue metrics to reflect the equivalent taxable value of those investments.",

      "question": "Considering the Preferred Stock Amount and Total Stockholders' Equity for both COF and V, how does the presence or absence of Preferred Stock impact the overall capital structure and equity positioning of each company as of their respective fiscal years' end?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2024, COF reports a Preferred Stock Amount of $0 and Total Stockholders' Equity of $60,784 million, indicating that its capital structure does not include preferred stock, with equity entirely composed of common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and treasury stock. In contrast, as of September 30, 2023, V reports a Preferred Stock Amount of $1,698 million and Total Equity of $38,733 million, showing that its capital structure includes a notable portion of preferred stock, alongside common stock, retained income, and other comprehensive income. The absence of preferred stock in COF simplifies its equity structure, while V\u2019s inclusion of preferred stock introduces a hybrid instrument that ranks above common stock but below debt in terms of claim on assets, thereby influencing the overall risk-return profile for investors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COF's financial data, extract the Preferred Stock Amount of $0 and Total Stockholders' Equity of $60,784 million as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: From V's financial data, extract the Preferred Stock Amount of $1,698 million and Total Equity of $38,733 million as of September 30, 2023.",
        "Step 3: Compare the capital structures of both companies, noting that COF does not utilize preferred stock, whereas V does, which affects how equity is distributed among different types of shareholders.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the implications of these differences on investor positioning and risk profile, given that preferred stock typically has priority over common stock in dividend payments and liquidation but lacks voting rights."

      "question": "How do the differences in preferred stock structures between COF and V, as disclosed in their 2024 10-K filings, reflect on their respective impacts on total stockholders' equity and capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "Capital One (COF) reported $0 in preferred stock amount across all years, including 2024, which indicates that preferred stock had no direct impact on its total stockholders' equity of $60,784 million as of December 31, 2024. In contrast, Visa (V) had a preferred stock amount of $2,324 million as of September 30, 2022, which contributed to its total equity structure of $35,581 million. Visa's preferred stock created a liability through dividend payouts and conversion adjustments, reducing its equity base by $755 million over the period (from $3,080 million to $2,324 million). This contrast reflects differing capital structure strategies: COF relied solely on common stock and retained earnings to fund equity, while V utilized preferred stock as part of its capital base, introducing a fixed-income component that directly affected its equity composition and dividend obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COF's preferred stock amount is consistently $0 across all years, including 2024, with total stockholders' equity at $60,784 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - V's preferred stock amount was $2,324 million as of September 30, 2022, contributing to its total equity of $35,581 million.",
        "Step 3: Analyze the impact - COF's equity structure was unaffected by preferred stock dividends or conversions, while V's preferred stock led to a $755 million reduction in value over the year and introduced dividend obligations.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The presence of preferred stock in V's capital structure versus its absence in COF's reflects a strategic divergence in how each company manages its equity and capital obligations."

      "question": "How do the limitations on Citigroup Inc.'s access to subsidiary funds and Wells Fargo's restrictions on affiliate transactions collectively illustrate the regulatory constraints affecting liquidity and capital availability for large financial institutions?",
      "answer": "Citigroup Inc., as a holding company, relies on interest, dividends, and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends and satisfy debt obligations. However, several of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions that limit their ability to provide such payments. These restrictions include local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements tied to Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Similarly, Wells Fargo\u2019s subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring funds or assets to the Parent or its nonbank subsidiaries in excess of 10% of the subsidiary bank\u2019s capital and surplus for any single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates. These limitations, combined with requirements for secured collateral and arm\u2019s-length transaction terms, constrain the ability of both Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo to reallocate capital internally, thereby reducing flexibility in managing liquidity and capital during periods of financial stress or regulatory scrutiny.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Citigroup Inc. relies on interest, dividends, and other payments from its subsidiaries, but these payments are restricted by capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wells Fargo\u2019s subsidiary banks are limited to transferring no more than 10% of their capital and surplus to a single affiliate and 20% in total to all affiliates through 'covered transactions'.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both Citigroup and Wells Fargo face regulatory constraints on internal capital transfers, which limit their ability to access liquidity from subsidiaries and illustrate how systemic regulatory protections reduce financial flexibility for large financial institutions during periods of stress."

The competition for deposits has continued to increase in recent years, including as a result of quantitative tightening by central banks and fixed income alternatives for customer funds.\n\nCiti's costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads. Changes in Citi's credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to Citi, such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or Citi's financial prospects, and can be highly volatile. For additional information on Citi's primary sources of funding, see 'Managing Global RiskLiquidity Risk' below.\n\nCiti's ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater ex tent than expected, or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines, as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis. In such circumstances, Citi's ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets. Additionally, unexpected changes in client needs due to idiosyncratic events or market conditions could result in greater than ex pected drawdowns from off-balance sheet committed facilities. A sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of capital markets activity. In addition, clearing organizations, central banks, clients and financial institutions with which Citi interacts may ex ercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions, which could further impair Citi's liquidity. If Citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity, its businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\n\nLimitations on the payments that Citigroup Inc. receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity. As a holding company, Citigroup Inc. relies on interest, dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations. Several of Citi's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments, including any local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements entered into in connection with Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Citigroup Inc.'s broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses.\n\nA bank holding company is also required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result, the FRB may require Citigroup Inc. to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Citigroup Inc. or its shareholders or creditors, reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations.\n\n## A Ratings Downgrade Could Adversely Impact Citi's Funding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies, such as Fitch Ratings, Moody's Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings, continuously evaluate Citi and certain of its subsidiaries. Their ratings of Citi and its rated subsidiaries' long-term debt and short-term obligations are based on firm-specific factors, including the financial strength of Citi and such subsidiaries, as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of Citi and its subsidiaries, such as the agencies' proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions, potential impact from negative actions on U.S. sovereign ratings and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally.\n\nA ratings downgrade could result from, among other factors, delays or missteps in Citi's transformation efforts, including risk management and internal controls improvements, public statements by Citi's management or regulators, operational risk charges, control failures, substantial failure to meet cost targets, deterioration in Citi's funding structure or liquidity, declines in profitability, significant increases in risk appetite or material reductions in regulatory capitalization levels.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings and outlooks. Ratings downgrades could negatively impact Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as increase credit spreads and the costs of those funds. A ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on Citi and its rated subsidiaries' ability to obtain funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers, which could require Citi and its rated subsidiaries to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements or permit counterparties to terminate certain contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to Citi or are not possible to quantify. Some of Citi's counterparties and clients could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties, of which Citi may or may not be aware. Certain of Citi's corporate customers and trading counterparties, among other clients, could re-evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit the trading of certain market instruments, and limit or withdraw deposits placed with Citi in response to ratings downgrades. Changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only Citi's funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain Citi businesses. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citi's or Citibank's credit ratings, see 'Managing Global Risk-Liquidity RiskPotential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades' below.",

          "chunk_text": "acquiring companies engaged in financial activities without prior FRB approval. If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",

          "chunk_text": "The Com pany recognizes operating right-of-use ('R O U ') assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition based on the present value of future lease paym ents over the lease term  at the com m encem ent date discounted using an increm ental borrowing rate ('IBR '). T he IBR  for individual leases is estim ated considering the C om pany's or a subsidiary's credit rating using various financial m etrics, such as revenue, operating m argin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, perform ing m arket analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) with sim ilar term s of com parable com panies in a sim ilar econom ic environm ent. R O U  assets are tested for im pairm ent when there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset m ay not be recoverable. F ixed lease paym ents m ade over the lease term  are recorded as lease expense on a straight-line basis. Variable lease paym ents based on usage, changes in an index or m arket rate are expensed as incurred.\n\nForeign Exchange . F oreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. M onetary assets and liabilities that are denom inated in foreign currencies are subsequently rem easured into the functional currencies of the C om pany's subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at each statem ent of financial condition date. G ains and losses arising on rem easurem ent are included in general and adm inistration expense on the consolidated statem ents of incom e. R evenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. G ains or losses resulting from  translating foreign currency financial statem ents into U nited States (\"U S\") dollars are included in accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) ('AO C I'), a separate com ponent of stockholders' equity, on the consolidated statem ents of financial condition.\n\nIncome Taxes . D eferred incom e tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to tem porary differences between the financial statem ent carrying am ounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred incom e tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the consolidated statem ents of incom e in the period that includes the enactm ent date.\n\nManagem ent periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred incom e tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable incom e in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If m anagem ent determ ines that it is not m ore likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the am ount expected to be recoverable in the future. T his allowance will result in additional incom e tax expense. F urther, the C om pany records its incom e taxes receivable and payable based upon its estim ated incom e tax position.\n\nEarnings per Share ('EPS') . Basic E P S is calculated by dividing net incom e applicable to com m on shareholders by the weighted-average num ber of shares outstanding during the period. D iluted E P S includes the determ inants of basic E P S and com m on stock equivalents outstanding during the period. D iluted E P S is com puted using the treasury stock m ethod.\n\nBusiness Segments . T he C om pany's m anagem ent directs BlackR ock's operations as one business, the asset m anagem ent business. T he C om pany utilizes a consolidated approach to assess perform ance and allocate resources. As such, the C om pany operates in one business segm ent.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nHierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The C om pany uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation approaches used to m easure fair value. T he fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active m arkets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities m easured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\n## Level 1 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active m arkets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.\n\n\u00b7 Level 1 assets m ay include listed m utual funds, E T F s, listed equities, com m odities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.\n\n## Level 2 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices for sim ilar assets or liabilities in active m arkets; quoted prices for identical or sim ilar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from  pricing services or brokers for which the C om pany can determ ine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as m odels or other valuation m ethodologies.\n\n\u00b7 Level 2 assets m ay include debt securities, loans held within consolidated C LO s, short-term  floating-rate notes, asset-backed securities, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable m arket data.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs:\n\nUnobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which m ay include nonbinding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investm ents for which there is little, if any, m arket activity. T hese inputs require significant m anagem ent judgm ent or estim ation.\n\n\u00b7 Level 3 assets m ay include direct private equity investm ents, including those held within C IP s, investm ents in C LO s and loans held within consolidated C LO s and CIP s.\n\n\u00b7 Level 3 liabilities m ay include borrowings of consolidated C LO s and contingent liabilities related to acquisitions valued using the incom e approach based on unobservable m arket data, or other valuation techniques.\n\nSignificance of Inputs. The C om pany's assessm ent of the significance of a particular input to the fair value m easurem ent in its entirety requires judgm ent and considers factors specific to the financial instrum ent.\n\nValuation Approaches. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determ ined using various valuation approaches as appropriate, including third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and m arket and incom e approaches.\n\nA significant num ber of inputs used to value equity, debt securities, and loans held within C LO s and C IP s are sourced from  third-party pricing vendors. G enerally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active m arkets and as Level 2 for other sim ilar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determ ining the price.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Customer and Other Payables\n\nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $217.15 billion as of December 2024 and $220.71 billion as  of  December  2023,  and  payables  to  brokers,  dealers  and  clearing organizations of $6.11 billion as of December 2024 and $10.02 billion as of  December  2023.  Such  payables  primarily  consist  of  customer  credit balances  related  to  the  firm's  prime  brokerage  activities.  Customer  and other  payables  are  accounted  for  at  cost  plus  accrued  interest,  which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at  fair  value,  they  are  not  included  in  the  firm's  fair  value  hierarchy  in Notes 4 and 5. Had these payables been included in the firm's fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December  2024  and  December  2023.  Interest  on  customer  and  other payables  is  recognized  over  the  life  of  the  transaction  and  included  in interest expense.\n\n## Offsetting Assets and Liabilities\n\nTo  reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements  (collectively,  netting  agreements)  with  counterparties  that permit  it  to  offset  receivables  and  payables  with  such  counterparties. A netting  agreement  is  a  contract  with  a  counterparty  that  permits  net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such  termination  rights, all  transactions  governed  by  the  netting agreement  are  terminated  and  a  net  settlement  amount  is  calculated.  In addition,  the  firm  receives  and  posts  cash  and  securities  collateral  with respect  to  its  derivatives  and  securities  financing  transactions,  subject  to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively,  credit  support  agreements).  An  enforceable  credit  support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right  to  liquidate  the  collateral  and  apply  the  proceeds  to  any  amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm's right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.\n\n140\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nDerivatives  are  reported  on  a  net-by-counterparty  basis  (i.e.,  the  net payable  or  receivable  for  derivative  assets  and  liabilities  for  a  given counterparty)  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  when  a  legal  right  of setoff  exists  under  an  enforceable  netting  agreement.  Resale  agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements)  and  securities  borrowed  and  loaned  transactions  with  the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.\n\nIn  the  consolidated  balance  sheets,  derivatives  are  reported  net  of  cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement.  In the  consolidated  balance  sheets,  resale  and  repurchase  agreements,  and securities  borrowed  and  loaned,  are  not  reported  net  of  the  related  cash and  securities  received  or  posted  as  collateral.  See  Note  11  for  further information  about  collateral  received  and  pledged,  including  rights  to deliver or repledge collateral.  See  Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a  non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included,  net  of  hedges  and  taxes,  in  the  consolidated  statements  of comprehensive income.",

This significant gap reflects their distinct roles and revenue models within the asset management industry. BlackRock operates as a dedicated asset manager with a strong emphasis on ETFs, which are vehicles that attract large-scale inflows driven by client demand for passive and active investment strategies. The $390 billion in ETF net inflows directly contributes to BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), which in turn drives its investment management revenue as a percentage of AUM. In contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment management revenue of $10.596 billion encompasses a broader set of services, including private wealth management and institutional asset management, and is not solely dependent on ETF inflows. This highlights Goldman Sachs\u2019 diversified revenue base, which includes investment banking, market making, and other principal transactions, distinguishing it from BlackRock\u2019s more focused asset management model.",

BlackR ock's E T F  growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth them es in client and product segm ents, including C ore, Strategic, which includes F ixed Incom e, F actors, Sustainable and T hem atic E T F s, and Precision E xposures. BlackR ock views E TFs as a technology that facilitates investing, and E T F s have becom e core to asset m anagem ent. T he C om pany believes that E T F s will continue to be a structural growth area as clients turn to E T F s as the preferred vehicle for investing strategies of all types. BlackR ock has been a leader in expanding the m arket for ETFs by m aking them  m ore accessible and by delivering new asset classes like bonds or cryptocurrency and investm ent strategies like active. Approxim ately a quarter of 2024 E T F net inflows of $390 billion were into products launched in the last five years. Active E T F s delivered $22 billion in net inflows in 2024, while BlackR ock's Bitcoin exchange-traded product ('E T P ') was the largest E T F  launch in history, growing to over $50 billion of AU M  in less than a year. BlackR ock will continue to innovate at the product and portfolio level and accelerate distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated investm ent solutions.\n\nAs the asset m anagem ent landscape shifts globally from  individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackR ock's strategy is focused on creating outcom e-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions. T his includes having a diverse platform  of alpha-seeking active, index and private m arkets products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. D igital wealth tools are an im portant com ponent of BlackR ock's retail strategy, as BlackR ock scales and custom izes m odel portfolios, extends Aladdin W ealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk m anagem ent, powered by Aladdin . BlackR ock has also seen strong m om entum  in outsourcing solutions am ong institutional clients, including the funding of several significant m andates in 2024, and anticipates continued outsourcing opportunities in the future.\n\nBlackR ock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to m anage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. M arket volatility, growing cost pressures, and com plexity in optim izing whole portfolios underscore the need for enterprise operating and risk m anagem ent technology, and should continue to drive dem and for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackR ock continues to evolve and enable clients to further sim plify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. C lients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to m eet their specific needs, and BlackR ock is providing them  with choice and flexibility. T hrough the integration of Aladdin and eFront, clients are able to better m anage and analyze risk across their whole portfolio spanning public and private m arkets. BlackR ock is em powering clients with data and opening Aladdin by creating connectivity with ecosystem  providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platform s, trading system s and others. This connectivity helps clients work in their Aladdin environm ents with a m ore custom ized and seam less end-to-end experience. Investm ents in Aladdin AI copilots, enhancem ents in openness supporting ecosystem  partnerships, and advancing whole portfolio solutions including private m arkets and digital assets are expected to further augm ent the value of using Aladdin. BlackR ock's planned acquisition of P reqin is expected to expand capabilities beyond private m arkets investm ent m anagem ent and technology to data.\n\nAcross BlackR ock, m any clients are focusing on the im pact of sustainability factors on their portfolios. T his shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainabilityrelated factors can affect econom ic growth, asset values, and financial m arkets as a whole. As a fiduciary, BlackR ock is com m itted to providing clients with choice and then executing in accordance with their chosen objectives - for som e clients, this includes investing in sustainable strategies. T he C om pany aim s to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns within the m andates clients choose, underpinned by research, data, and analytics.\n\nBlackR ock's investm ent m anagem ent revenue is prim arily com prised of fees earned as a percentage of AU M  and, in som e cases, perform ance fees, which are norm ally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. N um erous factors, including price m ovem ents in the equity, debt or currency m arkets, or in the price of real assets, com m odities or alternative investm ents in which BlackR ock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackR ock's ability to m aintain strong investm ent perform ance, could im pact BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings.\n\nCentral banks globally have taken actions to reduce or m aintain interest rates, after a rapid rate hiking regim e in 2022 and m uch of 2023, in an effort to m oderate inflation. BlackR ock's business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. C hanges in global interest rates m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M  to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company's base fees, net incom e and operating cash flows. BlackR ock's business m ay also be im pacted by governm ental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that m ay arise as a result of such changes. See P art I, Item  1A, Risk Factors herein for inform ation on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates and governm ental changes on the C om pany's results.\n\nBlackR ock m anages $2.9 trillion in fixed incom e assets, nearly two-thirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liability-m atching purposes. BlackR ock believes it is well positioned for a stabilizing rate environm ent due to the breadth, diversification and investm ent perform ance of its fixed incom e platform  which encom passes active, E T F s and non-E T F index fixed incom e products, and a range of strategies, including unconstrained, high yield, total return and short-duration.\n\nBlackR ock m anages $6.3 trillion of equity assets across m arkets globally. Beta divergence between equity m arkets, where certain m arkets perform  differently than others, m ay lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackR ock AU M  weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackR ock's effective fee rate. D ivergent m arket factors m ay also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AU M  and investm ent advisory and adm inistration fees (collectively 'base fees') and securities lending revenue.\n\nBlackR ock believes its strategy aligns with expected future client dem and and structural growth opportunities in areas including private m arkets, such as infrastructure and private credit; E T F s; whole portfolio solutions including outsourcing and m odels; and integrated public-private m arkets enterprise technology through Aladdin, eF ront and P reqin upon the transaction's closing.\n\nBlackR ock enters 2025 with strong m om entum  across its franchise, including its newly enhanced private m arkets platform . T he C om pany is positioned ahead of m arket opportunities that it believes will drive outsized growth for BlackR ock in the years to com e.",

Company C's Investment Banking segment reported net revenues of $1.4 billion with an expense ratio of 68%, while GS reported net revenues of $1.8 billion with an expense ratio of 72%.

      "answer": "Mastercard's settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days, with no specific average daily exposure disclosed. In contrast, Visa's average daily settlement exposure was $84.3 billion in fiscal 2024. The difference between the two is therefore at least $84.3 billion, based on the figures provided. To manage this risk, Mastercard records the guarantee at its fair value at inception or modification date, while Visa mitigates its exposure by holding collateral, which totaled $7.7 billion as of September 30, 2024.",

In contrast, V reports a maximum daily settlement exposure of $137.4 billion for fiscal 2024 and holds $7.7 billion in total collateral as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate this risk.

PYPL's 2022 10-K emphasizes that rising borrowing costs could limit its financial flexibility by reducing available cash for operations, acquisitions, and share repurchases, while also increasing the risk of covenant breaches and potential acceleration of debt obligations. Both companies face constraints, but PYPL's exposure is more tied to operational flexibility and covenant compliance, whereas BK's is tied to broader systemic and strategic risks.",

          "chunk_text": "We specifically recognize the inherent physical climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, California, where our headquarters is located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, climate-related events more frequently, including drought, water scarcity, heat  waves,  wildfires  and  resultant  air  quality  impacts,  and  power  shutoffs  associated  with  wildfire  prevention.  These  extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition. In addition, current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change (e.g., carbon pricing) and other aspects of ESG (e.g., disclosure requirements) may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations.\n\n## If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.\n\nWe have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, receivables outstanding, and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. As part of our currency hedging activities, we enter  into  transactions  involving  derivative  financial  instruments  with  various  financial  institutions.  Certain  banks  and  financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, and actively manage  this  exposure  to  mitigate  the  associated  risk.  Despite  these  efforts,  we  may  be  exposed  to  the  risk  of  default  by,  or deteriorating  operating  results  or  financial  condition  or  failure  of,  these  counterparty  financial  institutions.  If  one  of  our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited, held in accounts with, or otherwise due from, such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure  of  one  or  more  of  our  counterparties,  we  could  incur  significant  losses,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\n## There are risks associated with our indebtedness.\n\nWe have incurred indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service  such  debt.  Our  outstanding  indebtedness  and  any  additional  indebtedness  we  incur  may  have  significant  consequences, including, without limitation: requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service  our  indebtedness,  thereby  reducing  the  funds  available  for  other  purposes,  including  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions, strategic  investments,  and  share  repurchases;  reducing  our  flexibility  in  planning  for  or  reacting  to  changes  in  our  business, competition pressures and market conditions; and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases, or other general corporate and other purposes.\n\nOur revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants, the lenders would typically have the  right  to  demand  immediate  repayment  of  all  borrowings  thereunder  (subject  in  certain  cases  to  a  grace  or  cure  period). Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of, or default in respect of, our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments, thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\nChanges by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAn increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and foreign jurisdictions, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU Commission, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. Various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - To calculate the net effect on a diversified portfolio equally invested in both companies, sum the two figures: -$250M + $94M = -$156M. Dividing this by 2 (equal investment split) gives a net effect of -$78M per investment segment, or a total net loss of $78 million.",

Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends as well as consumers' financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we consider when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio.\n\nThe table below presents our consumer banking portfolio of loans held for investment by credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We present our auto loan portfolio by Fair Isaac Corporation ('FICO') scores at origination and our retail banking loan portfolio by delinquency status, which includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.\n\n## Table 4.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by Vintage Year\n\n",

      "answer": "Company C reported growth in Retail Banking loans driven by higher mortgage originations and Branded Cards, while Company COF experienced a 7% decrease in Retail Banking loans year-over-year. This indicates divergent strategies in consumer banking, with C capitalizing on higher interest rates to grow mortgage and card portfolios, whereas COF appears to be reducing exposure, possibly to manage credit risk given the decline in allowance for credit losses and delinquency metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Company C experienced growth in Retail Banking loans driven by 'an increase in mortgage loans as a result of lower refinancings due to a higher interest rate environment and higher mortgage originations, as well as Branded Cards due to lower card payment rates and higher card spend volume.'",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Company COF's Retail Banking loans 'decreased 7% year-over-year' despite growth in other consumer banking segments like Auto.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrasting trends in Retail Banking loans between C and COF suggest different strategic approaches: C is expanding in this segment, likely capitalizing on interest rate dynamics, while COF is reducing its exposure, which may be a risk mitigation strategy aligned with its declining allowance for credit losses and improving delinquency rates."

Capital One Financial includes Retail Banking loans within its broader consumer banking loan portfolio, which includes auto and Retail Banking loans collectively, though the exact ratio for Retail Banking alone is not disclosed.

The key indicator we consider when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they measure the creditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency trends are the key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our retail banking loan portfolio.\n\nThe table below presents our consumer banking portfolio of loans held for investment by credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP reported a Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans of 9.2%, while BAC reported a Net Interest Yield of 2.73%. This significant difference reflects AXP's focus on high-yield proprietary card loans, with an average loan value of $15.0 billion, compared to BAC's broader asset base of $535.5 billion in average earning assets. AXP's strategy centers on maximizing yield from a more concentrated loan portfolio, whereas BAC's lower yield aligns with its larger, more diversified earning asset base, which includes a wide range of loans and investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AXP's Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans was 9.2% with an average loan value of $15.0 billion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - BAC's Net Interest Yield was 2.73% with $535.5 billion in average earning assets.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The disparity in Net Interest Yield reflects differing financial strategies: AXP focuses on high-yield card loans, while BAC operates with a larger, more diversified asset base."

      "answer": "The difference in Net Interest Yield between AXP (9.2%) and BAC's Consumer Lending segment (3.66%) in 2023 reflects contrasting financial strategies. AXP focuses on high-yield proprietary card lending, as evidenced by its $15.0 billion in average Card Member loans generating a 9.2% yield, indicating a premium credit business model. In contrast, BAC's Consumer Lending segment, with a much lower 3.66% yield on a significantly larger loan base ($304.561 billion average loans in 2023), suggests a broader, more diversified consumer lending approach with lower per-dollar returns but higher volume. This results in a $7.634 billion effective yield difference ($15.0 billion * 9.2% = $1.38 billion for AXP vs. $304.561 billion * 3.66% = $11.15 billion for BAC, with a $9.77 billion absolute difference in interest income from these segments).",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AXP's Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans in 2023 is 9.2%, based on $15.0 billion in average loans.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare the yields and loan sizes to infer differing financial strategies: AXP focuses on high-yield, high-credit-quality proprietary card lending, while BAC pursues a volume-driven, diversified consumer lending model."

      "answer": "In 2023, AXP experienced a reserve release in its Card Member receivables portfolio due to lower delinquencies and a decrease in receivables outstanding, which directly reduced its credit loss provision. Conversely, BAC had a reserve release in its commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions, which also led to a reduction in its credit loss provision. The directional impact was a decrease in provisions for both companies, but the underlying drivers were distinct: AXP's was delinquency-related, while BAC's was macroeconomic in nature.",

      "answer": "Wells Fargo's Support Agreement restricts its ability to receive dividends from the IHC if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent's board authorizes a bankruptcy filing. This could materially impact Wells Fargo's liquidity and its ability to service debt, pay dividends, or repurchase shares. In contrast, Bank of America's 2024 10-K highlights a structured capital management framework under its 'Capital Management' section, which includes adherence to regulatory capital requirements and stress testing, but does not reference a similar restrictive support agreement impacting capital distributions. This indicates that while both firms operate under regulatory capital constraints, Wells Fargo faces an additional contractual constraint not present at Bank of America, which could lead to divergent capital distribution outcomes under similar stress scenarios.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b (Wells Fargo), extract the details of the Support Agreement, particularly the restrictions on dividend payments if liquidity or capital metrics fall below triggers.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives: While both firms are subject to regulatory capital requirements, Wells Fargo's capital distributions are further constrained by the Support Agreement, which could limit its flexibility in comparison to Bank of America during periods of stress."

          "chunk_text": "the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity  and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability to satisfy  its debts and other obligations, and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the Support A greement were not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support A greement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement.\n\nRecovery Plan . In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the Bank's plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.\n\n## Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions\n\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A  significant source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent's subsidiaries. V arious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent's subsidiary banks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit the Parent's subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Similarly, as part of their supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions. The ability  of the Parent's subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent's subsidiary banks, see\n\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, under the Support Agreement, the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent's board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. A ny such restriction could materially and adversely impact the Parent's liquidity and its ability  to satisfy  its debt and other obligations, as well as its ability  to make dividend payments on its common and preferred stock. See the 'Risk Factors' section of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders for additional information on the Support A greement.\n\nIn addition to these restrictions on the ability  of our subsidiary  banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans describing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends and share repurchases. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions also must comply with various capital requirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as rules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule implementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. banking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated as global systemically important banks (GSIBs). The failure to meet any of these requirements could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability  to make capital distributions.\n\nIn addition, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management triggers. For additional information on regulations or arrangements that may impose capital distribution restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, see the 'Capital M anagement' and 'Risk Factors' sections of the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures the deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.\n\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. In addition, the FDIC may recover by special assessment on member banks losses to the DIF as a result of resolving a failed bank. For additional information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in the 2024 A nnual Report to Shareholders.\n\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors hav e engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in a significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.",

As a financial holding company , the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy  rules  issued  by  the  Federal  Reserve.  The  Corporation's  banking  entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe  Corporation  and  its  primary  banking  entity  affiliate,  BANA,  are  Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The  approach  that  yields  the  lower  ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy , including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  required  to  maintain  a  minimum  supplementary  leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Corporation's insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe following table presents capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 3 1, 2024 and 2023 for the Corporation and BANA.",

If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",

          "chunk_text": "acquiring companies engaged in financial activities without prior FRB approval. If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",

      "answer": "Bank of America exceeds the minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio requirement by 90 basis points (5.9% - 5.0% = 0.9%, and 0.9% \u00d7 100 basis points per percentage point = 90 basis points), which Wells Fargo is also obligated to meet under the enhanced prudential standards for systemically important firms.",

          "chunk_text": "acquiring companies engaged in financial activities without prior FRB approval. If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",

      "answer": "Reduced transaction volumes due to credit market disruptions for Goldman Sachs can indirectly impact Visa's net revenue. Goldman Sachs notes that a lack of credit liquidity reduces transaction volumes and size, particularly in its credit businesses. Visa highlights that interchange reimbursement fees are a key determinant of the overall transaction volumes it processes, and changes to these volumes substantially affect Visa's net revenue. Therefore, if credit market disruptions lead to sustained lower transaction volumes across the financial system, Visa could see a decline in the volume of transactions it processes, directly reducing its net revenue tied to those volumes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Goldman Sachs states that credit market disruptions reduce transaction volumes and size, increasing transaction risk or decreasing profitability in its credit businesses.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Visa explains that interchange reimbursement fees are a major factor in determining the volume of transactions it processes and that changes in transaction volumes substantially affect its net revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Credit market disruptions affecting Goldman Sachs can lower overall transaction volumes in the financial system, which in turn can reduce the number of transactions processed by Visa, thereby negatively impacting Visa\u2019s net revenue."

          "chunk_text": "## Our  businesses  have  been  and  may  in  the  future  be  adversely affected  by  dis ruptions   or  lack  of  liquidity  in  the  credit  markets , including  reduced  access  to  credit  and  higher  costs  of  obtaining credit.\n\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit,  have  in  the  past  adversely  affected  our  ability  to  borrow  on  a secured  and  unsecured  basis  and  may  do  so  in  the  future.  We  fund ourselves  on  an  unsecured  basis  by  primarily  issuing  long-term  debt  and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial  or  other  banking  entities.  We  seek  to  finance  many  of  our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it  harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available  funding  is  limited  or  we  are  forced  to  fund  our  operations  at  a higher  cost,  these  conditions  may  require  us  to  curtail  our  business activities  and  increase  our  cost  of  funding,  both  of  which  could  reduce our  profitability,  particularly  in  our  businesses  that  involve  investing, lending and market making.\n\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions  often  rely  on  access  to  the  secured  and  unsecured  credit markets  to  finance  their  transactions.  A  lack  of  available  credit  or  an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of  our  clients'  mergers  and  acquisitions  transactions,  particularly  large transactions, and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses.\n\nOur  credit  businesses  have  been  and  may  in  the  future  be  negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price  transparency,  increases  price  volatility  and  decreases  transaction volumes and size,  all  of  which  can  increase  transaction  risk  or  decrease the profitability of these businesses.\n\n## Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\n\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings  could  adversely  affect  our  liquidity  and  competitive  position, increase  our  borrowing  costs,  limit  our  access  to  the  capital  markets  or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized  financing  contracts.  Under  these  provisions,  counterparties could  be  permitted  to  terminate  contracts  with  us  or  require  us  to  post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts  could  cause  us  to  sustain  losses  and  impair  our  liquidity  by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.\n\nAs of December 2024, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral  or  termination  payments  related  to  our  net  derivative  liabilities under bilateral  agreements  in  an  aggregate  amount  of  $315  million  in  the event of a one-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $1.20 billion in the  event  of  a  two-notch  downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about  our  credit  ratings,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  -  Risk  Management  Liquidity  Risk  Management  -  Credit  Ratings'  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  this Form 10-K.\n\nOur  cost  of  obtaining  long-term  unsecured  funding  is  directly  related  to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities  that  we  need  to  pay).  Increases  in  our  credit  spreads  can significantly  increase  our  cost  of  this  funding.  Changes  in  credit  spreads are  continuous,  market-driven,  and  subject  at  times  to  unpredictable  and highly  volatile  movements.  Our  credit  spreads  are  also  influenced  by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.",

Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we hav e historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receiv e any rev enue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the rev erse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees  are  a  factor  on  which  we  compete  with  other  payments  prov iders  and  are  therefore  an  important  determinant  of  the  v olume  of  transactions  we process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether  v oluntarily  or  by  mandate,  can  substantially  affect  our  ov erall  payments  v olumes  and  net rev enue.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased gov ernment regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions hav e rev iewed or are rev iewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e  cap  the  maximum  U.S.  debit  interchange  reimbursement  rate  receiv ed  by  large  financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers' and payment networks' ability to adopt network exclusiv ity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business.  In  response  to  merchant  requests,  the  Federal  Reserv e  has  recently  taken  actions  to  rev isit  its  regulations  that  implement  these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserv e published a final rule effectiv ely requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs estimates potential loss from credit exposures using a combination of current and potential exposure metrics, incorporating market movements within a specified confidence level and applying netting and collateral arrangements. They also conduct regular and tailored stress tests to estimate losses under hypothetical severe market or economic events, reviewing these estimates to identify and mitigate risk concentrations. In contrast, Visa estimates potential loss in legal and regulatory matters by assessing the probability and amount of loss based on management's judgment, historical data, legal advice, and specific case details. Visa also adjusts estimates as new information becomes available and uses loss-sharing agreements to reduce liability. While Goldman Sachs uses quantitative financial modeling and market-based stress scenarios, Visa relies more heavily on qualitative legal assessments and contractual mechanisms to manage potential loss.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Goldman Sachs measures credit risk using 'potential exposure' based on market movements within a specified confidence level and conducts stress tests to estimate losses under hypothetical shocks.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE GOLDM AN SACHS GROUP , IN C . AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties  and  on  an  aggregate  basis  to  counterparties  and  their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information  about  our  aggregate  credit  risk  by  product,  internal  credit rating, industry, country and region.\n\n## Risk Measures\n\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of nonpayment  by  a  counterparty  using  current  and  potential  exposure.  For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents  the  amount  presently  owed  to  us  after  taking  into  account applicable  netting  and  collateral  arrangements,  while  potential  exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level.  Potential  exposure  also  takes  into  account  netting  and  collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.\n\n## Stress Tests\n\nWe  conduct  regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to  counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest  rates,  equity  prices).  These  shocks  cover  a  wide  range  of moderate  and  more  extreme  market  movements,  including  shocks  to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event.  In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact  of  the  default  on  our  sovereign  credit  exposures,  changes  to  our credit  exposures  arising  from  potential  market  moves  in  response  to  the default, and  the impact  of credit market  deterioration  on  corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these  events  occurring.  We  also  perform  firmwide  stress  tests.  See 'Overview  and  Structure  of  Risk  Management'  for  information  about firmwide stress tests.\n\nTo  supplement  these  regular  stress  tests,  as  described  above,  we  also conduct  tailored  stress  tests  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  in  response  to  specific events  that  we  deem  significant.  We  also  utilize  these  stress  tests  to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers  and  counterparties  along  with  the  shocks  to  the  risk  factors described  above.  The  parameters  of  these  shocks  vary  based  on  the scenario reflected in each stress test. We  review estimated losses produced  by  the  stress  tests  in  order  to  understand  their  magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and seek to mitigate our exposures, where necessary.\n\n112\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\n## Limits\n\nWe  use  credit  risk  limits  at  various  levels,  as  well  as  underwriting standards  to  manage  the  size  and  nature  of  our  credit  exposures.  Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to  allow  for  regular  monitoring,  review,  escalation  and  management  of credit risk concentrations. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nCredit  Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\n\n## Risk Mitigants\n\nTo  reduce  our  credit  exposures  on  derivatives  and  securities  financing transactions,  we  may  enter  into  netting  agreements  with  counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We  may  also  reduce  credit  risk  with  counterparties  by  entering  into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent  basis  and/or  to  terminate  transactions  if  the  counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive  correlation  between  the  creditworthiness  of  our  counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\n\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of  potential  risk  mitigants.  Risk  mitigants  include  collateral  provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain  lending  commitments,  provisions  in  the  legal  documentation  that allow  us  to  adjust  loan  amounts,  pricing,  structure  and  other  terms  as market  conditions  change.  The  type  and  structure  of  risk  mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\n\nWhen we do not  have  sufficient  visibility  into  a  counterparty's  financial strength  or  when  we  believe  a  counterparty  requires  support  from  its parent, we  may  obtain  third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations.  We  may  also  seek  to  mitigate  our  credit  risk  using  credit derivatives or participation agreements.",

We enter into long-term incentiv e agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for v arious programs  that  prov ide  cash  and  other  incentiv es  designed  to  increase  rev enue  by  growing  payments  v olume,  increasing  Visa  product  acceptance, encouraging merchant acceptance and use of Visa payment serv ices and driv ing innov ation. These incentiv es are primarily accounted for as reductions to net rev enue; howev er, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair v alue can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentiv es are recognized systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These estimates are regularly rev iewed and adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.\n\nAssumptions  and  judgment. Estimation  of  client  incentiv es  relies  on  forecasts  of  payments  and  transaction  v olume,  card  issuance  and  card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners.\n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. If  actual  performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentiv es may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentiv e payments are generally driv en by increased payments and transaction v olume, which driv e our net rev enue. As a result, in the ev ent incentiv e payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to hav e a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. T he cumulativ e impact of a rev ision in estimates is recorded in the period such rev isions become probable and estimable.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\nCritical estimates. We are currently inv olv ed in v arious legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAssumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability  for  such  claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are inherently subjectiv e and based on a number of factors, including management's understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, adv ice of internal and external legal counsel and management's best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes av ailable, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may rev ise our estimates.\n\nWe  have  entered  into  loss  sharing  agreements  that  reduce  our  potential  liability  under  certain  litigation.  Howev er,  our  U.S.  retrospectiv e responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the  U.S. cov ered litigation.  T he plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. cov ered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan only cov ers Visa Europe territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cov er any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter.  See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to  our  consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could hav e material adv erse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nCritical estimates. The determination of our prov ision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of accounting principles and tax laws.",

On January 23, 2024, Visa's common stockholders approved amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation authorizing Visa to implement an exchange offer program that would hav e the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on portions of the Company's class B common stock by allowing holders to exchange a portion of their outstanding shares of class B common stock for shares of freely tradeable class C common stock.  The  certificate  of  incorporation  amendments  automatically  redenominated  all  shares  of  class  B  common  stock  outstanding  at  the amendment date as class  B-1 common stock with no changes to the par value, conversion features, rights or priv ileges. All  references  to  class  B common stock outstanding prior to January 23, 2024 hav e been updated in this report to class B-1 common stock to reflect this redenomination. The amendments also authorized new classes of class B common stock that will only be issuable in connection with an exchange offer where a preceding class of B common stock is tendered in exchange and retired.\n\nThe class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. cov ered litigation has been finally resolv ed. T his transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be conv ertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the certificate of  incorporation)  or  similar  person  or  an  affiliate  of  a  Visa  Member  or  similar  person.  Upon  such  transfer ,  each  share  of  class  B  common  stock  will automatically conv ert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conv ersion rate in effect at the time of such transfer.\n\nAdjustment of the conv ersion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof) resulting in a further corresponding decrease in the conv ersion rate; or (ii) the final resolution of the U.S. cov ered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding increase in the conv ersion rate. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nClass  B-1  common  stock  exchange  offer .  On  May  6,  2024,  Visa  accepted 241  million  shares  of  class  B-1  common  stock  tendered  in  the exchange offer. In exchange, on May 8, 2024, Visa issued approximately 120 million shares of class B-2 common stock and 48 million shares of class C common stock. The class B-1 common shares exchanged have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. The conversion rate adjustments for the class B-2 common stock will hav e double the impact compared to conv ersion rate adjustments for the class B-1 common stock.\n\nClass C common stock. There are no existing transfer restrictions on class C common stock.\n\nPreferred stock. In connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-conv erted basis in regular quarterly cash div idends declared on the Company's class A common stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or non-redeemable, and has preference ov er any class of common stock with respect to the payment of div idends and distribution of the Company's assets in the ev ent of a liquidation or dissolution.\n\nThe series B and C preferred stock is conv ertible upon certain conditions into shares of class A common stock or series A preferred stock. The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become conv ertible in stages based on dev elopments in the VE territory cov ered litigation. T he shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully conv ertible on the 12th anniv ersary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cov er any then-pending claims.  Upon any such conv ersion of the series  B and  C preferred stock (whether by such 12th anniv ersary, or thereafter with respect to claims pending on such anniv ersary), the conv ersion rate would be adjusted downward and the holder would receiv e either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's certificate of incorporation). The conv ersion rates may also be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities.\n\nThe series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equiv alent to the Company's class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically conv ert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter.

W e  regularly evaluate our space capacity in relation to current and projected headcount. We may incur exit costs in the future if we (i) reduce our space capacity or  (ii)  commit  to,  or  occupy,  new  properties  in  locations  in  which  we operate  and  dispose  of  existing  space  that  had  been  held  for  potential growth.

Legal Proceedings\n\nWe  are  involved  in a number  of  judicial, regulatory and  arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of  these  cases  seek  an  indeterminate  amount  of  damages.  We  have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the  aggregate,  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given  the  range  of  litigation  and  investigations  presently  under  way,  our litigation  expenses  may  remain  high.  See  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  -  Use  of Estimates' in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our reasonably possible aggregate loss estimate and judicial, regulatory and legal proceedings.\n\n## Item 4.

      "answer": "AIG explicitly mentions a reconciliation of Return on Common Equity to Adjusted Return on Common Equity, indicating the use of a non-GAAP adjustment process for this metric. In contrast, JPM directly reports a Return on Common Equity of 17% for 2023 without explicitly showing a reconciliation to a non-GAAP adjusted version of this metric. This difference highlights that AIG provides additional context for evaluating this financial metric through non-GAAP adjustments, while JPM does not explicitly disclose such adjustments.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities impact the comparability of the Return on Common Equity (ROCE) between AIG and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in 2023?",
      "answer": "AIG adjusts its Return on Common Equity (ROCE) by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, as well as other fair value fluctuations, to reflect what it considers a more stable measure of underlying profitability. In contrast, JPM reports a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of 17% for 2023 without explicitly adjusting for such unrealized gains and losses, implying that its ROE may be more sensitive to market value changes. Therefore, AIG\u2019s adjusted ROCE may appear more stable compared to JPM\u2019s ROE, which includes the effects of market volatility on its financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG explicitly adjusts its Return on Common Equity (ROCE) by excluding unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and other fair value changes to reflect a more stable profitability metric.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - JPM reports a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of 17% for 2023 without specifying adjustments for unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in how AIG and JPM treat unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities affects the comparability of their ROCE/ROE figures. AIG\u2019s adjusted ROCE removes market volatility, while JPM\u2019s ROE includes it, making AIG\u2019s metric appear more stable and potentially less reflective of current market conditions."

      "question": "How did the rising interest rate environment in 2023 impact AIG's fixed index annuity sales and surrender dynamics, and how does this compare to the increase in annuity-related commissions reported by JPMorgan Chase?",
      "answer": "The rising interest rate environment in 2023 positively impacted AIG's fixed and fixed index annuity sales due to a strong partnership with Blackstone, although it also led to an increase in surrenders as policyholders sought better returns elsewhere. AIG noted that fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and older contracts with higher minimum interest rates contributed to better-than-expected persistency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase reported a $15.1 billion noninterest revenue, which included higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels. This indicates that both companies benefited from the rising rate environment, with AIG experiencing increased annuity sales despite higher surrender risks, and JPM seeing higher annuity-related fee income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG's fixed index annuity sales were positively impacted by the rising interest rate environment and its partnership with Blackstone, although higher interest rates also led to increased surrenders.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - JPMorgan Chase reported higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels, contributing to $15.1 billion in noninterest revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both AIG and JPMorgan Chase experienced positive impacts from the rising interest rate environment in 2023 on their annuity-related business, with AIG seeing increased sales and JPM seeing higher commission revenue."

      "answer": "AIG adjusts loss rates for commercial mortgage loans using a probability of default and loss given default model, incorporating historical data, current conditions, and macroeconomic forecasts such as GDP growth, employment, and interest rates. These adjustments directly affect the allowance for credit losses, which is updated each reporting period and impacts realized losses. Meanwhile, American Express relies on loss rate assumptions beyond the R&S (Review and Scoring) Period to estimate reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans, with auditors evaluating the reasonableness of these assumptions. The use of forward-looking loss rates at both companies shapes their financial reporting by influencing the magnitude of credit loss provisions and the associated audit scrutiny, demonstrating how each firm's approach to loss rate modeling affects financial risk estimation and control testing.",

Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in realized losses. This allowance reflects the risk of loss, even when that risk is remote, that is expected over the remaining contractual life of the loan. The allowance for credit losses considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. We revert to historical information when we determine that we can no longer reliably forecast future economic assumptions.\n\nThe allowances for the commercial mortgage loans are estimated utilizing a probability of default and loss given default model. Loss rate factors are determined based on historical data and adjusted for current and forecasted information. The loss rates are applied based on individual loan attributes and considering such data points as loan-to-value ratios, Fair Isaac Corporation scores, and debt service coverage.\n\nThe estimate of credit losses also reflects management's assumptions on certain macroeconomic factors that include, but are not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment, inflation, housing price index, interest rates and credit spreads.\n\nAccrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses and accrued interest is reversed through interest income once a loan is placed on nonaccrual.\n\nWhen all or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is charged off against the allowance.\n\nWe also have off-balance sheet commitments related to our commercial mortgage loans. The liability for expected credit losses related to these commercial mortgage loan commitments is reported in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When a commitment is funded, we record a loan receivable and reclassify the liability  for ex pected credit losses related to the commitment into loan allowance for expected credit losses. Other changes in the liability for expected credit losses on loan commitments are recorded in Net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n\nThe following table presents a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Mortgage and other loans receivable : (a)(b)\n\n",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management's methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&amp;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&amp;S Period.\n\n## Membership Rewards Liability\n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management's estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management's assumption to evaluate its reasonableness and (iii) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management's estimate.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nNew York, New York\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.",

      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG's purchase of investments in 2024 was $353 million (negative cash flow).",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - American Express's purchase of investments in 2024 was $1,593 million (negative cash flow).",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined 2024 outflow - $353 million (AIG) + $1,593 million (American Express) = $1,946 million total outflow in 2024.",

        "Step 5: Extract from source B - American Express's purchase of investments in 2023 was $1,572 million (negative cash flow).",
        "Step 6: Calculate combined 2023 outflow - $2,070 million (AIG) + $1,572 million (American Express) = $3,642 million total outflow in 2023.",
        "Step 7: Calculate difference - $3,642 million (2023) - $1,946 million (2024) = $1,696 million decrease in outflow from 2023 to 2024."

      "answer": "AIG's potential restitution obligations are tied to its continued equity market exposure to Corebridge, where a decline in Corebridge's stock value could reduce AIG's investment income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. This is due to AIG's election to account for its remaining investment under the fair value option, making it directly sensitive to market fluctuations. In contrast, AXP's mention of restitution is within the context of potential operating expense risks, such as payments resulting from litigation, regulatory reviews, or settlements, which could significantly affect its cost structure and profitability. While both companies face restitution-related risks, AIG's exposure is tied to investment performance and market risk, whereas AXP's is linked to litigation and regulatory outcomes.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AIG's exposure to Corebridge's stock value decline affects investment income due to fair value accounting.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - AXP's restitution risk arises from litigation or regulatory settlements that could increase operating expenses.",
        "Step 3: Contrast - AIG's restitution risk is market-driven through investment exposure, while AXP's is cost-driven through legal and regulatory exposure."

There can be no assurances that the anticipated benefits of our sales of Corebridge stock will be achieved.\n\nSince September of 2022 when we closed on the initial public offering of Corebridge's common stock, we have continued to sell down our interest in Corebridge. On June 9, 2024, we met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. For a detailed discussion of the deconsolidation, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAlthough Corebridge has been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial results, we continue to hold a significant stake in Corebridge's common stock. A t the time of deconsolidation, we elected the fair value option to account for our remaining investment in Corebridge. From that date onward, the fair value change in Corebridge's stock, and dividends received from Corebridge, are recognized in net investment income. A s a result, a decline in the market value of Corebridge common stock may result in a decrease in our investment income and may have a material and adverse effect on our results and financial condition. There can be no assurances given as to the price, transaction costs, or timing of further Corebridge stock sales and, as a result, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of our sales of such stock if there are adverse movements in its market value prior to, or at the time of, such sales.\n\nFurther, the sale of our remaining Corebridge stock involves a number of divestment-related risks, including (i) unanticipated developments that may delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to continue the full divestment, including an economic downturn or unfavorable capital markets conditions; (ii) unforeseen losses, liabilities or asset impairments arising from further dispositions; and (iii) challenges associated with the valuation of Corebridge and the Company as we seek to fully divest our investment in Corebridge.\n\nIn addition, the div estment of Corebridge, or a significant delay in our ability to continue to sell our Corebridge stock, has caused and could continue to cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effects of, many of the other risks discussed herein, including changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\n\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we face significant risk from regulatory and governmental investigations and civil actions, litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We frequently engage in litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and face litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance contracts.\n\nAdditionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of the Company and our subsidiaries in connection with company-specific matters, or industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such reviews, investigations, inquiries or examinations have and could lead to extended delays to, or prohibitions of, such transactions or practices, or develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations to our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\n\nWe, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are also subject to, or may become subject to, a variety of additional types of legal disputes brought by holders of our securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. Certain of these matters may also involve potentially significant risk of loss due to the possibility of significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. M any of these matters are also highly complex and seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. It is therefore inherently  difficult to predict the siz e or scope of potential future losses arising from them, and dev elopments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\n\nFor information regarding certain legal proceedings, see Notes 15 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including governmental responses to such matters, may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nThere is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders on companies' governance, risk oversight, disclosures, plans, policies and practices regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, racial justice and workplace conduct. The requirements, standards and expectations of such stakeholders may also, as a whole, reflect diverging or conflicting values or policy objectives.\n\nGovernmental actions to mitigate climate and other risks related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, or, conversely, to restrict actions companies may take in response to such risks, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Internationally and at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose requirements and guidance related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, which will continue to\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n25",

      "answer": "AIG explicitly states that interest income is not accrued on loans held for sale if payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected, and any cash received on impaired loans is recorded as a reduction of the loan's carrying amount. In contrast, American Express continues to recognize interest income on loans held for sale until they are sold, as reflected in its calculation of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. This reveals that AIG suspends interest accruals on impaired or nonperforming loans held for sale, while AXP continues to accrue interest income on these loans, indicating a difference in their accounting policies regarding the recognition of interest income on loans held for sale.",

        "Step 1: From AIG's 2024 10-K, we learn that interest income is not accrued on loans held for sale if payment of principal and interest is not expected, and cash received on impaired loans reduces the carrying value of the loan.",
        "Step 2: From AXP's 2024 10-K, we learn that interest income is still recognized on loans held for sale until they are sold, as these loans are included in the average Card Member loan base for computing net interest yield.",
        "Step 3: Comparing these disclosures shows that AIG suspends interest accruals on impaired loans held for sale, while AXP continues to accrue interest income on such loans, revealing a divergence in their accounting treatment of interest income for this category of loans."

A ny cash received on impaired loans is generally recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan. A ccrual of interest income is generally resumed when delinquent contractual principal and interest is repaid or when a portion of the delinquent contractual payments are made and the ongoing required contractual payments have been made for an appropriate period. A s of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $252 million and $73 million, respectively, of commercial mortgage loans were placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nAccrued interest is presented separately and is included in A ccrued investment income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A s of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest receivable was $15 million and $21 million, respectively, associated with commercial mortgage loans.\n\nA significant majority of commercial mortgages in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n131",

      "answer": "At BAC, loan originations directly lead to the recognition of MSRs following securitizations or whole-loan sales, which affects the fair value accounting and subsequent changes in the MSR asset due to modeled cash flows and the passage of time. This is reflected in the $324 million unrealized losses related to financial instruments still held at year-end. At PYPL, the forward-flow arrangement for future originations of eligible European buy now, pay later loans over a 24-month period ties future loan originations to a structured sale mechanism, impacting the timing and recognition of receivables and allowances. Both companies use loan originations as a basis for structured financial reporting, but BAC focuses on MSR valuation dynamics while PYPL emphasizes forward-flow receivables sales and allowance adjustments.",

      "answer": "PYPL reported that the growth in U.S. and U.K. revolving loans contributed to an increased provision for credit losses due to credit quality deterioration. At the same time, BAC disclosed that $253 million of its revolving loans were held by borrowers with FICO scores below 620, a segment with historically higher charge-off rates. This combination indicates that both institutions are experiencing growth in riskier revolving loan portfolios, which could lead to higher future charge-offs and increased credit loss provisions across the financial sector.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BAC disclosed that $253 million of its revolving loans were held by borrowers with FICO scores below 620, a high-risk segment.",

      "answer": "PayPal's (PYPL) provision for credit losses in 2023 was primarily attributable to growth in U.K. revolving loans and installment loans in the U.S. and Japan. Bank of America (BAC), on the other hand, analyzes credit quality indicators for its loan portfolio by year of origination, but excludes revolving loans and modified revolving loans from this vintage-based analysis, instead showing them on an aggregate basis as of December 31, 2022. This difference in reporting methodology means that while PYPL isolates U.K. revolving loans as a distinct contributor to credit loss provisions, BAC does not provide such granular breakdowns for revolving loan performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from PYPL evidence - The provision for credit losses in 2023 was primarily due to growth in U.S. and Japan installment loans and U.K. revolving loans.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Bank of America's supplementary leverage exposure by $152.9 billion in 2023 relate to the components of supplementary leverage exposure as disclosed by Morgan Stanley, and what specific factor contributed most to this increase?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a $152.9 billion increase in supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher cash held at central banks. According to Morgan Stanley's 10-K filing, supplementary leverage exposure includes adjusted average assets and other adjustments, particularly for derivatives, repo-style transactions, and off-balance sheet exposures. The dominant factor in BAC's increase was higher central bank cash holdings, which falls under the broader category of on-balance sheet assets that contribute to adjusted average assets \u2014 a core component of supplementary leverage exposure as defined by the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BAC's 10-K, extract the specific increase in supplementary leverage exposure: $152.9 billion, primarily due to higher cash held at central banks.",
        "Step 2: From MS's 10-K, extract the definition and components of supplementary leverage exposure, which includes adjusted average assets and adjustments for derivatives, repo-style transactions, and off-balance sheet exposures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: The increase in BAC's supplementary leverage exposure is directly tied to the 'adjusted average assets' component described by Morgan Stanley, with the primary driver being increased central bank cash holdings."

This indicates that MS, on average, assumes a higher degree of co-movement between its equity instruments and broader market indices compared to BAC\u2019s assumptions for its debt instruments.

The 5.5 percentage point difference suggests that SCHW's capital position relative to its total leverage exposure is significantly stronger than the regulatory minimum, indicating a more conservative capital management strategy or better alignment with FRB expectations for resiliency and loss-absorbing capacity under the Dodd-Frank Act and SLR rules.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the Supplementary Leverage Ratio between Charles Schwab (CSC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in 2023 reflect their respective regulatory capital positioning under enhanced prudential standards for large U.S. financial institutions?",
      "answer": "Charles Schwab (CSC) reported a Supplementary Leverage Ratio of 8.5% in 2023, while Wells Fargo (WFC) also had a Supplementary Leverage Ratio of 8.5%. Despite having the same ratio, the context of their capital structure and regulatory environment differs significantly. Schwab's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital was $31.4 billion with $479.3 billion in Total Leverage Exposure, indicating a relatively strong capital buffer relative to exposure. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, operates under more stringent regulatory scrutiny due to its status as a large BHC subject to enhanced prudential requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve expectations for capital planning and stress testing. The identical Supplementary Leverage Ratios suggest both firms meet the minimum regulatory threshold, but Wells Fargo faces additional constraints on capital distributions and affiliate transactions due to its complex banking structure and historical regulatory focus on risk management and capital adequacy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Charles Schwab's (CSC) Supplementary Leverage Ratio in 2023 was 8.5%, with Total Leverage Exposure of $479.3 billion and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital of $31.4 billion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo is subject to enhanced prudential requirements, including the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, and must comply with Dodd-Frank Act provisions that impose stricter capital, liquidity, and risk management standards.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms have the same Supplementary Leverage Ratio, but Wells Fargo operates under more comprehensive regulatory oversight that includes capital distribution restrictions, affiliate transaction limits, and resolution planning, whereas Schwab's capital structure appears simpler and less burdened by such constraints."

      "answer": "The difference in the percentage of residential real estate loans to total loans between Morgan Stanley (27%) and Charles Schwab (62%) is 35 percentage points. Morgan Stanley reported $87 million in residential real estate loans, with an allowance for credit losses (ACL) of $87 million as of December 31, 2022. Charles Schwab reported $15 million in ACL for residential real estate loans, which accounted for 62% of its total loans in 2024. This indicates that while both firms disclose their loan percentages and ACL, Charles Schwab has a significantly higher concentration in residential real estate loans relative to its total portfolio compared to Morgan Stanley.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Morgan Stanley's 2022 residential real estate loans represent 27% of total loans with an ACL of $87 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Charles Schwab's 2024 residential real estate loans represent 62% of total loans with an ACL of $15 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the percentage difference - 62% (SCHW) minus 27% (MS) equals a 35 percentage-point difference.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - Compare ACL and loan concentration implications for both firms, noting the higher exposure in Charles Schwab despite smaller ACL."

PayPal also refers to 'Reserve build (release)' as the change in allowance for principal receivables, but specifically notes the exclusion of foreign currency remeasurement effects and, in 2020, the impact of adopting CECL accounting standards.

Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.\n\nInterest income - Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.\n\nInterest on loans - Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as nonaccrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.\n\nInterest and dividends on investment securities - Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.\n\nInterest income on deposits with banks and other - Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.\n\nLoyalty coalitions - Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support.\n\nNet card fees - Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.\n\nNet interest yield on average Card Member loans A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation.\n\nNet write-off rate -principal only - Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period.\n\nNet write-off rate -principal, interest and fees - Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.\n\nNetwork volumes - Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. Network volumes are reported as United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nOperating expenses - Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses.\n\nProcessed volumes - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. Processed volume is reported as United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nReserve build (release) - Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.\n\nReturn on average equity - Calculated by dividing the preceding twelve months of net income by one-year monthly average total shareholders' equity.\n\nT&amp;E-related volume - Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.",

      "answer": "American Express recognizes discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and typically enters into fixed-period contracts with large merchants that range from three to seven years, often with auto-renewal features. In contrast, PayPal recognizes transaction revenue at the point of service and does not disclose entering into long-term fixed contracts with large merchants. Instead, PayPal notes that large merchants generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes, implying a more volume-driven and less contractually bound relationship. These differences suggest that American Express relies on longer-term contractual commitments from large merchants, while PayPal\u2019s model appears more transactional and volume-based.",

        "Step 1: From AXP\u2019s 10-K, extract that discount revenue is recognized at the time of transaction and that large merchant contracts are typically for 3\u20137 years with auto-renewal features.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

Number of payment transactions were 19.3 billion and 15.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 25%. TPV was $1.25 trillion and $936 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 33%.\n\nTransaction revenues grew more slowly than TPV and the number of payment transactions in 2021 due primarily to a decline in eBay's marketplace platform TPV where we had historically earned higher rates, lower growth in foreign exchange fees, a higher portion  of TPV generated through Braintree by bill pay partners, large merchants, and other marketplaces which generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes, and an unfavorable impact from hedging. Changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2021.\n\n## Revenues from other value added services\n\nRevenues from other value added services increased by $433 million, or 28%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increases in our revenue share with Synchrony Bank ('Synchrony') and fee revenue from the servicing of loans under the U.S government's Paycheck Protection Program ('PPP') administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ('SBA') and enacted in March 2020 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not own the receivables  associated  with  loans  originated  through  the  PPP. The  fee  revenue  associated  with  the  PPP  loans  in  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 was $157 million, which included revenue recognized upon loan forgiveness and the extinguishment of our servicing obligations for a portion of the outstanding loans. At December 31, 2021, the remaining unearned fee revenue associated with the PPP loans was not material. The growth in revenue from other value added services in the year ended December 31, 2021 was also attributable  to  an  increase  in  interest  and  fee  revenue  on  our  consumer  loans  receivable  portfolio  driven  primarily  by growth in international markets, partially offset by a decline in interest and fee revenue on our merchant loans receivable portfolio due to a decrease in average outstanding loans year-over-year and a decline in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from lower interest rates.\n\nThe  total  gross  consumer  and  merchant  loans  receivable  balance  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $5.3  billion  and $3.6  billion,  respectively,  reflecting  a  year-over-year  increase  of  48%  driven  primarily  by  growth  in  our  consumer  receivable portfolio due to the expansion of our installment credit products, including the entry into new markets.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took both proactive and reactive measures during 2020 to support our merchants and consumers that had loans and interest receivables due to us under our credit product offerings. These measures were intended to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers and included providing payment holidays to grant payment deferrals to certain borrowers for varying periods of time, and amended payment terms through loan modifications in certain cases. Given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration and severity, related global economic conditions and the ultimate impact it may have on the financial condition of our merchants and consumers, the extent of these types of actions and their prospective impact on our interest and fee income is not determinable. In addition, consumers that have outstanding loans and interest  receivable  due  to  Synchrony  may experience similar hardships that result in increased losses recognized by Synchrony, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned from Synchrony in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by Synchrony does not meet a minimum rate of return ('minimum return threshold') in a particular quarter, our revenue share for that period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by Synchrony does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and  in  the  following  quarter,  we  would  be  required  to  make  a  payment  to  Synchrony,  subject  to  certain  limitations.  Through December 31, 2021, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by Synchrony exceeded the minimum return threshold.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2021, 2020, or 2019 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.",

PayPal also recognizes foreign currency conversion fees when charged to customers, reflecting its focus on facilitating global payments and currency exchange as part of its broader digital payments ecosystem.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AXP_10k_2022.pdf, American Express recognizes foreign currency conversion fees 'in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member,' linking these fees directly to transaction activity on its network.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize that both companies recognize foreign currency conversion fees at the point of customer charge, but the context reflects their distinct business models \u2014 American Express as a card network reliant on transaction fees, and PayPal as a digital payments platform offering multi-currency and cross-border transaction services."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached.

We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 426 million active accounts (consisting of 392 million consumer active accounts and 34 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our payments platform on behalf of our customers.\n\nWe offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability  to  transfer  and  withdraw  funds. We  enable  consumers  to  exchange  funds  more  safely  with  merchants  using  a  variety  of funding  sources,  which  may  include  a  bank  account,  a  PayPal  or  Venmo  account  balance,  PayPal  and  Venmo  branded  credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant  access  to  funds  and  payouts. We  also  help  merchants  connect  with  their  customers,  process  exchanges  and  returns,  and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.\n\nWe earn revenues primarily by charging fees for completing payment transactions for our customers and other payment-related services  that  are  typically  based  on  the  volume  of  activity  processed  on  our  payments  platform.  We  generally  do  not  charge customers to fund or draw from their accounts; however, we generate revenue from customers on fees charged for foreign currency conversion, instant transfers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, and to facilitate the purchase and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies.  We  also  earn  revenue  by  providing  other  value  added  services,  which  comprises  revenue  earned through partnerships, interest and fees from our merchant and consumer credit products, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway services, and other services that we provide to our merchants and consumers.",

      "answer": "Both Bank of America (BAC) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) disclose a par value of $0.01 per share for their common stock. This standardized par value ensures consistency in how equity is structured and reported for both companies, as it establishes a baseline nominal value for shares issued, impacting retained earnings and additional paid-in capital calculations. For BAC, this applies to its common stock reserved for future issuances under employee stock plans, while for BK, it applies to its 754,437,391 shares outstanding as of January 31, 2024.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of MetLife's 2023 deposits and Wells Fargo's 2023 deposits, and how does the scale of Wells Fargo's deposit base relative to MetLife's reflect their differing roles in the financial services industry?",
      "answer": "The combined total of deposits for MetLife and Wells Fargo in 2023 is $1.400176 trillion. Wells Fargo's $1.4 trillion deposit base reflects its role as a major banking institution focused on consumer and commercial banking, where deposits are a primary source of funding for loans and other banking activities. In contrast, MetLife's $176 million in deposits are part of its insurance operations, where deposits represent policyholder funds that are typically invested in longer-term assets to support future insurance liabilities. The significant difference in scale underscores the distinct asset-liability management strategies and regulatory frameworks governing banks versus insurance companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MetLife's 2023 deposits are reported as $176 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Wells Fargo's 2023 deposits are reported as $1.4 trillion.",
        "Step 3: Add the two figures to calculate the combined total: $176 million + $1.4 trillion = $1.400176 trillion.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the relative scale and business models: Wells Fargo's massive deposit base supports its banking operations, including lending, while MetLife's much smaller deposit figure aligns with its insurance-focused business model.",
        "Step 5: Consider the regulatory context: The difference in deposit size reflects the distinct regulatory frameworks for banks (focused on short-term liquidity and lending) versus insurers (focused on long-term liability management)."

      "question": "Given JPM's stake in the Commercial Banking Segment and WFC's dependency on regulatory approvals for acquisitions in this segment, how does the $10 billion asset threshold for FRB notice requirements limit WFC's strategic flexibility in expanding its Commercial Banking operations, and how might this affect JPM's position in the same market?",
      "answer": "WFC is required to provide prior notice to the FRB if acquiring a company with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets, which introduces an additional regulatory hurdle for WFC when pursuing acquisitions in the Commercial Banking Segment. This regulatory friction could delay or deter WFC from executing strategic moves in this space. Since JPM has a stake in the Commercial Banking Segment, any limitation on WFC's ability to expand through acquisitions could reduce competitive pressure on JPM, potentially allowing JPM to maintain or grow its market share in this segment without facing aggressive expansion from WFC.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - JPM has a stake in the Commercial Banking Segment, indicating strategic interest and potential competitive positioning in this area.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - WFC must provide prior notice to the FRB if acquiring a company with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets, which introduces regulatory friction.",

      "answer": "COF's total funding sources in 2023 were dominated by consumer deposits, which accounted for 74% ($296,171 million) of its total deposits ($348,413 million). This deposit-heavy structure suggests that COF would need to manage interest rate sensitivity with a strong focus on this core, relatively stable source of funding. In contrast, SCHW explicitly states that its average rate calculation is based on total funding sources, which implies a broader consideration of all liability components, not just deposits. Therefore, COF\u2019s reliance on consumer deposits would likely lead to a more deposit-centric interest rate risk management strategy, while SCHW\u2019s approach would be more diversified across its entire funding base.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - COF\u2019s reliance on a single dominant funding source (consumer deposits) would shape its interest rate sensitivity approach differently than SCHW, which uses a broader, more balanced methodology based on all funding sources."

This aligns with Schwab's discussion of managing interest rate risk through liability and asset duration, where Schwab explicitly states that changes in interest rates impact net interest margin and revenue, and that managing liability duration is a key part of their risk management strategy.

      "answer": "AIG reclassified a $37.6 billion loan receivable from AIGFP, which was deconsolidated following its Chapter 11 filing, while Schwab issued $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities and to maintain liquidity during the TD Ameritrade integration. AIG\u2019s action was tied to a restructuring event involving a formerly consolidated subsidiary with a full allowance for credit losses, indicating a reactive and potentially high-risk situation. In contrast, Schwab\u2019s issuance was a proactive liquidity management strategy in a rising interest rate environment. The scale difference highlights that AIG\u2019s debt strategy was significantly larger and tied to a distressed scenario, whereas Schwab\u2019s was smaller and forward-looking, aimed at ensuring balance sheet flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AIG reclassified a $37.6 billion loan receivable from AIGFP following its bankruptcy filing and deconsolidation.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Schwab issued $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities and maintain liquidity during the TD Ameritrade integration.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - AIG's reclassification was a result of a distressed restructuring event, while Schwab\u2019s issuance was a proactive liquidity measure. The magnitude of AIG\u2019s action was over six times larger than Schwab\u2019s, indicating different strategic priorities and urgency levels."

      "question": "How does the difference in accrued interest receivable treatment between AIG's commercial mortgage loans and Schwab's unsecured margin loans reflect contrasting approaches to interest recognition risk management?",
      "answer": "AIG reports accrued interest receivable of $183 million for commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2023, and explicitly states that interest income is not accrued when contractual payments are not expected, with accrual only resuming after delinquent payments are made for an appropriate period. This reflects a conservative approach tied to actual payment performance. In contrast, Schwab applies a practical expedient under ASC 326 for margin loans, where credit losses are estimated only on the unsecured portion if the collateral's fair value falls below amortized cost, and accrued interest on unsecured margin loans is charged off no later than 90 days past due. This shows a collateral-centric approach that relies heavily on the fair value of client-held securities as a primary risk mitigation mechanism. The difference in approaches highlights how AIG focuses on payment delinquency history while Schwab emphasizes collateral maintenance in managing interest recognition risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AIG's filing, identify the accrued interest receivable amount of $183 million for commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Step 2: Note AIG's policy that interest income is not accrued when payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected, and that accrual resumes only after delinquent payments have been made for an appropriate period.",
        "Step 3: From Schwab's filing, extract the policy that accrued interest on unsecured margin loans is charged off no later than 90 days past due, with credit losses estimated only on the unsecured portion when collateral fair value is less than amortized cost.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the two approaches: AIG's interest recognition is tied to payment delinquency history, while Schwab's is based on collateral value maintenance, reflecting distinct risk management strategies for interest receivable recognition."

      "answer": "Rising U.S. mortgage rates have impacted both Bank of America and Charles Schwab by influencing their credit risk modeling and allowance for credit losses. At Bank of America, higher mortgage rates have negatively affected housing affordability and demand for mortgage-related products, increasing the risk of credit losses in their consumer real estate exposure. This has placed upward pressure on their allowance for credit losses, as the accuracy of loss forecasts and borrower repayment capacity depend heavily on economic conditions, including interest rates. At Charles Schwab, mortgage rates are a key variable in their loan-level models for estimating credit losses in the residential real estate portfolio. These models incorporate current mortgage rates to project loan behavior over time, including delinquency transitions and loss severity, which directly informs the allowance for credit losses. Both institutions explicitly factor mortgage rates into their credit risk frameworks, making their loss estimates sensitive to changes in this macroeconomic indicator.",

Globally , conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions. If the macroeconomic environment or certain sectors worsen,  our  credit  portfolio,  net  charge-offs,  provision  and  allowance  for  credit losses could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe establish an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in our  relevant  financial  assets.  The  process  to  determine  the  allowance  for  credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments  that  are  often  interrelated,  including  forecasting  how  borrowers  or counterparties  may  perform  in  changing  economic  conditions.  The  ability  of  our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. There is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties, which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates.\n\nIf th e models, estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties, which are more sensitive due to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, prove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer losses in excess of our ECL. In addition, changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  our  b est  estimate  of  ECL,  b ut  th ere  is  no guarantee  that  it  will  b e  sufficient  to  ad d ress  cred it  losses,  p articularly  if  th e economic outlook deteriorates significantly , quickly or unexpectedly. As circumstances  change,  we  may  increase  our  allowance,  which  would  reduce earnings. If economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral, and credit losses are unexpectedly worse, we may increase our provision for credit losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our  concentrations  of  credit  risk  could  adversely  affect  our  credit losses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe  may  be  subject  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  because  of  a  common characteristic  or  common  sensitivity  to  economic,  financial,  public  health  or business developments. Concentrations of credit risk may reside in  a  particular industry ,  geography ,  product,  asset  class,  counterparty  or  within  any  pool  of exposures  with  a  common  risk  characteristic.  A  deterioration  in  the  financial condition or prospects of a particular industry , geographic location, product or asset class, or a failure or downgrade of, or default by , any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated.\n\nWe  execute  a  high  volume  of transactions and  have  significant credit concentrations  with  respect  to  the  financial  services  industry ,  predominantly comprised  of  broker-dealers,  commercial  banks,  investment  banks,  insurance companies,  mutual  funds,  hedge  funds,  CCPs  and  other  institutional  clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. Defaults  by  one  or  more counterparties, or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses, defaults and related disputes and litigation.\n\nOur credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount  of  the  loan  or  derivatives  exposure,  which  may  occur  from  events  that impact the value of the collateral, such as a sudden change in asset price or fraud. Disputes  with  obligors  as  to  the  valuation  of  collateral  could  increase  with significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.  Also,  our  counterparty  credit  risk  can  increase  if  margin  posted  by counterparties  is  insufficient  to  cover  exposures  and  elevated  counterparty exposure is accompanied by the counterparty's likelihood of default.\n\nWe have concentrations of credit risk, including with respect to our consumer real  estate  and  consumer  credit  card  exposure,  as  well  as  our  commercial  real estate  and  asset  managers  and  funds  portfolios,  which  represent  a  significant percentage  of  our  overall  credit  portfolio.  Declining  home  price  valuations  and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses, defaults, delinquencies or credit losses. The impacts of earthquakes, as well as climate change, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes, could negatively impact collateral, the valuations of home or commercial real estate or our clients'  ability  and /or  willingness  to  pay  fees,  outstand ing  loans  or  afford   new products. This could also cause insurability risk and/or increased insurance costs to  clients.  Economic  weaknesses,  particularly  from  increases  in  inflation  or sustained  elevated  inflation,  adverse  business  conditions,  market  disruptions, adverse economic or market events, rising interest or capitalization rates, declining asset prices, greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration  in  real  estate  values  or  household  incomes  may  cause  us  to experience higher credit losses in our portfolios or write down the value of certain assets. We could also experience continued and long-term negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences or other industry disruptions.\n\nWe  also  enter  into  transactions  with  sovereign  nations,  U.S.  states  and municipalities.  Uncertain  economic  or  political  conditions  or  policies,  such  as economic sanctions or increased tariffs, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in commodity prices and social instability , could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk.\n\nLiquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize  the  value  of  our  positions,  increasing  concentrations,  which could increase RWA and the credit and market risk associated with our positions, and increase operational and litigation costs.\n\n## We  may  be  adversely  affected  by  weaknesses  in  the  U.S.  housing market.\n\nDuring  202 4,  the  U.S.  housing  market  continued  to  be  impacted  by  higher mortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that more than doubled from 2021,  and  higher  home  prices  (in  varying  degrees  among  markets)  that  have negatively impacted housing affordability and the demand for many of our products.

For securities loaned, Schwab typically receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned; the payables from these transactions are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations on the consolidated balance sheets. In instances where the Company is acting as the lender and receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral, the Company recognizes the collateral received at fair value and the obligation to return the collateral in the consolidated balance sheets. The market value of securities borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest ex pense. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for securities borrowed receivables.\n\n## Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses\n\nBank loans held for investments are recorded at amortized cost, which is comprised of the contractual principal amounts adjusted for unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Interest income on bank loans is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, management estimates an allowance for credit losses, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to arrive at the amount expected to be collected. The bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segments: residential real estate, PALs, and other loans. We use these segments when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. The residential real estate portfolio segment is divided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to provision for credit losses, included in other revenue, based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the ex isting portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss ex perience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nSubstantially all PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical ex pedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using a loan-level model that projects each loan's behavior over its term based on forecasted voluntary housing turnover, the rates of refinancing, delinquency transition rates, and severity of loss. The model takes into account the current relevant risk indicators, including each loan's term and structure, current delinquency status, and the estimated current LTV ratio, as well as borrower FICO scores and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, Prime, and mortgage rates. The more significant variables in the model include delinquency roll rates, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss ex perience over a full economic cycle. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on forecasted net equity associated with each loan and property, as well as loss ex perience and market trends, both current and forecasted. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Mortgage rates are estimated based on forecasted spread, while the rest of the interest rates used by the model are projected based on the forward rates. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.",

      "answer": "BAC's Net Interest Spread decreased from 1.18% in 2023 to 1.01% in 2024, which contributed to a decline in Net Interest Income from $57,498 million in 2023 to $56,679 million in 2024. This narrowing spread indicates less favorable conditions for generating interest income relative to the cost of funds. In contrast, SCHW actively manages its Net Interest Revenue sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations through dynamic balance sheet adjustments and derivative instruments. SCHW's modeling assumes both static and dynamic balance sheet scenarios to assess the impact of interest rate changes on Net Interest Revenue over a 12-month horizon, highlighting a strategic approach to mitigate the effects of rate volatility. Thus, while BAC experienced a measurable decline in Net Interest Income due to a lower spread, SCHW focuses on proactive modeling and management to stabilize Net Interest Revenue amidst changing rate environments.",

The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, and include derivative instruments. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, rates and balances of non-maturity client cash held on the balance sheet, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. We use independent third-party models to simulate net interest revenue sensitivity and related analyses. Fix ed income analytical vendors provide term structure models, prepayment speed models for mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans, and cash flow projections based on interest income, contractual maturities, and prepayments. The Company's net interest revenue sensitivity analyses utilize gradual parallel increases/decreases in interest rates over a twelve-month period, though we also regularly simulate the effects of nonparallel shifts and instantaneous shifts of interest rates on net interest revenue.\n\nNet interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, bank loans, and cash and cash equivalents. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. When we have liquidity needs that exceed our primary sources of funding, the Company has needed to utilize higher-cost funding sources, which can reduce net interest margin and net interest revenue.\n\nHigher prevailing short-term interest rates generally improve yields on shorter duration interest-earning assets. During periods of rapidly rising interest rates, clients tend to reallocate cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding, off-balance sheet, fix ed income investments and money market funds within Schwab's product offerings. This can result in lower interest-earning assets and/or may require supplemental funding with higher funding costs, which therefore tend to constrain net interest revenue when interest rates are moving rapidly higher. A decline in short-term interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company's investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest ex pense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin.\n\nNet interest revenue sensitivity analyses assume both static and dynamically-sized balance sheet composition. Statically-sized balance sheet modeling assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. While this approach is useful to isolate the impact of changes in interest rates on a statically-sized asset and liability structure, it does not capture changes to client cash allocations. We therefore also conduct dynamically-sized balance sheet compositions as a function of interest rates. Dynamic net interest revenue simulations assume deposit and client credit balance runoff is supplemented with wholesale borrowing when needed to fund assets through the simulation horizon. We also conduct similar simulations on EVE to capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on our balance sheet. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate ex posure, we have taken and would typically seek to take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment.\n\nThe following table assumes a statically-sized balance sheet with simulated changes to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2024 and 2023 of a gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:\n\n",

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio  segment,  the  primary  credit  quality  indicators  are  refreshed  L TV  and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed L TV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly . Home equity loans are evaluated using CL TV , which measures the carrying value of the Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of  th e  p rop erty  securing  th e  loa n,  refresh ed   q ua rterly .  FICO  score  m ea sures  th e creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower's credit history . FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit  quality  indicator  for  th e  Cred it  Card   and   Oth er  Consumer  portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total  loss.  Pass  rated   refers  to  all  loans  not  consid ered   reservab le  criticized .  In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.\n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators and gross chargeoffs for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by year of origination, except for revolving loans and revolving  loans  that  were  modified  into  term  loans,  which  are  shown  on  an aggregate basis at December 31, 2024.",

      "question": "What credit commitments did Bank of America (BAC) disclose for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) in its 2024 10-K filing, and how does Charles Schwab (SCHW) utilize HELOCs in its secured borrowing arrangements?",
      "answer": "Bank of America disclosed $44,280 million in total credit commitments for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) as of December 31, 2024. Charles Schwab utilizes HELOCs, among other collateral types, to secure borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), where pledged assets such as HELOCs determine the amount of secured borrowing available to its banking subsidiaries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BAC's 2024 10-K, extract the total HELOC credit commitments of $44,280 million as of December 31, 2024.",
        "Step 2: From SCHW's 2024 10-K, identify that HELOCs are among the types of collateral pledged to the FHLB to secure borrowing capacity.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize how BAC's disclosed HELOC commitments represent part of the broader pool of HELOC assets in the financial system, which SCHW can use as eligible collateral for secured borrowing under FHLB arrangements."

Incremental borrow ing capacity may be made available by pledging additional assets, subject to applicable facility terms. S ee below  and Item 8 - Note 13 for additional information. (1)\n\nSecured borrow ing capacity is made available based on the banking subsidiaries' or CS C's ability to provide collateral deemed acceptable by each respective counterparty. S ee below  and Item 8 - Note 18 for additional information. (2)\n\nSecured borrow ing capacity is made available based on CS &amp;Co's ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lenders as determined by the credit agreements. (3)\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, CS C entered into an unsecured committed revolving line of credit w ith various external banks. (4)\n\nN/A Not applicable.\n\nAvailable borrowing capacity from the FHLB and Federal Reserve facilities maintained by our banking subsidiaries is dependent on the value of assets pledged and the terms of the borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had additional investment securities with a par value of approximately $124 billion, or a fair value of approx imately $113 billion, available to be pledged to obtain additional capacity. Additional details regarding availability and use of these facilities is described below.\n\nAmounts available under secured credit facilities with the FHLB are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries' respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. CSC's banking subsidiaries must each maintain positive tangible capital, as defined by the FHFA, in order to place new draws upon these credit facilities, and the Company manages capital with consideration of minimum tangible capital ratios at our banking subsidiaries. Tangible capital pursuant to the requirements of the FHLB borrowing facilities for our banking subsidiaries is common equity less goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nOur banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Our banking subsidiaries may also engage with external financial institutions in repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities as another source of short-term liquidity. In addition, our banking subsidiaries are counterparties to the Standing Repo Facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; other than de minimis tests performed to satisfy the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's testing requirements, this facility was not used during 2024 and there were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024. CSC maintains standing bilateral repurchase agreements with external banks. Other than de minimis tests, these facilities were not used during 2024 and there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2024.\n\nCSC's ratings for Commercial Paper Notes were P1 by Moody's Investor Service (Moody's), A2 by Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Group (Standard &amp; Poor's), and F1 by Fitch Ratings, Ltd (Fitch) at December 31, 2024.

      "question": "How does the specific composition of Tier 2 capital disclosed by AXP in its 2023 filing compare to the regulatory capital disclosures made by SCHW regarding their Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, particularly in terms of the components and buffers they highlight?",
      "answer": "AXP specifically discloses the components of its Tier 2 capital, which include the allowance for credit losses (adjusted under CECL rules and limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets), and $1,250 million of eligible subordinated notes, with $500 million issued in July 2023 and $750 million issued in May 2022. In contrast, SCHW does not disclose specific components of Tier 2 capital but focuses on the regulatory minimums and buffers it must maintain, including a 2.5% stress capital buffer for CSC and a 2.5% capital conservation buffer for CSB, with total minimum capital ratio requirements of 10.5% for Total Risk-Based Capital as of December 31, 2023. This indicates that AXP provides detailed breakdowns of its capital instruments, while SCHW emphasizes its adherence to regulatory thresholds and buffer requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AXP's filing, extract the specific components of Tier 2 capital, including the allowance for credit losses and subordinated notes ($500 million in July 2023 and $750 million in May 2022).",
        "Step 2: From SCHW's filing, extract the regulatory capital requirements and buffers (2.5% stress capital buffer for CSC, 2.5% capital conservation buffer for CSB) and the resulting minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio (10.5%).",
        "Step 3: Compare the two disclosures \u2014 AXP provides granular detail on Tier 2 capital composition, while SCHW focuses on regulatory thresholds and buffers without specifying Tier 2 components.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize the comparison to highlight the differing approaches to capital disclosure: one focused on instrument-level detail, the other on compliance with regulatory thresholds."

      "answer": "A $15 billion increase in cross-jurisdictional activity would move American Express (AXP) from $60 billion to $75 billion on a four-quarter trailing average, potentially reclassifying it from Category III to Category II under the enhanced prudential standards. This would subject AXP to more stringent capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, including the advanced approaches capital framework. For Charles Schwab (SCHW), increasing its cross-jurisdictional activity from $25 billion to $40 billion would not trigger a category change, as it remains below the $75 billion threshold for Category II, so it would remain under Category III requirements, including the standardized approach framework and stress capital buffer.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AXP's cross-jurisdictional activity is $60 billion (four-quarter trailing average), placing it in Category III, with potential to move to Category II if it reaches $75 billion.",

      "question": "How do the changes in noninterest expense for Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase in 2023 relate to their respective changes in net income, based on the specific figures disclosed in their financial statements?",
      "answer": "Bank of America reported a $1.0 billion decrease in net income in 2023, which was partially attributed to an increase in noninterest expense, although the exact dollar amount of that increase is not disclosed. JPMorgan Chase, on the other hand, reported a $11.876 billion increase in net income in 2023 (from $37.676 billion in 2022 to $49.552 billion in 2023), while its noninterest expense increased by $614 million (from $2.817 billion to $3.431 billion). This suggests that while both banks experienced an increase in noninterest expense, only Bank of America cited it as a contributing factor to a decline in net income, whereas JPMorgan Chase's net income still increased despite higher expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BAC's 2023 10-K filing, we learn that net income decreased by $1.0 billion year-over-year ('$26.5 billion in 2023 vs. $27.5 billion in 2022'), and that this was 'primarily due to higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses.' However, the exact dollar increase in noninterest expense is not disclosed.",
        "Step 2: From JPM's 2023 10-K filing, we extract specific figures: net income increased by $11.876 billion (from $37.676 billion in 2022 to $49.552 billion in 2023), and noninterest expense increased by $614 million (from $2.817 billion in 2022 to $3.431 billion in 2023).",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both sets of data, we observe that while both banks reported increases in noninterest expense, only BAC cited it as a reason for a decline in net income. JPM's net income increased significantly despite a rise in noninterest expense, indicating differing financial impacts of the expense change at each institution."

This combined expense is 1.19 times greater than BAC's individual fourth-quarter noninterest expense.",

      "answer": "The decline in average deposit balances negatively affected both Bank of America's Global Transaction Services revenue and JPMorgan's net interest income in 2023. For Bank of America, Global Transaction Services revenue increased by $1.0 billion, but this growth was partially offset by the impact of lower average deposit balances. For JPMorgan, net interest income (NII) was $89.3 billion, and the decline in average deposit balances was explicitly cited as a factor that partially offset otherwise stronger NII performance driven by higher interest rates and other factors. This shows that despite overall positive trends in interest rate environments, the reduction in deposit balances constrained revenue growth in both institutions.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, extract that Bank of America's Global Transaction Services revenue increase of $1.0 billion was partially offset by lower average deposit balances.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize that both financial institutions experienced a constraint on revenue growth due to the same financial trend \u2014 declining average deposit balances \u2014 even though the specific revenue lines and magnitudes differed."

      "answer": "MS held $81,909 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks at the end of 2023. COF's interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $6,583 million between 2022 and 2023. This means that MS's interest-bearing deposits are significantly larger in scale compared to the annual increase in COF's interest expense on similar liabilities.",

        "Step 1: From MS's 2023 10-K filing, extract the value of interest-bearing deposits with banks at the end of 2023, which is $81,909 million.",

These disclosures provide stakeholders with detailed insights into the company's capital adequacy and risk management practices as required under Basel III. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, emphasizes maintaining sufficient capital to operate during adverse economic conditions, which directly supports the Basel III objective of enhancing banking sector resilience. Both strategies reflect different aspects of Basel III compliance: BNY Mellon focuses on transparency and disclosure, while Wells Fargo prioritizes capital preservation during economic stress.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BNY Mellon's capital management disclosures include Pillar 3 Disclosures, Liquidity Coverage Ratio Disclosures, and Net Stable Funding Ratio Disclosures, indicating a focus on transparency.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Wells Fargo highlights its strategy of maintaining sufficient capital to continue operations during adverse economic conditions.",

      "question": "How do BK's regulatory constraints on capital returns and V's dividend payments in fiscal 2022 together highlight contrasting approaches to shareholder capital distribution within the financial sector?",
      "answer": "BK states that its ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to regulatory limitations, including U.S. banking laws governing capital adequacy and its failure to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock. In contrast, V paid $3.2 billion in dividends during fiscal 2022 and maintained an active share repurchase program, including $5.2 billion remaining under its December 2021 authorization as of September 30, 2022. These differences illustrate how regulatory constraints on a bank holding company like BK can limit capital distributions, while a payments company like V, not subject to the same banking regulations, can more freely return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BK's 10-K, extract the regulatory and capital constraint language limiting its ability to return capital to shareholders, including the impact of preferred stock dividend obligations.",
        "Step 2: From V's 10-K, extract the specific $3.2 billion dividend payout in fiscal 2022 and the remaining $5.2 billion in share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2022.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two perspectives by contrasting BK's regulatory limitations with V's active capital return strategy, noting that they operate under different regulatory frameworks despite both being in the financial sector."

Average repurchase price per share and total cost are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2)\n\nIn  January 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized a $8.0 billion share repurchase program and in December 2021, authorized an additional $12.0 billion share repurchase program (December 2021 Program). As of September 30, 2022, the Company's December 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the December 2021 Program have been completed. In October 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date.\n\nDividends. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company declared and paid dividends of $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion and  $2.7  billion,  respectively.  On  October  21,  2022,  the  Company's  board  of  directors  declared  a  quarterly  cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on December 1, 2022, to all holders of record as of November 11, 2022.\n\nClass B common stock. The class B common stock is not convertible or transferable until the date on which all of the U.S. covered litigation has been finally resolved. This transfer restriction is subject to limited exceptions, including transfers to other holders of class B common stock. After termination of the restrictions, the class B common stock will be convertible into class A common stock if transferred to a person that was not a Visa Member (as defined in the current  certificate  of  incorporation)  or  similar  person  or  an  affiliate  of  a  Visa  Member  or  similar  person.  Upon  such transfer, each share of class B common stock will automatically convert into a number of shares of class A common stock based upon the applicable conversion rate in effect at the time of such transfer.\n\nAdjustment of the conversion rate occurs upon: (i) the completion of any follow-on offering of class A common stock completed to increase the size of the U.S. litigation escrow account (or any cash deposit by the Company in lieu thereof)  resulting  in  a  further  corresponding  decrease  in  the  conversion  rate;  or  (ii)  the  final  resolution  of  the  U.S. covered litigation and the release of funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. litigation escrow account to the Company resulting in a corresponding  increase  in  the  conversion  rate.  See Note  5-U.S.  and  Europe  Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nClass C common stock. There are no existing transfer restrictions on class C common stock. As of September 30, 2022, a total of 142 million shares have been converted from class C to class A common stock upon their sale into the public market.\n\nPreferred stock. In  connection with the Visa Europe acquisition, three series of preferred stock of the Company were created. Upon issuance, all of the preferred stock participate on an as-converted basis in regular quarterly cash dividends declared on the Company's class A common stock. Preferred stock may be issued as redeemable or nonredeemable,  and  has  preference  over  any  class  of  common  stock  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  dividends  and distribution of the Company's assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution.",

      "answer": "Capital One (COF) reported an increase in purchase volume, which directly contributes to the 'purchase volume' component of Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) as defined by Mastercard (MA). MA defines GDV as the sum of purchase volume and cash volume (e.g., cash disbursements, balance transfers, and convenience checks). Since COF\u2019s increase is specifically in 'purchase volume,' it maps directly to the portion of GDV that excludes cash volume, meaning the rise in COF's purchase volume contributes proportionally to the growth in MA's GDV, particularly on a local currency and U.S. dollar-converted basis.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COF\u2019s 10-K filing, we learn that 'higher net interchange fees' were driven by an 'increase in purchase volume.'",
        "Step 2: From MA\u2019s 10-K filing, we learn that GDV includes both 'purchase volume' and 'cash volume,' with 'purchase volume' defined as the 'aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards.'",
        "Step 3: Since COF\u2019s increase is in 'purchase volume,' it directly contributes to the GDV metric as defined by MA, specifically the portion that excludes cash disbursements and balance transfers.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the risk-free rate of return used by MetLife and Visa impact the fair value of stock-based compensation grants, given their respective valuation approaches and volatility assumptions?",
      "answer": "MetLife uses a binomial lattice model that incorporates varying risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury Strip forward rates over the contractual term of the option, while Visa uses a single average risk-free rate of 0.5% in 2022. Visa\u2019s fair value per performance-based share granted in 2022 was $186.50, down from $229.81 in 2021, during which the risk-free rate increased from 0.2% to 0.5%. This suggests that the rise in the risk-free rate contributed to a lower fair value, consistent with the principle that higher risk-free rates increase the present value of future cash flows less significantly. MetLife, by contrast, dynamically adjusts for interest rate changes over time, which may lead to more nuanced fair value outcomes depending on the term structure of interest rates.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - MetLife uses a binomial lattice model that incorporates varying risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual term of the option.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Visa used a risk-free rate of 0.5% in 2022, up from 0.2% in 2021, and reported a decline in fair value per performance-based share from $229.81 to $186.50.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in Visa\u2019s risk-free rate coincided with a drop in fair value, suggesting a negative relationship between the risk-free rate and option value. MetLife\u2019s approach, which uses forward rates across the term, may reflect a more dynamic sensitivity to interest rate changes over time."

The aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding Stock Options is computed using the closing Share price on December 31, 2021 of $62.49 and December 31, 2020 of $46.95, as applicable.\n\n(2) Expired options were exercisable, but unexercised, as of their expiration date.\n\n(3) Forfeited  awards  were  either  (a)  unvested  or  unexercisable  at  the  end  of  the  awardholder's  employment,  where  the awardholder did not meet the criteria for post-employment award continuation; or (b) held by awardholders the Company terminated from employment for cause as defined in the terms of the awards.\n\nMetLife estimates  the  fair  value  of  Stock  Options  on  the  date  of  grant  using  a  binomial  lattice  model.  The  significant assumptions the Company uses in its binomial lattice model include: expected volatility of the price of Shares; risk-free rate of return; dividend yield on Shares; exercise multiple; and the post-vesting termination rate.\n\nMetLife bases expected volatility on an analysis of historical prices of Shares and call options on Shares traded on the open market.  The  Company  uses  a  weighted-average  of  the  implied  volatility  for  publicly-traded  call  options  with  the  longest remaining maturity nearest to the money as of each valuation date and the historical volatility, calculated using monthly closing prices  of  Shares.  The  Company  chose  a  monthly  measurement  interval  for  historical  volatility  as  this  interval  reflects  the Company's view that employee option exercise decisions are based on longer-term trends in the price of the underlying Shares rather than on daily price movements.\n\nThe  Company's  binomial  lattice  model  incorporates  different  risk-free  rates  based  on  the  imputed  forward  rates  for U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual term of the option. The table below presents the full range of rates that were used for options granted during the respective periods.\n\nThe Company determines dividend yield based on historical dividend distributions compared to the price of the underlying Shares as of the valuation date and held constant over the life of the Stock Option.\n\nThe Company's binomial lattice model incorporates the term of the Stock Options, expected exercise behavior and a postvesting  termination  rate,  or  the  rate  at  which  vested  options  are  exercised  or  expire  prematurely  due  to  termination  of employment. From these factors, the model derives an expected life of the Stock Option. The model's exercise behavior is a multiple that reflects the ratio of stock price at the time of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Option at the time the model expects holders to exercise. The model derives the exercise multiple from actual exercise activity. The model determines the post-vesting termination rate from actual exercise experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "question": "How does the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on MET's 2021 non-VA program derivatives compare to Visa's use of established exchange rates in calculating nominal payments volume, and what does this reveal about the financial significance of exchange rates for each company's operations?",
      "answer": "MET reported a $429 million loss in 2021 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its non-VA program derivatives, indicating a direct financial impact from currency movements. Meanwhile, Visa uses established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates to calculate its nominal payments volume, which is a key metric for determining service revenues. This shows that while exchange rates directly affect MET's derivative valuations and thus its financial performance, Visa incorporates exchange rates into its volume measurement to maintain consistency in revenue reporting across different currencies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From MET's 2022 10-K, we extract the $429 million loss attributed to foreign currency exchange rate changes in the non-VA program derivatives for 2021.",
        "Step 2: From Visa's 2022 10-K, we extract the explanation that it applies 'established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency' to calculate nominal payments volume, which directly influences service revenues.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are exposed to foreign exchange rates, but in different ways: MET experiences direct financial losses from currency movements affecting derivatives, whereas Visa uses standardized exchange rates to report consistent payments volume, which underpins its revenue generation."

See 'Note  16-Income  Taxes'  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  Form  10-K  for  more  information  on  our effective tax rate.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe  require  liquidity  and  access  to  capital  to  fund  our  global  operations,  including  customer  protection  programs,  our  credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other  cash  needs.

The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.\n\nWe employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.\n\n## Primary Funding Sources\n\nSchwab's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients.\n\nOther sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.\n\nTo meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.\n\n## Additional Funding Sources\n\nIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interestearning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.\n\nThe following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "PayPal's credit loss provisions were affected by charge-offs tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, particularly the impact of the pandemic in 2020, which led to increased charge-offs due to financial difficulties experienced by merchants. PayPal charges off receivables for its PPBL product after 180 days past the contractual repayment date, and for PPWC after 360 days or under specific conditions. These charge-offs are recognized in transaction and credit losses. In contrast, Schwab actively managed credit risk in its mortgage lending portfolio through underwriting guidelines, including maximum LTV ratios and minimum FICO scores, and by regularly reviewing asset quality metrics such as delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. Schwab's credit loss provisions were influenced by its proactive review process and its avoidance of subprime loans unless compensating factors were present. Therefore, PayPal's credit loss provisions were more directly tied to merchant loan charge-off timing and portfolio performance, while Schwab's were shaped by structured underwriting and ongoing portfolio reviews.",

Additionally, charge offs increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to accounts that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor  merchant  loans  and  advances,  the  determination  of  delinquency  is  based  on  the  current  expected  or  contractual  repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days  of  receiving  notification  of  bankruptcy.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  on  merchant  loans  and  advances  is  recognized  in transaction and credit losses, and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n## Troubled debt restructurings\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due. These modifications are intended to provide merchants with financial relief, and help enable us to mitigate losses.\n\nThese modifications include an increase in term by approximately 1 to 5.5 years while moving the delinquency status to current. The fee on certain of these loans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial  fixed  fee  structure  at  the  time  the  loan  or  advance  was  extended  with  a  fixed  annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to accrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off. These modifications had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statements of income in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAllowances for TDRs are assessed separately from other loans and advances within our portfolio and are determined by estimating current  expected  credit  losses  utilizing  the  modified  term  and  interest  rate  assumptions.  Historical  loss  estimates  are  utilized  in addition to macroeconomic assumptions to determine expected credit loss rates. Further, we may include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses.\n\nThe following tables  show  the  merchant  loans  and  interest  receivables  which  have  been  modified  as TDRs  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

      "answer": "The total combined accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities for PYPL and SCHW as of December 31, 2021, is $719 million. This includes $36 million for PYPL and $683 million for SCHW. Both companies disclose that accrued interest receivable on AFS securities is excluded from the amortized cost basis of these securities and instead is included in other current assets (for PYPL) or other assets (for SCHW) on their consolidated balance sheets.

In contrast, SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans when calculating its allowance for credit losses, indicating that accrued interest is treated separately and not subject to the same credit risk provisions as the principal loan amounts.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\ndivided into two classes of financing receivables for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit risk: First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nSchwab records an allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings based on our estimate of current expected credit losses for the existing portfolio. We review the allowance for credit losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and any other risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an appropriate level.\n\nPALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized and borrowers are required to maintain collateral at specified levels at all times. The required collateral levels are determined based on the type of security pledged. Additionally, collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower's credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited. Schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an allowance for credit losses for PALs.\n\nThe methodology to establish an allowance for credit losses for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected losses for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segment. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the classes of financing receivables, including loan products within those classes, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.\n\nExpected credit losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, borrower FICO scores, and current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury, SOFR, and LIBOR rates. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, interest rates, and the unemployment rate. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information, which includes current and forecasted conditions. Loss severity (i.e., loss given default) estimates are based on our historical loss experience and market trends, both current and forecasted. The loss severity estimate used in the allowance for credit loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. The unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic surveys. Linear interpolation is applied to revert to long-term trends after the reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe methodology described above results in loss factors that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loans, exclusive of accrued interest receivable, to determine the allowance for credit losses for First Mortgages and HELOCs.\n\nManagement also estimates a liability for expected credit losses on the Company's commitments to extend credit related to unused HELOCs and commitments to purchase first mortgages. See Note 15 for additional information on these commitments. The liability is calculated by applying the loss factors described above to the commitments expected to be funded and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for expected credit losses on these commitments and related activity were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\nSchwab considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).\n\n## Nonaccrual, nonperforming and impaired loans\n\nFirst Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. HELOC loans secured by a second lien are placed on non-accrual status if the associated first lien is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status.",

      "answer": "MA has $586 million in restricted cash for litigation settlement, while MET explicitly recognizes liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters as part of its critical accounting estimates. MA's litigation-related liability is a concrete, reserved amount representing a specific portion of its total liabilities ($586M / $30,257M = ~1.94%). MET, on the other hand, discusses litigation liabilities qualitatively without providing a specific dollar figure, suggesting a potentially broader or less-defined exposure to litigation risks compared to MA.",

For  a  discussion  of  our significant  accounting  policies,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  most  critical  estimates include those used in determining:\n\n- (i) liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n\n(ii) capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n\n(iii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n\n(iv) investment allowance for credit loss ('ACL') and impairments;\n\n(v) estimated  fair  values  of  freestanding  derivatives  and  the  recognition  and  estimated  fair  value  of  embedded  derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n\n(vi) measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n\n(vii) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n\n(viii) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n\n(ix) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Liability for Future Policy Benefits\n\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value  of  future  expected  benefits  to  be  paid,  reduced  by  the  present  value  of  future  expected  premiums.  Such  liabilities  are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions  used  in  the  establishment  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  are  mortality,  morbidity,  policy  lapse,  renewal, retirement,  disability  incidence,  disability  terminations,  investment  returns,  inflation,  expenses  and  other  contingent  events  as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established  on  a  block  of  business  basis.  If  experience  is  less  favorable  than  assumed,  additional  liabilities  may  be  established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nFuture  policy  benefit  liabilities  for  disabled  lives  are  estimated  using  the  present  value  of  benefits  method  and  experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the  effects  of  current  developments,  anticipated  trends  and  risk  management  programs,  reduced  for  anticipated  salvage  and subrogation.\n\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  Liabilities  for  ULSG  and  paid-up  guarantees  are  determined  by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits  ratably  over  the  accumulation  period  based  on  total  expected  assessments.  The  assumptions  used  in  estimating  the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n\nWe  regularly  review  our  estimates  of  liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  and  compare  them  with  our  actual  experience. Differences  between  actual  experience  and  the  assumptions  used  in  pricing  these  policies  and  guarantees,  as  well  as  in  the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.",

          "chunk_text": "- Fair value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability ('hedged item') that is attributable to the hedged risk. All amounts recognized in earnings are recorded to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statement of operations as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Hedged items are measured on the consolidated balance sheet at their carrying amount adjusted for any changes in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  ('basis  adjustments').  The  Company  defers  the  amortization  of  any  basis adjustments until the end of the derivative instrument's term. If the hedge designation is discontinued for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item, the remaining basis adjustments are amortized in accordance with applicable GAAP for the hedged item.\n- Net investment hedges - The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.  The  effective  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  related  to  the  hedging  instruments  are  reported  in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  a  cumulative  translation  adjustment component of equity. Gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings only if the Company sells or substantially liquidates its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.\n\nSettlement  assets/obligations -  The  Company  operates  systems  for  settling  payment  transactions  among  participants  in  the payments ecosystem in which the Company operates. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day basis, however, in some circumstances, funds may not settle until subsequent business days. In addition, the Company may receive or post funds in advance of  transactions related to certain payment capabilities over its multi-rail payments network. The Company classifies the balances arising from these various activities as settlement assets and settlement obligations.\n\nProperty,  equipment  and  right-of-use  assets -  Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements and amortization of finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Operating lease amortization expense is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThe useful lives of the Company's assets are as follows:\n\n",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Leases\n\nThe  Company,  as  lessee,  has  entered  into  various  lease  and  sublease  agreements  for  office  space  and  equipment.  At contract inception, the Company determines that an arrangement contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For contracts that contain a lease, the Company recognizes the ROU asset in Other assets and the lease liability in Other liabilities. The Company evaluates whether a ROU asset is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the associated lease costs are recorded as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are determined using the Company's incremental borrowing rate based upon information available at commencement date to recognize the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include lease payments and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease and are included in the lease measurement when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\n\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company does not separate lease and nonlease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component for all asset classes.\n\nThe majority of the Company's leases and subleases are operating leases related to office space. The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include fees related to service contracts from customers for vision fee for service arrangements, prepaid  legal  plans,  administrative  services-only  contracts,  and  investment  management  services.  Substantially  all  of  the revenue  from  the  services  is  recognized  over  time  as  the  applicable  services  are  provided  or  are  made  available  to  the customers. The revenue recognized includes variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. In addition to the service fees, other revenues also include certain stable value fees and other miscellaneous revenues. These fees and miscellaneous revenues are recognized as earned.\n\n## Policyholder Dividends\n\nPolicyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance subsidiaries' boards of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholder  dividends  is  related  to  actual  interest,  mortality,  morbidity  and  expense  experience  for  the  year,  as  well  as management's judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators. For  most  of  the  Company's  foreign  operations,  the  local  currency  is  the  functional  currency.  For  certain  other  foreign operations,  such  as  Japan,  the  local  currency  and  one  or  more  other  currencies  qualify  as  functional  currencies. Assets  and liabilities of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are translated from the functional currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited directly to OCI, net of applicable taxes. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including the effect of re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities to the appropriate functional currency, are reported as part of net investment gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  common  share  are  computed  based  on  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares,  or  their equivalent,  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  earnings  per  common  share  include  the  dilutive  effect  of  the  assumed exercise  or  issuance  of  stock-based  awards  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Under  the  treasury  stock  method,  exercise  or issuance of stock-based awards is assumed to occur with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.",

      "answer": "The discontinuation of LIBOR may impact the competitiveness of MET's products because differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates could affect the value, return, and marketability of MET's financial instruments and investment products. This uncertainty could reduce product attractiveness and impair cash or derivative positions if MET fails to effectively manage the transition. This issue may be compounded by the increased regulatory focus described in MA's filing, where stricter data privacy laws and sector-specific regulations in the payments industry could restrict MA's ability to leverage data for innovation, increase compliance costs, and reduce the competitiveness of its products. If MA's customers face higher costs due to these regulations, they may issue fewer payment products, which could reduce the volume of transactions processed through MA's systems. This, in turn, could reduce demand for integrated financial services like those offered by MET, further pressuring product competitiveness across the ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the European Union, and policymakers around the globe are using these requirements as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy laws that could result in similar or stricter requirements in other jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, process and/or store data within  their  borders,  as  well  as  prohibitions  on  the  transfer  of  data  abroad,  leading  to  technological  and  operational  implications. Other  jurisdictions  have  adopted  or  are  otherwise  considering  adopting  sector-specific  regulations  for  the  payments  industry, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements, as well as regulations on artificial intelligence and data governance, that overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and  requirements  could  result  in  fines,  sanctions  or  other  penalties,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  results  of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\n\nNew  requirements  or  changing  interpretations  of  existing  requirements  in  these  areas,  or  the  development  of  new  regulatory schemes  related  to  the  digital  economy  in  general,  may  also  increase  our  costs  and/or  restrict  our  ability  to  leverage  data  for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need  for  improved  data  management,  governance  and  quality  practices,  the  development  of  information-based  products  and solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products,  which  may,  in  turn,  decrease  the  number  of  our  payment  products  that  they  issue.  Moreover,  due  to  account  data compromise  events  and  privacy  abuses  by  other  companies,  as  well  as  the  disclosure  of  monitoring  activities  by  certain governmental  agencies  in  combination  with  the  use  of  artificial  intelligence  and  new  technologies,  there  has  been  heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements and/or future enforcement. Those  developments  have  also  raised  public  attention  on  companies'  data  practices  and  have  changed  consumer  and  societal expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nIn  addition,  fraudulent  activity  and  increasing  cyberattacks  have  encouraged  legislative  and  regulatory  intervention,  and  could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or increase our compliance costs.  Criminals  are  using  increasingly  sophisticated  methods  to  capture  consumer  personal  information  to  engage  in  illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud. As outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. While we are taking measures to make card and  digital  payments  more  secure,  increased  fraud  levels  involving  our  integrated  products  and  services,  or  misconduct  or negligence  by  third  parties  switching  or  otherwise  servicing  our  integrated  products  and  services,  could  lead  to  legislative  or regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements and liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.\n\n## Other Regulation\n\nRegulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  regulations  that  affect  the  payments  industry  in  the  many  jurisdictions  in  which  our  integrated  products  and services are used. Many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that, at times, consequently affect us. Regulation of the payments industry, including regulations applicable to us and our customers, has increased significantly in the last several years. See 'Business - Government Regulation' in Part I, Item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation. Examples include:\n\n- Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption -  We  are  subject  to AML and CFT laws and regulations globally. Economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies, and persons and entities. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage.\n- Account-based Payments Systems -  In  the  U.K.,  aspects  of  our  Vocalink  business  are  subject  to  the  U.K.  payment system oversight regime and are directly overseen by the Bank of England.\n- Issuer  and  Acquirer  Practices  Legislation  and  Regulation -  Certain  regulations  (such  as  PSD2  in  the  EEA)  may  impact various  aspects  of  our  business.  For  example,  PSD2's  strong  authentication  requirement  could  increase  the  number  of transactions  that  consumers  abandon  if  we  are  unable  to  secure  a  frictionless  authentication  experience  under  the  new standards. An increase in the rate of abandoned transactions could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics.\n\nIncreased regulatory focus on us, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may result in costly compliance burdens and/or  may  otherwise  increase  our  costs.  Similarly,  increased  regulatory  focus  on  our  customers  may  cause  such  customers  to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures,",

Most settings ceased at the end of December 2021 and the remaining U.S. Dollar settings (overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR) will cease at the end  of  June  2023.  We  continue  to  actively  transition  to  the  alternative  reference  rates.  Differences  between  LIBOR  and  the applicable  alternative  reference  rates  may  impact  the  value  of,  return  on,  and  markets  for,  a  broad  array  of  our  products,  our financial instruments, the instruments in which we invest, or interest rates on our borrowing or debt. The effects on our business and investments  will  vary  depending  on  the  transition  of  our  existing  LIBOR  contracts  to  alternative  reference  rates,  including  the adequacy  of  LIBOR  fallback  provisions  in  such  contracts  and  whether,  how,  and  when  industry  participants  adopt  alternative reference rates for new products or instruments. Uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, regarding the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments, or regarding the application or effectiveness of alternative reference rates, could increase our costs, reduce the value of such instruments, or impair our  cash  or  derivative  positions.  We  may  not  effectively  hedge  or  manage  risks  from  differences  among  applicable  alternative reference rates or timing of when such rates take effect.\n\nWe may fail to adequately prepare for or react to LIBOR discontinuation and replacement, or fail to fully protect ourselves from all the effects of such changes. We may also fail to manage adequately any transition to alternative reference rates in a way that  maintains  the  competitiveness  of  our  products  and  the  performance  of  our  investment  portfolio.  Our  transition  may  not effectively protect other aspects of our business, such as our operations and the accuracy of the financial models and valuations we use to gauge our risks, for financial reporting, or other purposes.\n\nAny such uncertainties or ineffective management may harm our reputation, our relationships with our investors, customers, or regulators, our financial condition, and our business operations.\n\n## Our Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors' or Regulators' Expectations\n\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of ESG standards and expectations. Some of our regulators have proposed or announced that they plan to propose ESG rules or announced that they intend to review our practices against ESG standards; others may yet do so. Further, we define our own corporate purpose, in part, by the sustainability of our practices and our impact on all our stakeholders.\n\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear or readily measurable.  These  standards  and  expectations  may  also,  as  a  whole,  reflect  contrasting  or  conflicting  values  or  agendas.  Our decisions or priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of multiple business goals and interests. Our practices may not change in the particulars or at the rate stakeholders expect. As a result, our efforts to conduct our business in accordance with some or all these expectations may involve trade-offs. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or fully satisfy investors, regulators, or others. Customers and potential customers may be prohibited or choose not to do business with us based on our sustainability practices and related policies and actions. We may face adverse regulatory, investor, media, or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational, or legal challenges.\n\n## Capital Risks\n\n## We May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase reported an allowance for loan losses of $5,005 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting its large and diversified loan portfolio. PayPal's outstanding balance in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion as of the same date, significantly smaller in scale. The allowance for loan losses at JPM is designed to cover potential credit losses across a broad range of loans, while PayPal's credit risk is concentrated in its merchant finance products like PPWC and PPBL, where repayment depends on merchants' payment processing volumes. The difference in scale indicates that JPM has a much larger and systemically important lending operation, while PayPal\u2019s lending is more specialized and tied to its digital payments ecosystem.",

      "answer": "PayPal (PYPL) expanded its acceptable risk parameters in 2022, leading to a decline in the overall credit quality of its loans, particularly in its PayPal Business Loan (PPBL) product. This resulted in increased delinquencies and a higher net charge-off rate for merchant receivables by the end of 2023. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) projects a net charge-off rate in Card Services of less than 3.50% for 2024, indicating a more conservative credit risk strategy in its consumer lending business. The divergence in strategies suggests that while PYPL took a more aggressive approach to lending in 2022, which backfired, JPM is maintaining tighter credit controls in its Card Services segment to manage credit losses.",

In contrast, Charles Schwab states that Principal Transactions Revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions. This indicates that JPMorgan's presentation is more focused on valuation adjustments and hedging, while Schwab's is tied directly to client trading activity.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of fair value changes in securities financing agreements at JPMorgan Chase influence the composition of principal transactions revenue reported by Charles Schwab, given their respective roles in fixed income markets?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase reports changes in fair value of certain securities financing agreements, for which the fair value option has been elected, directly into principal transactions revenue. This includes adjustments related to embedded derivatives in hybrid instruments, where all fair value changes, including interest elements, are also captured in principal transactions revenue. At Charles Schwab, principal transactions revenue is recognized primarily from accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions. Given that JPMorgan may be a counterparty in these financing arrangements, the fair value adjustments it records could directly affect the valuation of securities positions held by Schwab, thereby influencing the level of principal transactions revenue Schwab reports. This interplay highlights how valuation practices at one institution can impact revenue recognition at another engaged in similar market activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - JPMorgan Chase reports changes in fair value of certain securities financing agreements (for which the fair value option has been elected) into principal transactions revenue, including adjustments related to embedded derivatives in hybrid instruments.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Charles Schwab reports principal transactions revenue primarily from accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity, which includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - If JPMorgan Chase is a counterparty in Schwab\u2019s securities financing or fixed income trading activities, the fair value adjustments made by JPMorgan would directly influence the valuation of related positions at Schwab, thus affecting Schwab\u2019s principal transactions revenue."

This indicates that V experienced some level of employee stock option turnover or unvested option cancellation during the reporting period, whereas COF did not report any forfeitures, suggesting better retention or different vesting dynamics in their stock compensation plans.",

Given Capital One's $10 million impairment of intangible assets in 2022 and Visa's $955 million amortization expense in fiscal 2024, how do these expenses reflect different strategies in managing acquired versus internally developed technology assets?",
      "answer": "Capital One's $10 million impairment of intangible assets in 2022 indicates a minor write-down of value in acquired customer relationships or brand assets, suggesting that its acquisition-based intangible assets have remained largely stable. In contrast, Visa's $955 million amortization expense in fiscal 2024 specifically for technology reflects a significant ongoing investment in and depreciation of internally developed or acquired technology infrastructure. This contrast shows that Capital One's strategy involves relatively stable long-term intangible assets from acquisitions, while Visa is actively investing in and amortizing technology assets at a much higher rate, pointing to different strategic focuses: customer acquisition versus technology development.",

      "answer": "AXP accounts for merchant relationships primarily through risk exposure, noting that spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7% of its worldwide billed business, which directly impacts revenue through discount rates and potential losses from non-delivery of services. COF, on the other hand, treats merchant relationships as part of its intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, with no impairments recorded in 2024. This shows a fundamental difference in financial treatment: AXP reflects merchant relationship value through ongoing revenue risk and exposure, while COF capitalizes and amortizes the value as a balance sheet intangible.",

See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.\n\nSimilarly, we are ex posed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or 'flown.' If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor additional information relating to operational risks of our business partners, see ' We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business ' below.\n\n## We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly ex panding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rates and network and loan volumes.\n\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\n\n## Surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nIn certain countries, such as Australia, Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are permitted by law to engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices for certain card purchases and certain merchants and merchant organizations continue to push for these practices in other jurisdictions. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, such as limiting the use of our cards for certain transactions. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members' expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nRecently introduced products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other",

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a business segment are included in the Other category, such as the management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability positions performed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and any residual tax expense or benefit beyond what is assessed to our business segments in order to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate. The Other category also includes unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain restructuring charges and integration expenses related to the Transaction.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. We use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. Our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. The net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. Our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each business segment. The allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our 'managed' presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and provide a comparative discussion of these results for 2024 and 2023, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## LIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS\n\nThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and statement credits. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on changes in cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and developments in redemption patterns, which may be impacted by product refreshes, changes in redemption options and mix of proprietary cards-in-force.\n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2024, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $197 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $220 million.\n\n## GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business environment, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment.\n\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment.",

If markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.\n\nSignificant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. We discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 17-Fair Value Measurement.'\n\nWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification, and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.\n\nGroups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include verification of fair value measurements at least quarterly to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information.\n\nOur Fair V alue Committee ('FVC'), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC reviews and approves our fair valuations at least quarterly to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.\n\nWe have model policies, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which govern the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance.\n\nThe fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the V aluations Advisory Committee ('VAC') for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer ('CFO') and includes other members of senior management. There were no disputes escalated to the VAC for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Customer Rewards Reserve\n\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. The majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. We establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.\n\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our current assumption is that the substantial majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted  as  appropriate  for  recent  changes  in  redemption  costs,  including  changes  related  to  the  mix   of  rewards  redeemed,  to  estimate  future  redemption  costs.  We  continually  evaluate  our  reserve  and  assumptions  based  on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and\n\n81\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

To this end, we place the highest importance on human capital management; namely attracting, developing and retaining high caliber talent committed to our journey to becoming a top performing company and fostering an inclusive environment in which we actively seek and embrace diverse thinking.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately 36,600 employees based in approximately 50 countries, of which 48 percent are located in North America, 32 percent in the Asia Pacific region and the remaining 20 percent in the EMEA region and Latin America.\n\nWe believe that we foster a constructive and healthy work environment for our employees and colleagues. Some examples of key programs and initiatives that are designed to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits. Under the oversight of the Compensation and Management Resources Committee of our Board of Directors (CMRC), we seek to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance and provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve outstanding results.\n\nManagement and the CMRC engage the services of third-party compensation consultants and advisors to help us monitor the market competitiveness of our incentive programs. We provide a performance-driven compensation structure that consists of base salary and, for eligible employees, short- and long-term incentives. We also offer comprehensive benefits to support the health and wellness needs of our colleagues, including subsidized health care plans, life insurance and disability, wellness and mental health benefits, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, parental leave policies and matching 401(k) contributions and matching charitable donations, for eligible employees.\n\nHealth and Safety. AIG cares about the health and safety of its employees. Occupational safety and health is a shared responsibility between employees and corporate stakeholders, which we implement through our Global Safety and Environment policy. We take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, to provide a safe and healthy work environment, and to meet regulatory and duty of care responsibilities regarding the health, safety and welfare of employees engaging in AIG business activities. For example, in response to COVID-19 in 2020, we quickly and effectively transitioned 90 percent of our employees to remote work and established a cross-functional task force to ensure that AIG implemented best practices to protect the safety of colleagues while continuing to serve clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders. Where permitted by local laws and regulations, our offices are open to fully vaccinated employees, even so we have continued our work from home availability. Mask mandates, social distancing, and office capacity limits have been implemented to comply with local law. Additionally, we have strict quarantine and contact tracing protocols in place in the event a positive COVID-19 case occurs.\n\nNearly every country in which we operate has an Employee Assistance Program, which provides employees with mental health resources, including counseling sessions and webinars. We also funded a pandemic financial assistance program to provide financial assistance to employees in the form of low or no-interest loans. Further, in December 2020, we launched our Compassionate Colleagues Fund with an initial contribution of $2 million by AIG. The fund has helped more than 700 employees overcome serious financial hardships and disasters. Since then, voluntary employee donations together with company matches of these contributions have continued to grow the size of the fund designed to enable employees to help their fellow colleagues.\n\nTalent Development. AIG is committed to offering a multitude of learning and development opportunities for our colleagues. AIG has developed numerous programs to foster leadership, growth and development opportunities for our employees. We believe that professional development is a positive investment in our talent. Our goal is to build our employees' skills and fuel a culture of development, change agility, and transformational readiness across the Company through learning and development experiences. To support this, AIG provides colleagues with a centralized destination where they can access a personalized learning platform that includes a variety of programs to support employee growth. We have also developed a core, globally consistent curriculum that focuses on key skills that are important to our business and sets up colleagues for success in their career. In addition, we offer tuition, certification and training reimbursement programs to encourage employees to enhance their education, skills and knowledge for their continued growth.\n\nThe Company places significant importance and attention on promoting internal talent and succession planning. Accordingly, we review our talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and operating segments annually, to identify and develop a pipeline of diverse talent for positions at all levels of the organization. In 2021, we developed a globally consistent, streamlined process to encourage robust discussions around succession pipelines and the development of critical talent. In 2021, 28.3 percent of all our open positions were filled with internal talent.\n\n8 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

The BSA and USA PATRIOT Act include a variety of monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as currency transaction reporting and suspicious activity reporting), as well as identity verification and client due diligence requirements which are intended to detect, report and/or prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In addition, CSC and various subsidiaries of the Company are subject to U.S. sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nWe believe that hiring people who share our corporate purpose of helping clients achieve their financial goals is an essential element of executing our 'Through Clients' Eyes' strategy, and we seek to attract, retain, and motivate the talent Schwab needs to successfully serve our clients and grow our business. As of December 31, 2021, Schwab had full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, that represented the equivalent of approximately 33,400 full-time employees.\n\nSchwab offers a compensation package that rewards both employee and company performance. The package encompasses an array of compensation components in addition to base pay including performance-based incentive pay, equity awards, recognition awards, and a range of health and wellness benefits. We also offer benefits and resources designed to help our employees achieve their financial goals, including a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, financial planning consultations, and disability and life insurance options. In addition, Schwab offers programs to help with employee career growth including development and leadership programs as well as reimbursement for qualified business-related education and training. We also encourage and empower employees to volunteer in the communities where we live and work, offering paid time off for every employee to volunteer in his or her community.\n\nAs we move through the COVID-19 pandemic, we've created a Workplace Flexibility Program (WFP) to provide managers and employees with greater flexibility with remote work options. The WFP is designed to balance the importance our employees place on workplace flexibility with the benefit of in-person interactions to train and learn from one another, build human connections, and maintain Schwab's culture as we serve our clients.\n\nWe know that through workplace diversity, we gain a wider range of perspectives and experiences, which supports our strategy and helps us better serve our clients. We focus on attracting a diversity of talent by maintaining a strong employer brand and expanding where and how we meet prospective employees. We recruit from underrepresented communities through targeted campus recruiting, scholarship programs, and partnerships with professional organizations. We also offer coaching programs for college students from underrepresented communities to help develop career skills and learn about internship and career opportunities at Schwab. For Schwab employees, we support a number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) which are employee-driven and provide support, leadership development opportunities, and connection to our diverse marketplace. Our ERGs are made up of employees who share characteristics or life experiences and are committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion at Schwab. Additionally, our leaders are explicitly responsible for creating an environment where all people can do their best work, and for fostering the development of high-performance teams that recognize the value of diverse perspectives, skills and backgrounds. We regularly request feedback from our employees through surveys.\n\n## Available Information\n\nSchwab files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC filings are available to the public over the internet on the SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov.\n\nOn our website, https://www.aboutschwab.com, we post the following filings after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC: annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      "answer": "AIG optimizes capital efficiency by growing Institutional Markets' assets under management, particularly through pension risk transfer annuities, which are designed to match product design and high-quality investments with asset and liability exposures to support cash and liquidity needs under various scenarios. Additionally, AIG emphasizes underwriting innovations and cost efficiencies to enhance returns. Schwab, on the other hand, measures capital efficiency using return on tangible common equity, which excludes goodwill and acquired intangible assets to reflect the underlying operating performance. Schwab defines return on tangible common equity as annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity, aiming to assess returns relative to the composition of its balance sheet post-acquisitions.",

Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. | We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab's ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company's ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company's underlying operating performance. |\n| Return on tangible common equity                                                         | Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity.

These tolerances are at the highest level and guide risk management across the enterprise. In contrast, Schwab establishes risk metrics and tolerance levels for key risk categories through the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees, which are then reported to and approved by the Board Risk Committee. This shows that while AIG centralizes high-level risk thresholds at the board and CRO level, Schwab integrates risk metric oversight through a committee structure before board-level approval. Both institutions align risk governance with their strategic objectives but differ in the delegation and structuring of risk metric ownership and enforcement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AIG's 10-K, extract the detail that board-level risk tolerances define the minimum consolidated capital and liquidity levels and are approved by the Board and monitored by the RCC.",
        "Step 2: From Schwab's 10-K, extract that risk metrics with limits and tolerance levels are established by the Global Risk Committee and its sub-committees and then reported to the Board Risk Committee.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two governance models to compare how each firm structures its enterprise risk management around capital and liquidity metrics."

Framework objectives include:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nEstablishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nDefining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nAligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n\nTo support the monitoring and management of AIG's and its business units' material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nBoard-level risk tolerances are AIG's aggregate consolidated capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of consolidated capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances are approved by the Board of Directors and monitored by the RCC.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nAIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nBusiness unit and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.\n\nAll limits are reviewed by the GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n\nThe business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n\n## Risk Identification and Measurement\n\nWe conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. In addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n\nWe employ various approaches to measure, monitor and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks.\n\nThe internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n\nThe stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risks in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our noninsurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress, and includes multi-factor stresses as well as single factor sensitivities that are designed to reflect AIG's risk characteristics. We use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n\nWe evaluate and manage risk in material topics as shown below. These topics are discussed in further detail in the following pages:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nCredit Risk Management\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nLiquidity Risk Management\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nInsurance Risks\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nMarket Risk Management\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOperational Risk Management\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOther Business Risks\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 153",

Our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and taking action through various means. Though integration work continues, the Company's operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.\n\nWe designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Governance\n\nSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks.\n\nThe Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, and internal audit.\n\nFunctional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:\n\n- Operational Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;\n- Compliance Risk Committee - provides oversight of compliance risk management programs (inclusive of Anti-Money Laundering/Sanctions, Conduct, Fiduciary, and Privacy), policies, and risk tolerance levels providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;\n- Financial Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and\n- New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.\n\nSenior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company's finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.",

The impact of the ADC is shown beginning in 2016 given the retroactive date of the contract and coincides with the effective date of the contract. For the lines of business covered by the agreement (U.S. Workers' Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, U.S. Property and Special Risks and U.S. Personal Insurance or collectively, the Covered Lines), an attribution of the loss recoveries to the line of business by calendar year and accident year is performed based on the underlying distribution of the losses subject to the agreement. Specifically, the future claim payments for all subject incurred losses were projected into future years based on the same actuarial assumptions underlying the related reserves. The additional table presented after discussion of prior year development by line of business reconciles the changes in net ultimates to our overall prior year development and provides the reattribution of loss recoveries for the Covered Lines. The reinsurance terms of the ADC were then used to identify the future claims payments for which 80% will be reimbursed by NICO. At each reporting period, the attribution of the ADC recoveries is performed. The factors that could cause the attribution to lines of business and accident year to change include changes in underlying actuarial assumptions as to timing and amount of future claim payments.\n\nIncurred but not reported liabilities (IBNR): We include development from past reported losses in IBNR.\n\nData excluded from tables: Information with respect to accident years older than ten years is excluded from the development tables. Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are also excluded.\n\nForeign exchange: The loss development for operations outside of the U.S. is presented for all accident years using the current exchange rate at December 31, 2021. Although this approach requires restating all prior accident year information, the changes in exchange rates do not impact incurred and paid loss development trends.\n\nAcquisitions: We include acquisitions from all accident years presented in the tables. For purposes of this disclosure, we have applied the retrospective method for the acquired reserves, including incurred and paid claim development histories throughout the relevant tables. It should be noted that historical reserves for the acquired businesses were established by the acquired companies using methods, assumptions and procedures then in effect which may differ from our current reserving bases. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on the aggregated historical results shown in the triangles.\n\nDispositions: We exclude dispositions from all accident years presented in the tables.\n\nClaim counts: We consider a reported claim to be one claim for each claimant or feature for each loss occurrence. Claims relating to losses that are 100 percent reinsured are excluded from the reported claims in the tables below. Reported claims for losses from assumed reinsurance contracts are not available and hence not included in the reported claims.\n\nThere are limitations that should be considered on the reported claim count data in the tables below, including:\n\n- -Claim counts are presented only on a reported (not an ultimate) basis;\n- -The tables below include lines of business and geographies at a certain aggregated level which may indicate different frequency and severity trends and characteristics, and may not be as meaningful as the claim count information related to the individual products within those lines of business and geographies;\n- -Certain lines of business are more likely to be subject to occurrences involving multiple claimants and features, which can distort measures based on the reported claim counts in the table below; and\n- -Reported claim counts are not adjusted for ceded reinsurance, which may distort the measure of frequency or severity.\n\nSupplemental Information: The information about incurred and paid loss development for all periods preceding the year ended December 31, 2021 and the related historical claims payout percentage disclosure is unaudited and is presented as supplementary information.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 255",

      "question": "How does MET's use of consumer credit scores in determining ACL for residential mortgage loans relate to PYPL's reliance on credit scores for assessing the creditworthiness of consumers using their credit products, and what is the combined financial risk exposure if both companies experience a rise in low credit score borrowers?",
      "answer": "MET uses consumer credit scores as a key risk profile factor when pooling residential mortgage loans and applying estimated lifetime loss rates to determine ACL, which directly affects their financial exposure to defaults. PYPL relies on credit scores as part of proprietary risk models to assess the creditworthiness of consumers using their credit products, which influences the likelihood of default and subsequent financial impact on PYPL. If both companies experience a rise in borrowers with low credit scores, MET would likely increase ACL based on historical default rates tied to lower credit scores, while PYPL would face higher default rates and potential charge-offs, both leading to increased financial risk and reduced profitability.",

      "answer": "MetLife records changes in the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives directly in net derivative gains (losses), which can significantly affect net income due to fluctuations in credit spreads, interest rates, and market volatility. In contrast, PayPal holds derivatives primarily for hedging foreign exchange risk and initially records gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MetLife records changes in fair value of embedded derivatives (e.g., equity-indexed annuities and reinsurance-related derivatives) directly in net derivative gains (losses), which can materially affect net income due to market factors like credit spreads, interest rates, and volatility.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - PayPal reports $57 million of net derivative losses in AOCI as of December 31, 2023, which are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as the hedged transactions occur.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies hold derivatives, MetLife\u2019s derivative valuation directly impacts current earnings, whereas PayPal\u2019s impact is deferred through AOCI, showing different timing and mechanisms of earnings influence."

      "answer": "Both PYPL and V disclose that strategic transactions could result in the incurrence of significant additional debt, which could negatively impact their financial positions. PYPL specifically mentions that acquisitions may lead to dilutive issuances of equity securities or significant additional debt, which could harm their business and financial condition. Similarly, V highlights that strategic transactions may involve the incurrence of debt, negatively affecting their financial position and operations. These disclosures reflect a shared concern that increased debt from strategic activities could strain liquidity, increase financial risk, and potentially harm their overall financial health.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - PYPL mentions that acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of significant additional debt, which could harm their business, results of operations, and financial condition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - V discloses that strategic transactions may involve the incurrence of debt, which could negatively impact their financial position and operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies explicitly identify the incurrence of debt as a risk factor related to strategic transactions. This shared disclosure highlights a common financial risk: increased debt from such activities could impair liquidity, elevate financial leverage, and adversely affect their financial conditions."

V reported that higher incentive payments negatively impacted cash flow from operations in fiscal 2024, although no exact dollar amount was disclosed. Therefore, while we can quantify PYPL's sensitivity to tax rate changes, the exact financial impact on V from incentive payments remains unspecified.",

        "Step 2: Extract from source B - V_10k_2023.pdf:page_48:chunk_3: 'Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher incentive payments and higher cash paid for taxes due to the timing of payments, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The question compares the financial sensitivity of two companies to different business drivers: PYPL's income tax expense sensitivity to tax rate changes and V's cash flow from operations sensitivity to incentive payments. Both companies disclose impacts related to incentive payments or tax-related metrics, but only PYPL provides a quantified sensitivity."

      "answer": "PayPal's disclosure highlights $80 million in uncommitted credit facilities available for general corporate purposes, with no specific details on future principal payments or a defined time horizon for repayment. In contrast, Visa provides a structured schedule of future principal payments totaling $21,111 million, with defined amounts extending through 2029 and a 'Thereafter' category of $11,728 million. This difference reflects PayPal's flexible, on-demand approach to credit access without binding repayment commitments, versus Visa's transparent, long-term debt management strategy with clear repayment obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A (PayPal) - PayPal maintains uncommitted credit facilities of approximately $80 million as of December 31, 2023, which can be withdrawn at its discretion for general corporate purposes, with no specific end date or repayment schedule disclosed.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B (Visa) - Visa provides a detailed schedule of future principal payments totaling $21,111 million, with specific amounts allocated through 2029 and a final 'Thereafter' category of $11,728 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrasting formats reveal different debt management philosophies: PayPal opts for flexibility and discretion without binding repayment timelines, while Visa commits to a structured, transparent repayment plan with defined obligations."

      "question": "How do Goldman Sachs' 2024 expense savings initiatives and Charles Schwab's interest expense dynamics in a fluctuating interest rate environment reflect their respective strategies to manage financial performance amid changing market conditions?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs emphasized its 2024 expense savings initiatives as a key component of achieving its target return on equity (ROE), return on tangible equity (ROTE), and efficiency ratio. These initiatives are tied to reducing operational costs and growing businesses with more durable revenues, although they are subject to risks such as delays in implementation or increased competition. On the other hand, Charles Schwab's interest expense dynamics in 2024 reflect its asset-liability management strategies in response to simulated interest rate changes. Schwab's hedging of fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes with interest rate swaps resulted in higher interest expense in a rising rate environment, while lower cash balances and a decreased allocation to shorter-term liabilities influenced interest expense savings in a lower rate environment. Together, these strategies highlight how both firms are adapting to market volatility through cost optimization and interest rate risk management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Goldman Sachs explicitly mentions its 2024 expense savings initiatives as part of its strategy to achieve target ROE, ROTE, and improve the efficiency ratio, with risks including delays in implementation and increased competition.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Charles Schwab discusses the impact of simulated interest rate changes on net interest revenue, noting that hedging fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes with interest rate swaps led to higher interest expense in a rising rate environment, while lower cash balances and a decreased allocation to shorter-term liabilities reduced interest expense savings in a lower rate environment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both firms are managing financial performance through distinct strategies: Goldman Sachs focuses on expense savings to meet efficiency and return targets, while Schwab uses hedging and liability management to navigate interest rate volatility. These approaches reflect their respective risk management and operational strategies in a dynamic market."

The Company's simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower non-maturity deposit rates and a decreased allocation to shorter-term liabilities, both of which reduce interest expense savings in a lower rate environment, partially offset by interest expense savings from hedging fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes.\n\n## Effective Duration\n\nEffective duration measures price sensitivity relative to a change in prevailing interest rates, taking account of amortizing cash flows and prepayment optionality for mortgage-related securities and loans. Duration is measured in years and commonly interpreted as the average timing of principal and interest cash flows. We seek to manage the Company's asset duration in relation to management's estimate of the Company's liability duration. The Company's liability duration is impacted by the composition of funding sources, and typically decreases in periods of rising market interest rates and increases in periods of declining market interest rates. The Company also utilizes derivative hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps in managing its asset and liability duration.\n\nThe following table presents the Company's estimated effective durations, which reflects anticipated future payments, by category:\n\n",

      "answer": "Schwab hedges its fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes with receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps, which result in higher interest expense in a rising interest rate environment. This contrasts with Goldman Sachs' disclosures that their interest expense savings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates and competition from similar products, indicating that GS's savings could be materially different than anticipated depending on market conditions. Therefore, while Schwab's hedging increases interest expense in a rising rate scenario, Goldman Sachs expresses uncertainty about the realization of projected interest expense savings due to external factors like interest rate changes.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_b, Schwab hedges fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes using receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps, which lead to higher interest expense in a rising rate environment.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_a, Goldman Sachs discloses that statements about interest expense savings are subject to the risk that actual savings may differ materially due to changes in interest rates and competition from other products.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize that Schwab actively manages interest rate exposure through hedging, which has a direct and stated effect on interest expense, while Goldman Sachs highlights exposure to interest rate volatility as a risk to achieving projected savings."

The Company's simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower non-maturity deposit rates and a decreased allocation to shorter-term liabilities, both of which reduce interest expense savings in a lower rate environment, partially offset by interest expense savings from hedging fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes.\n\n## Effective Duration\n\nEffective duration measures price sensitivity relative to a change in prevailing interest rates, taking account of amortizing cash flows and prepayment optionality for mortgage-related securities and loans. Duration is measured in years and commonly interpreted as the average timing of principal and interest cash flows. We seek to manage the Company's asset duration in relation to management's estimate of the Company's liability duration. The Company's liability duration is impacted by the composition of funding sources, and typically decreases in periods of rising market interest rates and increases in periods of declining market interest rates. The Company also utilizes derivative hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps in managing its asset and liability duration.\n\nThe following table presents the Company's estimated effective durations, which reflects anticipated future payments, by category:\n\n",

      "answer": "American Express attributes gross unrealized losses on its available-for-sale debt securities primarily to increases in current benchmark interest rates and concludes there was no credit loss, expecting full recovery of contractual principal and interest. MetLife, on the other hand, emphasizes that future credit loss provisions will depend on economic fundamentals, issuer performance, changes in credit ratings, and collateral valuation. These differences suggest that while American Express focuses on interest rate risk as a temporary factor, MetLife accounts for broader credit risk dynamics that could lead to more variable credit loss provisions.",

In contrast, AXP's disclosures focus on the methodology for reporting changes in asset distribution, breaking them into components such as the change in volume multiplied by the prior year rate, and the change in rate multiplied by both prior year volume and change in volume.

      "answer": "The difference in timing between when Capital One recognized its $130 million goodwill increase from acquisitions in 2020 and when Mastercard finalized its purchase accounting in 2021 suggests that Mastercard required additional time to complete valuation processes for its 2020 acquisitions, whereas Capital One had already completed its accounting for acquisitions within the same year.

These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities.\n\nFor  unused  credit  card  lines,  we  have  not  experienced  and  do  not  anticipate  that  all  of  our  customers  will  access  their  entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain  certain  credit  standards.  Collateral  requirements  and  loan-to-value  ('LTV')  ratios  are  the  same  as  those  for  funded transactions and are established based on management's credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements.\n\nWe  also  issue  letters  of  credit,  such  as  financial  standby,  performance  standby  and  commercial  letters  of  credit,  to  meet  the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of  a  customer  to  a  third  party  in  a  borrowing  arrangement.  Commercial  letters  of  credit  are  short-term  commitments  issued primarily  to  facilitate  trade  finance  activities  for  customers  and  are  generally  collateralized  by  the  goods  being  shipped  to  the customer. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management's credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\nThe following table presents the contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments.\n\n## Table 18.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n\n",

We  consider  various  factors  in  estimating  customer performance,  including  forecasted  transactions,  card  issuance  and  card  conversion  volumes,  expected  payments  and  historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates primarily  when  volume-  and  transaction-  based  revenues  are  recognized  over  the  contractual  term.

In contrast, PayPal's 2024 financial statements focus on delinquency status and gross charge-offs for installment loans based on days past due, suggesting an ongoing exposure and active risk management process for these loans. This comparison reveals that while GS largely exited the installment loan space, PYPL continues to manage installment loan risk actively, requiring different approaches to financial risk assessment.",

      "answer": "MA reported a total amortized cost of $291 million in 2024, with only $1 million in gross unrealized gains and no losses, indicating a relatively conservative and stable investment strategy, mainly in government, corporate, and asset-backed securities. In contrast, MET reported a significantly higher total amortized cost of $89,812 million in 2024, with a more diversified mortgage loan portfolio across commercial, agricultural, and residential segments. MET's larger portfolio and lack of disclosed unrealized gains or losses suggest a more risk-tolerant, large-scale investment approach focused on mortgage lending rather than fixed-income securities. The stark difference in scale and asset focus highlights contrasting portfolio strategies: MA prioritizes stability with smaller, low-risk investments, while MET manages a much larger, diversified mortgage portfolio.",

These benefits are part of a broader focus on employee well-being and flexibility, including hybrid work arrangements and mental, physical, and financial health resources. MetLife (MET), on the other hand, offers competitive paid time off as part of its comprehensive benefits and wellbeing programs, which include tailored parental leave programs in all markets. Both companies emphasize employee well-being, but Mastercard's approach includes unique elements like volunteer days and dependent care support, while MetLife focuses on market-specific customization of paid time off and parental leave.",

In contrast, JPMorgan Chase reports financial figures for its Asset & Wealth Management segment across different time periods but does not disclose a specific geographic methodology for revenue attribution in this segment. This suggests that Goldman Sachs emphasizes sales team geography in revenue attribution, while JPMorgan Chase does not provide a comparable geographic breakdown for its Asset & Wealth Management revenues.",

      "answer": "GS reports that a one basis point increase in credit spreads (both counterparty and its own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives would result in a $2 million loss as of December 2024. In contrast, JPM evaluates its structural interest rate risk through earnings-at-risk simulations, which include interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, but does not explicitly quantify a dollar impact for a one basis point increase in credit spreads. Instead, JPM focuses on sensitivity analyses involving parallel shifts, steeper, and flatter yield curves, with assumptions around deposit betas, mortgage prepayments, and forecasted balance sheets. Therefore, while GS provides a direct financial quantification of $2 million, JPM does not specify a dollar amount for credit spread sensitivity but includes broader scenario-based interest rate sensitivities.",

Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure for a giv en interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitiv ity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitiv e fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitiv e assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies ('non-U.S. dollar' currencies). These simulations primarily include retained and held-for-sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing activ ities, inv estment securities, longterm debt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitiv ity-based measures as described on page 142. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange exposures arising from capital inv estments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 149 for more information.\n\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a baseline ov er the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift inv olv ing changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curv e inv olv ing holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curv e inv olv ing increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\n\n- The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n- Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinv estment behav ior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserv e's balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitativ e tightening and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that\n- require management judgment. The amount of deposits that the Firm holds at any giv en time may be influenced by Federal Reserv e actions, as well as broader monetary conditions and competition for deposits.\n- The pricing sensitiv ity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a giv en change in market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behav ior and competition for deposits.\n\nThe Firm performs sensitiv ity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitiv ity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically ev aluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improv ements in the Firm's simulation and other factors. In the second quarter of 2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid assumptions which take into account observed pricing and client and customer behav ior during the most recent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, resulting in an increase in positiv e sensitiv ity in higher interest rate scenarios, and an increase in negativ e sensitiv ity in lower interest rate scenarios.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk sensitiv ities are measures of the Firm's interest rate exposure. The Firm's actual net interest income for the rate changes presented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or customers in response to rate changes. Other significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. The Firm's forecast for net interest income is included in the Firm's outlook on page 57.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs (GS) must maintain a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) of 3.0% to meet its regulatory requirements, while Wells Fargo (WFC) must maintain a higher SLR of 6.0% to be classified as 'Well-capitalized.' This means WFC must hold twice the amount of Tier 1 capital relative to its total leverage exposure compared to GS, resulting in a stricter compliance threshold for WFC under the same regulatory framework.",

        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, Goldman Sachs (GS) is required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% and an SLR of 3.0% as of December 2024 to meet regulatory requirements.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, Wells Fargo (WFC) must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% and a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) of 6.0% to be classified as 'Well-capitalized.'",
        "Step 3: The comparison shows that WFC faces a stricter SLR requirement (6.0%) than GS (3.0%), indicating a higher capital buffer relative to total leverage exposure is required for WFC to remain compliant."

          "chunk_text": "acquiring companies engaged in financial activities without prior FRB approval. If the FHC fails to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order the FHC to divest any of its banking subsidiaries or, in the alternativ e, to cease engaging in financial activ ities.\n\nInterstate Banking .  A  BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company's initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks are also authorized to merge across state lines, subject to the same deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states. Regulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United States banking system.\n\n## Holding Company Structure\n\nTransfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called 'cov ered transactions.' In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving the transfer of v alue from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus. A lso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be secured by qualifying collateral. A  bank's transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms. The Parent's subsidiary banks are also subject to lending limits and qualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks.\n\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.\n\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent's stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.\n\nDepositor Preference. In the ev ent of the 'liquidation or other resolution' of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely payable at such insured depository institution's non-U.S. offices.\n\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company's subsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI A ct), insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same BHC. 'Default' means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 'In danger of default' means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.\n\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important firms . The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability  of the United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. Furthermore, to promote a BHC's safety and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and risk management standards for large national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activ ities. The guidelines also formaliz e roles and responsibilities for risk management practices within covered banks and create certain risk oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors.\n\n## Regulatory Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Requirements\n\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. The capital rules implement Basel III risk-based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations and, among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well as a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. In addition, the Company is required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt, often",
