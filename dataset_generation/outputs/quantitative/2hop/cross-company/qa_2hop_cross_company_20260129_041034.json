          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments\n\nWe also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars, and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Normal Purchase Normal Sale\n\nWe enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fix ed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect will result in physical delivery and utilization in the ordinary course of business in a reasonable period of time. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5, Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments.\n\n## Receivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOur receivables are mainly generated from product and equipment sales to, and royalties from, our licensees, as well as from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information, and outside credit monitoring. These indicators are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical ex perience, current market conditions, and reasonable forecasts. For the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was $21.2 million and $23.8 million, respectively.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience, and application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, inventory reserves were $58.0 million and $44.4 million, respectively.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use or to develop or obtain internal-use software, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment, 30 to 40 years for buildings, and 2 to 8 years for capitalized software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, ex cluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to ex ercise a renewal option imposes a significant economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. Capitalized software includes the costs of developing or obtaining internal-use software, such as external direct costs of materials and services, payroll and benefits costs, interest costs, and costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of historical data by new systems. We capitalize costs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management has authorized and committed to funding the software project, it is probable that the software project will be completed, and it is probable that the software will be used to perform the intended function.\n\nThe portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying",

      "answer": "The combined net cash used in investing activities for AMZN and BKNG in 2023 is $48,333 million. AMZN used $49,833 million in net cash for investing activities, reflecting a significant investment in capital expenditures and asset purchases to support its infrastructure and operations. In contrast, BKNG generated $1,500 million in net cash from investing activities, primarily from proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments, indicating a more conservative or divestiture-oriented capital allocation strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From AMZN's 2023 10-K filing, net cash used in investing activities is explicitly stated as $49,833 million.",
        "Step 2: From BKNG's 2023 10-K filing, net cash provided by investing activities is stated as $1,500 million, primarily from proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.",
        "Step 3: To determine the combined net cash used in investing activities, we subtract BKNG's positive cash flow from AMZN's negative cash flow: $49,833 million (AMZN) - $1,500 million (BKNG) = $48,333 million net cash used.",
        "Step 4: The contrast in their cash flows from investing activities reveals different capital allocation strategies\u2014AMZN is heavily investing in its infrastructure, while BKNG is generating cash through investment sales."

      "answer": "Both AMZN and BKNG rely on third-party processors for payment services and are subject to interchange fees, which directly affect their payment processing costs. AMZN states that interchange fees may increase over time, raising operating costs and lowering profitability. Similarly, BKNG notes that if interchange fees increase for any reason, their profit margin, business, and results of operations could be harmed. Therefore, any increase in interchange fees would have a compounding negative impact on both companies' financial performance due to their dependence on external payment processors.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - AMZN mentions that interchange fees may increase over time, raising operating costs and lowering profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - BKNG states that if interchange fees increase, their profit margin, business, and results of operations could be harmed.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies rely on third-party processors and are exposed to interchange fees; therefore, fee increases would negatively impact both companies' payment processing costs and profitability."

The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

      "answer": "HD reports its 2022 operating lease liabilities at a present value of $6,183 million after subtracting $912 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $7,095 million. In contrast, Tesla does not disclose a present value for its operating leases and instead reports gross lease receivables of $4,577 million. This difference in disclosure limits the comparability of their lease obligations because HD's figure reflects the time value of money, while Tesla's gross amount does not, making direct financial comparisons between the two companies less meaningful without further adjustments.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HD discloses the present value of its 2022 operating lease liabilities as $6,183 million, after subtracting $912 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $7,095 million.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla discloses gross lease receivables for operating leases as $4,577 million but does not provide a present value figure or imputed interest.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in accounting presentation (present value vs. gross receivables without interest breakout) affects the ability to directly compare the true economic value of lease obligations between HD and Tesla."

However, this also led to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense due to higher effective interest rates on debt. Meanwhile, Starbucks reported that changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rates affected $350 million of its August 2029 notes, which were hedged using interest rate swaps. Therefore, while GM benefited from higher interest rates on income-generating assets, it faced higher financing costs, and SBUX actively managed interest rate exposure through hedging instruments.",

      "answer": "NIKE's comparable store sales growth of 13% in the SOCO region contributed positively to its overall revenue performance, with NIKE Direct revenues increasing by 30% and digital sales growing by 51%. This growth was driven by improved physical retail traffic and higher average selling prices, despite store closures. In contrast, Starbucks experienced a 9% decline in comparable store sales, which negatively impacted its revenues by $459 million, primarily due to reduced customer transactions and average ticket decreases linked to pandemic-related restrictions in China. The divergence in performance highlights how comparable store sales can significantly influence revenue outcomes in opposite directions depending on regional and operational conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - NIKE's comparable store sales grew by 13%, contributing to a 30% increase in NIKE Direct revenues.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Starbucks experienced a 9% decline in comparable store sales, negatively impacting revenues by $459 million.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The contrasting impacts of comparable store sales growth (NIKE) versus decline (Starbucks) demonstrate how this metric directly influences revenue performance, especially when regional factors like pandemic restrictions (China) and market transitions (SOCO) are at play."

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we signed separate definitive agreements to sell our legal entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as our legal entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of our legal entities in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay will remain classified as heldfor-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The impacts of closing the Brazil transaction as well as classifying the Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay entities as held-for-sale in fiscal 2020 are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results. For more information see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2022. The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories, driven by SOCO (which comprises Argentina, Chile and Uruguay), Mexico and Korea, which increased 58%, 35% and 16%, respectively. Revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues increased 30%, primarily due to digital sales growth of 51% and comparable store sales growth of 13%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, partially offset by store closures.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2022 in part due to higher revenues in Women's and Men's. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 15 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher NIKE Direct ASP, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, higher off-price ASP and a higher mix of fullprice sales. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 3%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 9 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven by higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct and off-price ASPs. Higher ASPs, in part, reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.\n\nReported EBIT increased 24% for fiscal 2022, as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 400 basis points primarily due to higher margins and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP largely due to lower discounts, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower other costs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to lower warehousing costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand. The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in NIKE Direct variable expenses as well as higher bad debt expense.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 40",

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 600 basis points to 12.0%, primarily due to sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic impacts in our China market (approximately 460 basis points), investments and growth in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points), lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 100 basis points), higher commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures (approximately 90 basis points) and strategic initiatives (approximately 90 basis points).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## General\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, and fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks; comparable store sale percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week.\n\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&amp;A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n- New store openings and store count\n- Comparable store sales\n- Operating margin\n\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\n\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers.\n\nFor the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market.\n\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift.\n\nDespite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.",

Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

Also contributing to these increases were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($628 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($487 million), primarily due to business recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($427 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nNorth America operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 5% to $4.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 19.2%, primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 350 basis points).

This decline was a key factor in Starbucks' international operating income dropping 33% to $833.2 million.

Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021.

      "answer": "Both Amazon and General Motors recognized government incentives as reductions to expenses or capital investments in their 2023 financial statements. Amazon disclosed that government incentives related to transactions are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions. General Motors specifically reported recognizing $251 million in Automotive and other cost of sales associated with government incentives in 2023. This amount represents the benefit from incentives that were recorded as a reduction of expenses in the period when the related costs were incurred.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon recognizes government incentives as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - General Motors recognized $251 million in Automotive and other cost of sales associated with government incentives in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies account for government incentives similarly, but only General Motors provided a specific dollar amount ($251 million) for incentives recognized as a reduction to expenses in 2023."

      "answer": "Amazon actively works to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs by improving process efficiencies and maintaining a lean culture, as it seeks to scale its operations efficiently. In contrast, General Motors faces challenges due to its high proportion of fixed costs, which stem from significant investments in property, plant, and equipment, as well as constraints from collective bargaining agreements that limit flexibility in adjusting personnel costs. This difference highlights how Amazon's scalable and efficiency-driven model contrasts with GM's capital-intensive and labor-constrained automotive manufacturing model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon seeks to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs by improving process efficiencies and maintaining a lean culture.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - GM has a high proportion of fixed costs due to significant investment in property, plant, equipment, and limitations from collective bargaining agreements.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon's strategy focuses on controlling fixed costs to support scalable growth, whereas GM's fixed cost structure creates inflexibility and risk, especially when demand fluctuates."

      "question": "How did the increase in home improvement spending during the pandemic, as mentioned by both Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), influence their respective sales expectations as the pandemic began to subside?",
      "answer": "Both Home Depot and Lowe's reported an increase in home improvement spending during the pandemic, which positively impacted their sales. However, as the pandemic began to subside, both companies expressed concerns that customers may shift their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas such as travel and entertainment, which could have an adverse impact on their future sales.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from HD_10k_2022.pdf - Home Depot noted an 'increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic' and warned that as the pandemic subsides, customers may shift spending back to other areas, which 'may have an adverse impact on our sales.'",
        "Step 2: Extract from LOW_10k_2022.pdf - Lowe's also observed an 'increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic' and similarly cautioned that as the pandemic subsides, a shift in customer spending could 'have an adverse impact on our sales.'",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies experienced a sales boost due to increased home improvement spending during the pandemic. However, both expressed concern that as the pandemic waned, this spending trend would reverse, leading to a potential decline in sales."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- the impact of regulatory and judicial changes in liability for workers' compensation;\n- potential increases in insurance premiums, medical claims costs, and workers' compensation claim costs;\n- the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19;\n- the impact of litigation or claims from customers, associates, suppliers, regulators or other third parties relating to COVID-19 or our actions in response thereto;\n- the pace and extent of recovery as the pandemic subsides; and\n- the long-term impact of the pandemic on our business even after the pandemic subsides.\n\nIn addition, we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic. As the pandemic subsides, customers may shift more of their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, which may have an adverse impact on our sales.\n\nThe above factors and uncertainties, or others of which we are not currently aware, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition to the factors above, the COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business to a number of risks, including, but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in these Risk Factors:\n\nAssociate and Customer Safety-Related Risks . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a number of actions across our business to help protect our associates, customers, and others in the communities we serve. These measures included, among other things, increased cleaning and sanitizing measures; physical and social distancing efforts; continuing curbside pickup from stores; and modification of certain annual merchandising events. In certain jurisdictions, we temporarily ceased sales or delayed commencement of certain in-home services deemed nonessential early in the pandemic, and we may have to do so again or in other jurisdictions. Several of these actions adversely impacted our sales, and they may continue to do so going forward. We also took other steps to support our associates, including expanding certain compensation and benefits to help alleviate some of the challenges our associates were facing as a result of COVID-19. While we have transitioned from many of these temporary pay and benefits programs, the actions that we have taken in response to the pandemic resulted in significant incremental costs, and we expect that we will continue to incur additional costs due to the pandemic going forward, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nThe health and safety of our associates and customers are of primary concern to our management team. However, due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the consequences of our actions, we may see unexpected outcomes from our added safety measures or from rolling back safety measures as conditions evolve. For example, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if our customers or associates do not participate in social distancing, vaccination efforts, and other safety measures, or if rolling back safety measures results in additional outbreaks, the well-being of our associates and customers could be at risk. Furthermore, any failure to appropriately respond, or the perception of an inadequate response, could cause reputational harm to our brand and/or subject us to claims and litigation from associates, customers, suppliers, regulators or other third parties. Additionally, we have faced, and may continue to face, periodic labor shortages at our stores and facilities due to COVID-19, which can result in modifications to our operations including temporary closures and negatively impact our business, costs and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers' compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures. These actions may increase our exposure to workers' compensation claims and increase our cost of insurance.\n\nInformation Technology-Related Risks . As a result of the pandemic and related quarantines, shut-down orders, and similar restrictions, we have experienced increased demand for online purchases of products. While we have managed this increased volume to date without interruption, there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to do so. We have also had to rapidly modify certain technology systems to support our interconnected offerings in connection with the pandemic, such as the addition of curbside pickup. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems, either due to increased volume, system modifications, or other factors, could impair the benefits they provide, adversely impact our sales, and negatively affect our relationship with our customers. In addition, as more business activities have shifted online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face an increased risk due to the potential failure of internal or external information technology infrastructure as well as increased cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks.\n\nSupply Chain-Related Risks . Circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on business activities and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic",

We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and other various benefits. Our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, may materially reduce our earnings. Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions. We may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions, we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture, and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction. Further, we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt, which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future.\n\nOperating internationally presents unique challenges, including some that have required us to adapt our store operations, merchandising, marketing, and distribution functions to serve customers in Canada. Our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges.\n\nWe operate stores in Canada. Expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion. Our future operating results in Canada or in other countries or regions in which we may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including unfavorable political or economic factors, adverse tax consequences, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties of managing international operations, challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture, laws and regulations. These factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory and Other External Risks\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on us in 2020 and 2021, affecting our business operations, demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial condition, among other things. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the continuing effects of the pandemic, including the possible recurrence of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, 'shelter-in-place' orders, and various other restrictive measures.\n\nIn addition, we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic, as customers have focused on their homes and have spent less on other items like travel and entertainment. As the pandemic begins to subside, customers may shift their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, which may have an adverse impact on our sales.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including among others:\n\n- the duration and scope of the pandemic and associated disruptions, including whether there are additional 'waves' or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future variants or related strains of the virus in areas where we or our suppliers operate;",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2021, HD experienced a -0.1% change in comparable customer transactions, which had a neutral-to-slightly-negative impact on its 11.4% comparable sales growth, primarily driven by a 11.7% increase in average ticket. In contrast, LOW saw a 4.2% decline in comparable customer transactions, which partially offset its 11.1% increase in comparable average ticket and contributed to a 6.9% comparable sales growth. This shows that while both companies benefited from higher average ticket amounts, HD maintained relatively stable transaction volumes, whereas LOW faced a more significant drop in customer transactions.",

According to HD's definition, this adjustment is calculated as operating income multiplied by the effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. This adjustment reduces NKE's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $6,195 million to $5,065 million, reflecting earnings after the tax impact.",

      "answer": "HD has a commercial paper program allowing for $5.0 billion in borrowings, backed by a $3.5 billion five-year credit facility and a $1.5 billion 364-day credit facility. NKE has a $2 billion five-year credit facility (extendable to $3 billion) and a $1 billion 364-day credit facility (extendable to $1.5 billion). Since neither company has any outstanding borrowings, their combined available borrowing capacity is $10.5 billion. This significant liquidity positions both HD and NKE to act aggressively in pursuing strategic opportunities like acquisitions or scaling operations without immediate pressure to draw on these funds. In the Consumer Discretionary sector, where demand can be volatile and competitive positioning is crucial, this level of unused capacity may exceed industry norms and provides both firms with greater financial flexibility than peers who may carry more debt.",

        "Step 4: Sum the total borrowing capacity: $5.0 billion (HD) + $3.0 billion (NKE base) = $8.0 billion minimum, or up to $10.5 billion if both companies receive lender approval to increase limits.",
        "Step 5: Connect this to financial flexibility in the Consumer Discretionary sector, where access to capital can enable companies to act quickly on strategic opportunities while maintaining strong credit ratings."

      "answer": "Nike experienced a gross margin expansion of 220 basis points, partly due to lower ocean freight and logistics costs, which reduced overall product costs. In contrast, Home Depot noted that rising shipping costs, exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts and trade tensions, contributed to commodity price inflation, which could negatively impact their profit margins if they are unable to pass these costs onto consumers. This shows that while Nike benefited from declining shipping costs, Home Depot faced challenges from increasing shipping-related commodity costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Home Depot's 2023 10-K mentions that increases in shipping costs (linked to geopolitical conflicts and trade tensions) have contributed to commodity price inflation, which could negatively impact their profit margins.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Nike's 2023 10-K reports that lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs contributed to a gross margin expansion of 220 basis points.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Nike benefited from lower shipping costs, which reduced product costs and improved gross margins, while Home Depot faced the opposite risk: rising shipping costs feeding into commodity inflation, which threatens to squeeze profit margins unless prices are adjusted."

General Motors reports its ROIC-adjusted as based on EBIT-adjusted over average net assets, which includes adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets. This reflects GM\u2019s capital-intensive automotive business and significant liabilities. Nike reports its ROIC as 46.5%, calculated using Total NIKE Brand EBIT and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, focusing on operational efficiency and profitability without specific liability adjustments, aligning with its asset-light, brand-driven model.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted EPS-diluted-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  consolidated diluted  EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares  outstanding-diluted.  Examples  of  income  tax  adjustments  include  the  establishment  or  reversal  of  significant  deferred  tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted ETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our  core  operations  on  a  consistent  basis.  ETR-adjusted  is  calculated  as  Income  tax  expense  less  the  income  tax  related  to  the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before  income  taxes  less  adjustments. When  we  provide  an  expected  adjusted  effective  tax  rate,  we  do  not  provide  an  expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our  investment  and  capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review  the  liquidity  of  our  automotive  operations  and  to  measure  and  monitor  our  performance  against  our  capital  allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted  automotive  free  cash  flow  as  automotive  operating  cash  flow  from  operations  less  capital  expenditures  adjusted  for management actions.  Management  actions  can  include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Risk Factors, within Part I, Item 1. Business.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 OVERVIEW\n\nIn fiscal 2022, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues of $46.7 billion, which increased 5% and 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by declines in Greater China. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 5% and 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, compared to fiscal 2021. NIKE Direct grew 14% and 15%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, driven by an increase of 18% in NIKE Brand Digital, as growth in North America, APLA and EMEA was partially offset by a decline in Greater China. Wholesale revenues declined 1% as declines in North America and Greater China were partially offset by growth in EMEA and APLA. Revenues for Converse increased 6% and 7%, on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, led by double-digit growth in our direct to consumer business, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues.\n\nIncome before income taxes remained flat for fiscal 2022, as higher revenues and gross margin expansion were offset by higher selling and administrative expense. NIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 120 basis points, led by margin expansion in our NIKE Direct business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges, partially offset by elevated freight and logistics costs and higher inventory obsolescence reserves primarily recognized in Greater China in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher Operating overhead and Demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher strategic technology investments as well as increases in wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs. This activity was partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs in the prior year related to our organizational realignment. For more information, see Note 21 - Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns and continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand. ROIC as of May 31, 2022 was 46.5% compared to 48.8% as of May 31, 2021. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into separate definitive agreements to sell our legal entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as our legal entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In future quarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted our local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected our ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, we deconsolidated our Russian legal entities, the net revenues of which were less than one percent of consolidated net Revenues for fiscal 2021. The deconsolidation of our Russian legal entities resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, we made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\nWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics which have led to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.\n\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2021.\n\n## USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, as well as EBIT Margin and ROIC, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP'). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated",

      "answer": "General Motors relies on historical trends in making forward-looking judgments about the success of its full-size SUVs and pickup trucks, the adoption of electric vehicles, and the competitive landscape of the automotive industry. NIKE, on the other hand, uses historical experience and assumptions to estimate critical accounting areas such as revenue recognition, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. Both companies acknowledge that if actual outcomes differ from these historical assumptions, it could materially affect their financial results \u2014 GM could see a deviation in projected vehicle sales or adoption rates, and NIKE could face misstated asset values or unexpected costs, potentially leading to financial underperformance or stock price volatility.",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.' The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.\n\nThere are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.\n\n## We may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\n\nOur Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided. Analysts' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 23",

      "answer": "HD experienced a 0.9% decrease in average ticket and a 1.0% decline in comparable customer transactions, contributing to a 1.8% drop in comparable sales.

This growth was partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales ($420 million) driven by a 5% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket, primarily due to annualization of pricing.\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nNorth America operating income for fiscal 2024 decreased 3% to $5.4 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Operating margin contracted 90 basis points to 19.8%, primarily due to investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 150 basis points), deleverage (approximately 150 basis points), and increased promotional activity (approximately 100 basis points), partially offset by pricing (approx imately 220 basis points) and in-store operational efficiencies (approx imately 150 basis points).",

      "answer": "The differences in segment reporting between HD and MCD significantly limit the ability to directly compare the contribution of their U.S. Segments to operating income. HD aggregates all three geographic segments (U.S., Canada, Mexico) into one reportable segment, which prevents analysts from isolating the U.S. Segment\u2019s specific operating income contribution. In contrast, MCD separately discloses operating income by segment, including the U.S., allowing for precise visibility into how much the U.S. Segment contributes to overall operating income. This lack of disaggregated U.S. data from HD versus the detailed U.S. reporting from MCD makes it impossible to directly benchmark the U.S. performance of each company against the other.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From HD's 10-K, we learn that the company aggregates its U.S., Canada, and Mexico segments into one reportable segment, preventing visibility into the individual performance of the U.S. Segment.",

      "question": "What was Amazon's total fulfillment expense in 2021, and based on Lowe's disclosures, what specific risk could a similar reliance on third-party vendors pose to a company's financial results?",
      "answer": "Amazon's total fulfillment expense in 2021 was $75,111 million. According to Lowe's disclosures, a company that relies on third-party vendors could face the risk that 'if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.' This means that a disruption in third-party vendor operations could lead to temporary business interruptions and negatively impact financial results.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Amazon's 2022 10-K filing, specifically in the table on page 25, chunk 2, the fulfillment expense for 2021 is listed as $75,111 million.",
        "Step 2: In Lowe's 2022 10-K filing, on page 15, chunk 1, the company discloses that reliance on third-party vendors could lead to business disruptions if those vendors are unable to perform or if they discontinue operations.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize the two pieces of information: Amazon incurs significant fulfillment expenses, which likely include third-party vendor costs, and Lowe's explicitly discloses the risk that such vendor dependencies could negatively impact business and financial results if vendors fail or cannot be replaced quickly."

We also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\nFailure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell. We also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business. Many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies. If these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.\n\nFailures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general contractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including certain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party installers. Our or our third-party installers' failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.\n\n## Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\n\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nOur efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. We also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology and content delivery. Such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors. Our systems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and irregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as, an erosion of customer confidence. Additionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption. Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nAs customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences. Access to the Internet from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. Our websites, including Lowes.com, are a sales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our in-store sales. Additionally, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise interact with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools. Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers' perceptions of Lowe's as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.\n\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor, or Company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information.",

      "question": "How do the inventory cost reduction mechanisms involving vendor agreements differ between Amazon (AMZN) and Lowe\u2019s (LOW), and what specific financial impact did Lowe\u2019s vendor funds have on its cost of sales in 2022?",
      "answer": "Amazon reduces its cost of inventory through vendor agreements that provide consideration for cooperative marketing, promotions, and volume rebates, which are treated as a reduction in the prices paid for goods and recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory. Lowe\u2019s similarly reduces its inventory cost through vendor funds earned under agreements tied to purchase volumes, early payments, or product promotions, which are also recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory and subsequently flow into cost of sales as the inventory is sold. In 2022, Lowe\u2019s noted that vendor funds were a key factor in managing inventory costs, though the exact dollar value of this reduction is not quantified in the excerpt. However, the impact on cost of sales would be realized as the related inventory is sold.",

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\n\n## Fulfillment\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments' fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.\n\n## Technology and Content\n\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing\n\nMarketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\n\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $11.0 billion, $10.9 billion, and $16.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n## General and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock",

In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory\n\n## Description\n\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During 2021, our reserve decreased approximately $14 million to $168 million as of January 28, 2022.\n\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During 2021, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $49 million to $414 million as of January 28, 2022, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories.\n\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\n\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 28, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventory - Vendor Funds - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company receives funds from its vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes and sales. In the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022, the Company purchased inventory from a significant number of vendors. Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.\n\nWe identified vendor funds as a critical audit matter because of the volume and varying terms of the individual vendor agreements. This required an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the vendor funds were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit",

For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see 'Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' below.\n\nNorth America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our North America sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021.\n\nInternational sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our International sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.",

Revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven by higher revenues in EMEA, North America and APLA, partially offset by lower revenues in Greater China. Higher revenues in EMEA and North America each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to NIKE, Inc. Revenues, and APLA contributed approximately 2 percentage points, while lower revenues in Greater China reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2022, driven by growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business. Unit sales of footwear decreased 3%, while higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct ASP, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 6% for fiscal 2022, driven primarily by growth in Men's. Unit sales of apparel remained flat, and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nOn a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 42% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39% for fiscal 2021. NIKE Brand Digital sales were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021. On a currencyneutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2022, driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 18%, comparable store sales growth of 10%, in part due to improved physical retail traffic, and the addition of new stores. Comparable store sales, which exclude NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2022 NIKE Brand revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by increases in Men's and the Jordan Brand, which grew 3% and 7%, respectively.",

      "question": "How does the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations differ in impact between AMZN and NKE, given that AMZN reported a $14.6 billion other income (expense), net in 2021 which included foreign currency effects, and NKE explicitly warned that FX volatility could significantly affect its financial results and margins?",
      "answer": "AMZN experienced foreign exchange rate impacts as part of its $14.6 billion other income (expense), net in 2021, indicating FX movements contributed to this income, positively affecting its financial results. In contrast, NKE explicitly warned that FX volatility could negatively impact its financial condition and margins, noting that a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces the U.S. Dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. This contrast shows that while FX rates contributed positively to AMZN\u2019s income, they posed a financial risk to NKE, potentially reducing its revenues and margins.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from AMZN's 2022 10-K - 'Other income (expense), net was $14.6 billion during 2021' and 'foreign currency' is listed as a component of this metric.",
        "Step 2: Extract from NKE's 2022 10-K - FX volatility is described as a risk that 'could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings' and specifically weakens foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, reducing the U.S. Dollar value of NKE's foreign sales.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While AMZN benefited from FX movements as part of its $14.6 billion other income in 2021, NKE faced potential adverse effects from FX volatility, particularly from a stronger U.S. Dollar, which could reduce its translated revenues and earnings."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Operating Expense (Income), Net\n\nOther operating expense (income), net was $(75) million and $62 million during 2020 and 2021, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020, offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.\n\n## Interest Income and Expense\n\nOur interest income was $555 million and $448 million during 2020 and 2021. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\n\nInterest expense was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.\n\nOur long-term lease liabilities were $52.6 billion and $67.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our long-term debt was $31.8 billion and $48.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Leases and Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net was $2.4 billion and $14.6 billion during 2020 and 2021. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a valuation gain of $11.8 billion from our equity securities of Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November 2021.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\n\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.9 billion and $4.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 - Income Taxes' for additional information.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.",

Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates including as a result of U.S. policy changes and the Russia and Ukraine conflict that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could also have an effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 12",

Amazon specifically notes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are among the factors that could significantly affect its effective tax rates. Nike states that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Amazon estimates volume rebates based on progress toward purchase thresholds and records a portion of the rebate as the threshold is approached, while Home Depot accrues volume rebates over the incentive period, which typically ends at the end of the calendar year, and recognizes them in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon evaluates the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds for volume rebates using past experience and current forecasts, and records a portion of the rebate as progress is made toward the threshold.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Home Depot accrues volume rebates over the incentive period, which generally concludes at the end of the calendar year, and recognizes the rebates in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies account for volume rebates, but Amazon's recognition is tied to progress toward purchase thresholds, while Home Depot's is based on the accrual over the incentive period and tied to inventory sale timing."

      "question": "How does the treatment of foreign income taxes differ between Amazon and Home Depot in terms of their accounting for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax and indefinite reinvestment assertions, and what specific accounting policy decisions reflect these differences?",
      "answer": "Amazon explicitly states that it intends to indefinitely reinvest its foreign subsidiary earnings outside the U.S. in jurisdictions where significant additional costs would be incurred upon repatriation. This indefinite reinvestment assertion means Amazon does not provide for deferred taxes on those foreign earnings. In contrast, Home Depot is subject to GILTI tax, an incremental tax on foreign income, and has made an accounting election to record this tax in the period it arises. This indicates that while Amazon avoids recognizing GILTI or similar taxes by asserting indefinite reinvestment, Home Depot recognizes GILTI tax liability in its financial statements as it arises, reflecting a different approach to foreign income taxation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Amazon intends to indefinitely reinvest foreign subsidiary earnings outside the U.S. in jurisdictions where repatriation would incur significant additional costs, and thus does not provide for deferred taxes on those earnings.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon avoids recognizing GILTI or similar taxes by asserting indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings, while Home Depot recognizes GILTI tax liability in its financial statements as it arises, indicating a divergence in foreign income tax treatment."

Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\n\n## We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\n\nWe are subject to a variety of tax es and tax  collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax  ex pense and be subject to additional tax  liabilities, including other liabilities for tax  collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For ex ample, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted tax es on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax  measures may continue unless broader international tax  reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\n\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax  reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\n\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special or ex traterritorial tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\n\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax  assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax  applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax  accruals.\n\n## We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\n\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\n\n## Item 1B.

These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax  laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign tax ing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax  positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate.

      "answer": "AMZN capitalized $19.6 billion in video and music content as of December 31, 2024, and amortizes these assets on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. This reflects a strategy of aligning amortization with expected consumer demand and monetization of content, particularly within Amazon Prime memberships. In contrast, TSLA amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to thirty years, indicating a more uniform approach to asset value recognition that does not vary with usage patterns. The differing methodologies suggest that AMZN's asset management strategy is more demand-sensitive and content-specific, while TSLA applies a standardized, time-based depreciation model consistent with broader industrial or infrastructure asset management.",

We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or ex penses.\n\n## Digital Video and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to 'Cost of sales' on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are ex pensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to 'Cost of sales' predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Such investments are included in 'Cash and cash equivalents' or 'Marketable securities' on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Ex pected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance through 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes reported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any associated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' to 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and are classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approx imately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this conversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and",

We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate.

These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $365 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax  assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax  assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Amazon would incur an additional $365 million in cost of sales for a 1% increase in inventory valuation allowance. Tesla also incurs inventory write-downs as part of its cost of revenue for both Automotive and Energy Generation and Storage segments, but it does not provide a specific sensitivity analysis or quantified impact for a percentage change in inventory valuation. Therefore, while Amazon explicitly discloses the financial impact of inventory write-downs, Tesla does not quantify this effect in its filings.",

        "Step 1: From Amazon's 10-K filing, it explicitly states that a 1% increase in inventory valuation allowance would result in an additional $365 million in cost of sales.",
        "Step 2: Tesla's 10-K filing confirms that inventory write-downs are included in the cost of revenue for both the Automotive and Energy Generation and Storage segments, but no specific numerical sensitivity or impact is disclosed.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both filings, Amazon provides a quantified sensitivity for inventory write-downs, while Tesla only describes the inclusion of such write-downs in cost of revenue without a specific measurable impact."

These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $365 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax  assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax  assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Automotive Leasing\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n## Services and Other\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to affect tax able income. V aluation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax  assets to the amount expected to be realized.",

What are the specific foreign rate differential impacts for each company in 2023, and how does this difference in reporting reflect contrasting approaches to disclosing international tax effects?",
      "answer": "In 2023, BKNG reported a $307 million foreign rate differential adjustment in its tax provision, while SBUX disclosed its foreign rate differential as 0.3% of the statutory tax rate. These differing disclosures reflect that BKNG quantifies its international tax rate differences in absolute dollar terms, likely emphasizing materiality in financial reporting, whereas SBUX integrates the impact as a relative percentage within its effective tax rate reconciliation, focusing on the proportional effect on overall tax expense.",

      "answer": "BKNG's financial results depend heavily on travel services, which fluctuate with consumer discretionary spending levels. Similarly, SBUX, as a retailer, is also dependent on consumer discretionary spending, making both companies vulnerable to economic downturns. During periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, consumers may reduce discretionary purchases, leading to decreased transaction growth rates and lower revenues for BKNG, while SBUX may experience reduced customer traffic and average value per transaction, both negatively impacting their financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - BKNG's revenues and results of operations are affected by consumer discretionary spending levels, as demand for travel services declines during adverse economic conditions.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SBUX's business is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions because it relies on consumer discretionary spending, which can lead to reduced customer traffic and average transaction value.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both BKNG and SBUX are exposed to the same economic factor (consumer discretionary spending), and during economic uncertainty, reduced consumer spending impacts their respective business models in similar ways, creating a shared vulnerability."

In contrast, SBUX earns revenue from license fees through its licensed store model, where it receives fees and royalties from partners, contributing to 12% of its total net revenues in fiscal 2024. While BKNG treats license fees as a cost center that reduces profitability, SBUX treats them as a revenue stream that enhances operating margins.",

In 2023, MCD paid $56.1 million in variable rent for company-operated restaurants and $261.4 million for franchised restaurants, directly tying lease costs to sales performance. In contrast, LOW disclosed that variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented, indicating minimal exposure to sales-linked lease costs.

In contrast, McDonald's disclosed the presentation of comparable sales and systemwide sales trends in tabular form but did not quantify specific drivers or positive impacts from digital or delivery channels on its comparable sales performance.

In contrast, MCD disclosed a 9.0% increase in global comparable sales for 2023, driven by strong performance across all segments, particularly the U.S. and International Operated markets, which supported its strategic initiative 'Accelerating the Arches.' This divergence in comparable sales performance highlights contrasting business outcomes: LOW experienced a contraction in sales and had to adjust for the removal of Canadian operations, while MCD successfully executed its growth strategy, leading to strong systemwide sales and improved financial metrics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Policies and E stimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ('GAAP'). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\n\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax , the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Automotive Sales\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ('ASC 606'), including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for ex cess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is writtendown, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.",

      "answer": "Lowe's Sales Return Reserve decreased from $191 million in 2024 to $167 million in 2025, indicating a reduction in the estimated liability for future product returns. Tesla recognizes a sales return reserve based on historical experience and expected future market values when offering resale value guarantees, particularly in connection with vehicle leasing programs transferred to commercial banking partners. This reserve directly affects Tesla's financial obligations by accounting for potential returns or buybacks under guaranteed resale terms. Together, both companies account for potential returns, but Tesla's reserve is more dynamic due to its vehicle resale guarantees, while Lowe's reflects a more stable historical trend. The combined impact shows how both firms estimate and manage obligations tied to customer return policies, albeit through different mechanisms and business models.",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for ex pected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are ex pensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.",

In contrast, TSLA includes sales tax as part of its taxes payable, indicating that it accounts for sales tax as a liability rather than netting it against revenue. This results in a difference in financial statement presentation regarding the treatment of sales tax between the two companies.",

        "Step 3: Comparing these two disclosures reveals a difference in financial statement treatment: LOW reduces revenue by the amount of sales tax, while TSLA includes sales tax in taxes payable without affecting revenue directly."

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach ('adoption of the new lease standard'). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\n\n## Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Fair Value Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. The Company enters into fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was effectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $1.5 billion, which included an increase of $4.8 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $31.0 million loss on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding gain on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover up to the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $1.3 billion that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows.\n\nBased on market conditions at December 31, 2021, the $24.8 million in cumulative cash flow hedging losses, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) as well as foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2021, $12.4 billion of the Company's third party foreign currency denominated debt, $1.4 billion of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $477 million of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Derivatives\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. As an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company has also used certain derivatives to mitigate the share price risk related to its sale of stock in McDonald's Japan. The changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivatives used for the most recent sale transaction were recognized immediately in earnings in Other operating (income) expense, net. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2021 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 58 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach ('adoption of the new lease standard'). In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs\n\nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income ('GILTI') earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.\n\n## Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan (the 'ESPP') to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.",

      "question": "How did rising commodity costs in 2022 affect McDonald's supply chain risks and Tesla's automotive gross margin, and what contrasting strategies did each company employ to mitigate these pressures?",
      "answer": "Rising commodity costs in 2022 heightened McDonald's exposure to supply chain risks, particularly through increased scrutiny and pressure to maintain supplier compliance with product specifications and sustainability standards. This could lead to higher operational costs and reputational risks. In contrast, Tesla explicitly noted rising raw material, commodity, logistics, and expedite costs that pressured automotive gross margin, although these were offset by localized procurement and manufacturing scale in China, especially for Model 3 and Model Y, which significantly reduced per-unit costs. McDonald's managed this risk through systemwide coordination and supplier standards, while Tesla leveraged localized manufacturing and product learning curves to reduce costs despite commodity headwinds.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - MCD_10k_2022.pdf: Commodity costs are listed as a risk factor heightened by ESG pressures and supply chain interruptions.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - Rising commodity costs impacted both companies, but in different ways: McDonald's faced increased supply chain risk and reputational exposure, while Tesla experienced margin pressure offset by localized manufacturing efficiencies."

          "chunk_text": "## Our business is subject to an increasing focus on ESG matters.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders - including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and investors - on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG initiatives could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our System. We may face increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We may also face increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.\n\n## Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.\n\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, climate change or terrorist activities (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.\n\n## LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of such claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed under 'Government Regulations' below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits, laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on the Company's net income for the period in which it occurs and/or future periods.\n\n## \u25aa Franchising\n\nA substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding franchise grants or terminations, alleged discrimination, delinquent payments of rents and fees and claims for additional franchises or franchise renewals. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.\n\n## \u25aa Suppliers\n\nThe Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company's high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company's business relationship with suppliers. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company's restaurants.\n\n## \u25aa Employees\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes occasionally arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including, but not limited to, wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws.\n\n## \u25aa Customers\n\nMcDonald's restaurants - whether owned by subsidiaries of the Company, independent owner/operators or developmental licensees - regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes occasionally arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.",

          "chunk_text": "Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $415 million, or 74%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cost of automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.24 billion, or 46%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of non-Tesla used vehicles, costs to support our increase in non-warranty maintenance services revenue and costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased.\n\nGross margin for total automotive increased from 25.6% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 29.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of Model 3 and Model Y as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity. The average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit have decreased significantly due to localized procurement and manufacturing in China despite rising raw material, commodity, logistics and expedite costs. Additionally, our Model Y gross margin has benefitted from shared manufacturing of Model 3 and learnings from the scaling of past products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $115 million in sales of regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them.\n\nGross margin for total automotive &amp; services and other segment increased from 22.4% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 26.9% in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, there was a lower proportion of services and other, which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business, within the segment in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

These decreases were partially offset by a higher proportion of Powerwall in our overall energy business which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an increase in Megapack gross margin as we continue to scale the products.\n\n## Research and Development Expense\n\n",

HD had a net property and equipment value of $25,199 million with accumulated depreciation of $26,130 million, while MCD had a net property and equipment value of $24,720.6 million with accumulated depreciation of $17,196 million. HD's higher accumulated depreciation relative to its total property and equipment suggests a more aggressive depreciation strategy or older asset base compared to MCD.",

          "chunk_text": "## STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH\n\nAt least annually, McDonald's considers which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. The Company is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of its revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of its size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, the Company believes that such a comparison is not meaningful.\n\nThe Company's market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\"DJIA\") since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, the Company believes that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate.\n\nThe following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index (\"S&amp;P 500 Index\") and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2016. For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the DJIA Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration.\n\n",

      "answer": "$3,371 million. Tesla generated $8,319 million in Services and Other revenue in 2023 after a 37% increase from 2022. GM generated $5,157 million in Services and Other revenue in 2023. This reveals that while Tesla is growing its services segment more rapidly (37% growth), GM maintains a significantly larger absolute revenue position in automotive services despite having a smaller growth trajectory, highlighting different competitive positions in the automotive services market.",

      "question": "Given GM's high fixed cost structure that makes vehicle sales volume volatility disproportionately impact profitability, and Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments that provide more predictable revenue streams, how do these contrasting financial structures affect each company's exposure to market fluctuations in vehicle sales?",
      "answer": "GM's high fixed cost structure means that small changes in vehicle sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability, making them highly exposed to market fluctuations. In contrast, Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments, which commenced between 2024 and 2025 with lease terms up to 20 years, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream, reducing their short-term exposure to sales volatility. This contrast in financial structures means that GM faces greater financial risk during periods of declining sales, while Tesla's leasing model offers a buffer against immediate market fluctuations through long-term contractual revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - GM has a high proportion of fixed structural costs, so small changes in sales volume disproportionately affect profitability.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Tesla has $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments that commenced between 2024 and 2025, with lease terms of up to 20 years.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - These contrasting financial models (fixed cost exposure vs. long-term lease revenue predictability) directly influence how each company experiences and manages risk from vehicle sales volatility."

      "answer": "BKNG's non-current operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023, were $599 million, while GM's were $907 million, resulting in a combined total of $1,506 million. BKNG's total operating lease liabilities were $751 million, so its non-current portion represents approximately 79.8% of the total. GM's total operating lease liabilities were $1,171 million (sum of $264 million current and $907 million non-current), meaning its non-current portion accounts for about 77.5% of the total.",

      "answer": "Tesla's sales return reserve estimation methodology, which incorporates historical experience and expected future market values, introduces potential volatility into their financial reporting due to reliance on forward-looking assumptions. This could result in fluctuating reserve amounts year-over-year, directly affecting automotive revenue recognition and potentially impacting financial covenants tied to revenue stability or liquidity metrics. In contrast, Lowe's sales return reserve decreased from $234 million to $191 million with relatively stable figures, suggesting less volatility in their financial reporting and more predictability in meeting covenants. Tesla's approach, tied to resale value guarantees and market value estimates, exposes them to greater estimation uncertainty, which could lead to larger adjustments and more significant impacts on financial statements and covenant compliance.",

        "Step 1: Extract Lowe's sales return reserve figures from evidence_source_a - $191 million in 2024 and $234 million in 2023, indicating a relatively stable and concrete reserve amount.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize the implications - Tesla's estimation methodology introduces forward-looking assumptions about future market conditions, which could lead to greater volatility in reserve amounts and revenue recognition compared to Lowe's more stable reserve figures. This volatility could directly impact Tesla's financial covenants, which may be sensitive to revenue fluctuations or liquidity metrics."

      "answer": "LOW's Sales Return Reserve decreased from $234 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in its estimated obligation for customer returns. Tesla, on the other hand, recognizes a Sales Return Reserve based on historical experience and expected future market values when offering resale value guarantees, indicating a proactive financial obligation tied to vehicle buyback programs. This reveals that while both companies account for potential returns, Tesla's reserve is tied to structured buyback guarantees, whereas LOW's reflects a declining historical trend.",

      "question": "How does TSLA's operating lease receivables position in 2027 compare to LOW's operating lease liabilities for the same year, and what might this suggest about their contrasting roles and financial strategies in lease arrangements?",
      "answer": "TSLA reports $227 million in operating lease receivables for 2027, while LOW reports $608 million in operating lease liabilities for the same year. This $381 million difference suggests that TSLA is positioned as a lessor collecting lease payments, whereas LOW operates as a lessee making lease payments. The contrast reflects differing business models: TSLA monetizes assets through leasing, while LOW incurs lease costs as part of its operational expenses.",

      "answer": "If interchange fees for third-party payment processors increased, both BKNG and LOW would experience a rise in operating costs, which could harm their profit margins. BKNG explicitly states that if fees are increased for any reason, it could harm its profit margin, business, and results of operations. Similarly, LOW mentions that interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise its operating costs. Since both companies rely on third-party payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, any increase in interchange fees would directly impact their operating costs, potentially reducing profitability unless these costs can be passed on to customers or offset through other cost-saving measures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - BKNG mentions that an increase in interchange fees could harm its profit margin, business, and results of operations.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LOW states that interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise its operating costs.",

      "answer": "McDonald's emphasizes a consistent dividend policy, having paid dividends for 49 consecutive years through 2024, and plans to continue increasing dividend amounts based on profitability expectations and financing needs. This indicates a stable and predictable approach to returning cash to shareholders primarily through dividends. In contrast, Starbucks takes a dual approach, using its $3.8 billion in cash and investments as of September 29, 2024, to fund both cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Starbucks' strategy is more flexible, combining dividends with opportunistic share buybacks, which can vary depending on financial conditions and strategic priorities. Therefore, while both companies return cash to shareholders, McDonald's strategy is more dividend-centric and historically consistent, whereas Starbucks balances dividends with repurchases as part of its broader capital allocation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - McDonald's has paid dividends on common stock for 49 consecutive years through 2024 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - McDonald's consistent dividend history reflects a stable, dividend-focused shareholder return strategy, while Starbucks' use of both dividends and repurchases indicates a more flexible, dual-pronged approach."

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024, or 5%, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($93 million), investments in partner wages and benefits ($57 million), and certain proxy solicitation and advisory services costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ($28 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of donations to The Starbucks Foundation made in fiscal 2023 ($30 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing Capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 'Base Rate' is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.",

      "answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs primarily through its lessee role in a significant real estate portfolio, where it often owns the building but leases the land. These occupancy costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance, are generally paid by franchisees for franchised locations, which make up the majority of McDonald's restaurants. This indicates a strategy where the financial burden of occupancy costs is largely shifted to franchisees, allowing McDonald's to maintain a more asset-light model. In contrast, Starbucks directly incorporates occupancy costs into its store operating expenses for company-operated locations, reflecting a more direct financial responsibility for these costs. This reveals that McDonald's leverages its franchise model to outsource occupancy-related financial obligations, while Starbucks assumes these costs as part of its operational expenditures, highlighting a more vertically integrated approach to property management.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - McDonald's leases land for its restaurants and shifts occupancy costs like property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance to franchisees for franchised locations, which are the majority of its portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned and operated restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under nonrestaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 3 to 10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within M iscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2024-$907; 2023-$836; 2022-$864.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected the write-off of impaired software no longer in use of $72 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing M cDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office lev el, and internationally , at a market lev el. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of M cDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2024, the Company acquired restaurants from franchisees (including 228 restaurants in Israel, which are presented within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment) in order to support key franchising initiatives. Total restaurant acquisitions for the year resulted in the Company recording approximately $150 million of net tangible assets, $270 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $240 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the Company. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2024 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

Negative comparable sales across some markets, led by France, was partly offset by positive comparable sales in most markets.\n- Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed M arkets segment decreased 0.3%. The continued impact of the war in the M iddle East and negative comparable sales in China more than offset positive comparable sales in Latin A merica and Japan.\n\nEarnings and cash flow growth rates presented below were impacted in 2024 by restructuring charges associated with Accelerating the Organization and net charges primarily consisting of transaction costs, property sale gains and non-cash impairment charges associated with the sale of M cDonald's business in South Korea and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of M cDonald's business in Israel. A dditionally, 2023 results were impacted by charges related to the Company's Accelerating the Arches growth strategy, including restructuring charges associated with Accelerating the Organization, and charges related to the write-off of impaired software no longer in use.\n\nCurrent year and prior year charges and gains are detailed along with reconciliations to the non-GA A P measures in the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 13 and Operating Income section on page 18 in this Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition to the comparable sales results above, the Company had the following financial results in 2024:\n\n- Consolidated revenues increased 2% (2% in constant currencies) to $25.9 billion.\n- Systemwide sales increased 1% (2% in constant currencies) to $130.7 billion.\n- Consolidated operating income increased 1% (1% in constant currencies) to $11.7 billion.\n- Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, decreased from 46% in 2023 to 45% in 2024.\n- Diluted earnings per share of $11.39 decreased 1% (1% in constant currencies).\n- Cash provided by operations was $9.4 billion, a 2% decrease from the prior year.\n- Capital expenditures of $2.8 billion were mainly allocated to new restaurant openings and, to a lesser extent, to reinvestment in existing restaurants.\n- Free cash flow was $6.7 billion, an 8% decrease from the prior year.\n- Across the System, over 2,100 new restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened.\n- The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 6% to $1.77 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $7.08 per share.

When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit ex ceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit ex ceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets.\n\nWe recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information.\n\n## Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contractbased patents, and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, indicating that the carrying value of the intangibles may not be recoverable. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group ex ceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change.\n\nThere were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information.\n\n## Insurance Reserves\n\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers' compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, and property insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims ex perience, demographics, ex posure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nConsolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to, and royalty and other fees from, licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances, and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates.\n\n## Company-operated Store Revenues\n\nCompany-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point-of-sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied.

This affects its ability to maintain service quality and execute omnichannel strategies, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing. Nike, on the other hand, is exposed to wage rate fluctuations and labor standards in international markets where its contract manufacturers operate. These external wage pressures influence Nike's manufacturing and sourcing costs, as well as its ability to maintain production timelines and cost controls. While both companies face wage-related challenges, Lowe's labor issues are internal and operational, directly affecting its U.S. retail strategy, whereas Nike's are external and supply chain-based, affecting product availability and cost of goods sold.

These initiatives have required, and will continue to require, new competencies in many positions, and our management, associates, and contractors have had to, and will need to continue to, adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and ex pand our relevant market access. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. Our results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent ex perience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not meet our customers' expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors, or if we are unable to attract, retain, and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the Company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment.\n\nWe have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our strategic initiatives effectively, or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs, resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors. The principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores, product assortment, product pricing, in-stock levels, customer service, and the evolution of technology and customer expectations. We face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering. Customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product availability and price using digital tools. We will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than us in their utilization and integration of rapidly evolving technologies, including AI and machine learning technologies. Further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including same-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, and we must make investments to keep up with our customers' evolving shopping preferences. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based delivery model, and our relationships with third parties providing delivery services. Our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance. Moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.\n\nIf we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, our labor costs and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur customers expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide. We compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are ex periencing a competitive labor market with low unemployment. Increasingly, our sales associates must have expanded skill sets. It is important that we attract and retain a qualified workforce that can deliver relevant, competent, and differentiated ex periences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers. Additionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers and related strategic objectives, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly sought after by our competitors. Further, our ability to successfully ex ecute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, are critical to our business success. The loss of key executive or senior officers or our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management personnel could impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nOur ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of ex ternal factors, including wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent, health care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, health care benefits, and family and medical leave. We are subject to upward pressure on associate wages and employer-provided benefits, which in turn increases labor costs. Additionally, many associates are in entrylevel or part-time roles with historically higher turnover rates, which leads to increased training and retention costs. Further, we are subject to labor organizing efforts from time to time, and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business. Our response to any organizing efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation. In addition to our United States operations, we have support",

      "answer": "LOW defines ROIC as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' deficit. NKE, on the other hand, describes ROIC as a performance measure that reflects the company's ability to manage invested capital but does not specify a detailed calculation. LOW provides a reconciliation from net earnings to Lease adjusted NOPAT, while NKE only states that ROIC is considered useful by management without disclosing a full formula or specific components like NOPAT or capital structure.",

      "answer": "The total dollar value of forfeited units is $98.685 million for General Motors and $10.708 million for Lowe's, totaling $109.393 million. General Motors' forfeited units had a weighted-average grant date fair value of $36.55 per unit, while Lowe's forfeited units had an average grant-date fair value of $205.94 per unit. This significant difference in grant date fair value suggests that Lowe's equity compensation awards carry higher per-unit value, potentially reflecting differences in compensation philosophy, stock price levels, or the structure of equity incentives between the two companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, identify the number of forfeited units (2.7 million) and their weighted-average grant date fair value ($36.55). Multiply these to get the total dollar value of $98.685 million.",
        "Step 2: From Lowe's 10-K, identify the number of forfeited units (52 thousand) and their weighted-average grant date fair value ($205.94). Multiply these to get the total dollar value of $10.708 million.",
        "Step 3: Add the total dollar values of forfeited units from both companies to arrive at $109.393 million.",

      "answer": "Amazon's 2024 non-operating expense of $2,012 million was reported in the reconciliation of net income to cash from operating activities, but the filing did not specify a direct relationship between this expense and the company's effective tax rate. In contrast, McDonald's filing explicitly stated that its $537 million non-operating expense from the settlement of a tax audit in France was non-deductible and therefore had an unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate. This difference in disclosure shows that while both companies reported non-operating expenses, only McDonald's explicitly tied its expense to a tax-related consequence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From Amazon's 2024 10-K, identify the reported non-operating expense of $2,012 million and note that it is listed in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement, with no direct explanation of tax impact.",
        "Step 2: From McDonald's 2024 10-K, identify the $537 million non-operating expense related to a French tax audit settlement and note its stated impact as non-deductible, which unfavorably affected the effective tax rate.",
        "Step 3: Compare the two disclosures to determine how each company explained the relationship between non-operating expenses and tax implications, revealing that only McDonald's explicitly connected the two."

      "answer": "Amazon's 2024 consolidated operating income grew from $36.852 billion to $68.593 billion, an increase of $31.741 billion. This growth was driven by strong performance across all segments: North America increased from $14.877 billion to $24.967 billion (+$10.090 billion), International improved from a loss of $2.656 billion to a profit of $3.792 billion (+$6.448 billion), and AWS expanded from $24.631 billion to $39.834 billion (+$15.203 billion). In contrast, McDonald's reported a 1% increase in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion, but faced geographic challenges with global comparable sales declining 0.1%, including negative results in France and China that required offsetting gains elsewhere. Unlike Amazon's consistent segment growth, McDonald's performance was mixed across regions, with restructuring charges and external factors like the war in the Middle East affecting results.",

We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. For more information on the operating expenses that impact segment operating income, see 'Operating Expenses' and the descriptions of operating expense line item changes on pages 25 to 27, and 'Note 10 - Segment Information' on page 65.\n\nThe increase in North America operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs.\n\nThe International operating income in 2024, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs. Changes in foreign ex change rates did not significantly impact operating income in 2024.\n\nThe increase in AWS operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, decreased payroll and related expenses, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers, partially offset by spending on technology infrastructure that was primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $240 million in 2024.\n\n## Interest Income and Expense\n\nOur interest income was $2.9 billion and $4.7 billion during 2023 and 2024, primarily due to a higher average balance of invested funds at prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\n\nInterest ex pense was $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2023 and 2024 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Leases and Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nOur long-term lease liabilities were $77.3 billion and $78.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our long-term debt was $58.3 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Leases and Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net was $938 million and $(2.3) billion during 2023 and 2024. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2023 and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $797 million and $(1.6) billion from our equity investment in Rivian.",

      "answer": "GM Financial incorporates disposable personal income as one of several economic factors in its static pool modeling to forecast expected credit losses on retail finance receivables, adjusting the allowance for loan losses based on projected impacts of changes in this metric. Lowe\u2019s, on the other hand, depends on disposable personal income as a core demand driver that influences homeowner spending on repairs and upgrades, particularly among millennials forming households and elderly individuals aging in place. Therefore, a decline in disposable personal income could simultaneously increase credit risk in GM\u2019s finance receivables while reducing demand in Lowe\u2019s home improvement market, creating dual financial pressures across both companies.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

In contrast, LOW saw a 0.1% decrease in comparable average ticket, which had a minimal negative impact on its revenue per transaction. While both companies faced slight declines, HD's performance was slightly worse, as its average ticket dropped from $90.36 in fiscal 2022 to $90.07 in fiscal 2023, whereas LOW's change was smaller in magnitude and occurred against a backdrop of a larger 4.6% drop in customer transactions.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies saw declines in average ticket, but HD's decrease reflects a concrete drop in average transaction value, while LOW's change was smaller and occurred alongside a significant drop in customer traffic, indicating different underlying sales pressures."

This indicates that TSLA's stock-based compensation is spread over a longer time horizon compared to HD, suggesting a more extended vesting schedule or a strategy to align compensation with long-term performance goals. The longer recognition period for TSLA may result in more prolonged financial statement impacts, whereas HD's shorter timeline implies faster expense recognition, potentially reflecting a more immediate incentive structure for employees.",

In contrast, TSLA elects not to present short-term leases (12 months or less) on the balance sheet, recognizing only long-term lease assets and liabilities. This means TSLA's balance sheet may understate lease obligations compared to HD's, where all relevant lease liabilities are explicitly included, thereby affecting cross-company comparability and financial leverage ratios.",

      "answer": "Tesla manages its customer receivables through Variable Interest Entity (VIE) arrangements, where it consolidates the financial position and results of operations of these VIEs into its financial statements. Tesla's VIE agreements grant it the power to manage and make decisions affecting the operation of these entities, including managing customer receivables, while fund investors have more protective rights. In contrast, Home Depot addresses credit risk related to its customer receivables through a valuation allowance, which was explicitly stated as not being material to its consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. This indicates that Tesla assumes more direct control and operational involvement in receivables management through third-party arrangements, while Home Depot relies on internal reserves to mitigate credit risk, suggesting a more self-contained and conservative risk management framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Home Depot uses a valuation allowance for its customer receivables, which was not material to its consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or 2022.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Tesla manages customer receivables through VIEs, where it has decision-making power and operational control, while consolidating the VIEs\u2019 financials and eliminating intercompany balances.",

      "question": "How does the management of existing inventory contribute to cash flow improvements for HD, and how does this compare to SBUX's strategy for ensuring green coffee supply adequacy through fiscal 2025?",
      "answer": "HD managed its existing inventory more effectively in fiscal 2023, which contributed to a $6.6 billion increase in operating cash flow compared to fiscal 2022. This was achieved by normalizing inventory levels, adjusting purchasing to align with demand, and selling through existing inventory. In contrast, SBUX ensures its green coffee supply adequacy through a combination of fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars. SBUX also relies on existing inventory, which, together with purchase commitments, is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2025. While HD's strategy focuses on optimizing cash flow through inventory reduction and timing of payments, SBUX's approach centers on securing supply stability despite volatile coffee prices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - HD's $6.6 billion increase in operating cash flow was driven by lower inventory purchases and normalized inventory levels.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - SBUX uses purchase commitments and existing inventory to ensure an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2025.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies leverage inventory-related strategies, but HD focuses on cash flow optimization through inventory reduction, while SBUX emphasizes supply stability through contractual commitments and inventory reserves."

      "answer": "The 4% decline in average ticket directly contributed to the 4% decline in comparable store sales for SBUX in fiscal 2024, as average ticket is a key component of store sales performance. In contrast, HD experienced a slight decrease in average ticket, with the metric falling from $90.36 in fiscal 2022 to $90.07 in fiscal 2023, representing a 0.3% decline. This indicates that while SBUX faced a significant drag on sales from declining average ticket, HD's average ticket remained relatively stable during its fiscal year.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - HD's average ticket declined slightly from $90.36 in fiscal 2022 to $90.07 in fiscal 2023 (0.3% decrease).",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - SBUX's international comparable store sales declined 4% in fiscal 2024, driven entirely by a 4% decline in average ticket.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The question connects both companies through the shared connector 'Average Ticket' to compare performance and impact. SBUX's 4% decline in average ticket directly caused a 4% decline in comparable store sales, showing a strong causal relationship. Meanwhile, HD experienced a much smaller 0.3% decline in average ticket, indicating more stability in customer spending per transaction."

      "question": "AMZN mentions that variations in merchandise returns can materially impact their operating results, while LOW discloses a merchandise return reserve accounted for through a reduction of sales and cost of sales. Given these disclosures, how do the financial risks associated with merchandise returns manifest differently for AMZN and LOW in terms of revenue recognition and operating performance, and what does this reveal about their respective business models?",
      "answer": "For AMZN, merchandise returns are highlighted as a risk factor that can materially affect their operating results, indicating that higher-than-expected returns could lead to inventory write-downs, increased logistics costs, and reduced profitability. This reflects the complexity and scale of their fulfillment operations and the direct impact of consumer behavior on their bottom line. For LOW, merchandise returns are accounted for through a reduction of both sales and cost of sales, with a specific reserve presented on a gross basis in the balance sheet. This implies that LOW proactively estimates and adjusts for returns at the point of sale, which stabilizes reported revenue and gross margin impacts. The difference in how merchandise returns affect financial risk reveals that AMZN's e-commerce model is more exposed to unpredictable return volumes due to the nature of online shopping, while LOW, as a home improvement retailer, may have more predictable return patterns and a different fulfillment structure that allows for more controlled accounting treatment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - AMZN identifies 'variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns' as a risk factor that could materially harm their business and operating results.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - LOW recognizes revenue net of a provision for anticipated merchandise returns, which is accounted for as a reduction of both sales and cost of sales, with a separate gross reserve on the balance sheet.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - While both companies disclose merchandise returns as a financial risk, the way in which the risk manifests differs: AMZN emphasizes the operational and financial volatility from unpredictable returns, whereas LOW shows a structured accounting approach that anticipates returns and adjusts revenue accordingly. This contrast reflects differences in their business models\u2014AMZN's large-scale e-commerce model versus LOW's more controlled retail and fulfillment environment."

The Company is also self-insured for certain losses relating to extended protection plans, as well as medical and dental claims.  Selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management's estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience.  Although management believes it has the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. Total self-insurance liabilities, including the current and non-current portions, were $966 million as of January 31, 2025, and $1.1 billion as of February 2, 2024.\n\nThe Company provides surety bonds issued by insurance companies to secure payment of workers' compensation liabilities as required in certain states where the Company is self-insured. Outstanding surety bonds relating to self-insurance were $272 million as of January 31, 2025, and $280 million as of February 2, 2024.\n\nIncome Taxes - The Company establishes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities.  The tax  effects of such differences are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the enacted tax  rates ex pected to be in effect when the differences reverse.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized.  The tax  balances and income tax  ex pense recognized by the Company are based on management's interpretation of the tax statutes of multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company establishes a liability for tax positions for which there is uncertainty as to whether or not the position will be ultimately sustained.  The Company includes interest related to tax  issues as part of net interest on the consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company records any applicable penalties related to tax issues within the income tax provision.\n\n## Transferable Tax Credits\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted which included provisions that allow for the transfer of certain federal clean energy tax credits (Federal Transferable Tax Credits). The Company paid $909 million and $143 million for the purchase of Federal Transferable Tax Credits in 2024 and 2023, respectively. All amounts paid have been included in payments for income taxes, and differences between tax credits purchased and amounts paid are included as a component of the income tax provision.\n\n## Income Tax Relief\n\nOn October 1, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service announced that businesses in North Carolina, affected by Hurricane Helene would receive tax relief by postponing certain tax -payment deadlines. Under this relief, certain federal estimated income tax  payments can be deferred until May 1, 2025. As of January 31, 2025, the Company deferred $478 million of federal income tax es payable, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nShareholders' Deficit The Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private market transactions. Shares purchased under the repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status. Any excess of cost over par value is charged to additional paid-in capital to the ex tent that a balance is present. Once additional paid-in capital is fully depleted, remaining ex cess of cost over par value is charged to accumulated deficit.\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases after December 31, 2022. Any excise tax incurred on share repurchases is recognized as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the consolidated statements of shareholders' deficit.\n\nRevenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. A description of the Company's principle revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\n- Products Revenue from products primarily relates to in-store and online merchandise purchases, which are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the merchandise. This occurs at the time of in-store purchase or delivery of the product to the customer. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.  The merchandise return reserve is presented on a gross basis, with a separate asset and liability included in the consolidated balance sheets.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of self-insurance liabilities for Amazon and Lowe's as of their respective fiscal years ended in 2024, and what does this reveal about their relative risk exposure in the Consumer Discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "The combined total of self-insurance liabilities for Amazon and Lowe's as of their respective fiscal years ended in 2024 is $8.932 billion. Amazon reported $8.5 billion in self-insurance liabilities, while Lowe's reported $432 million. This significant disparity reveals that Amazon assumes a much larger self-insured risk exposure compared to Lowe's, which may reflect Amazon's broader operational scale, more complex global logistics network, and higher employee base, all of which contribute to greater potential liabilities that the company retains rather than insuring through third-party providers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon's self-insurance liabilities as of December 31, 2024, were $8.5 billion.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Lowe's self-insurance liabilities as of January 31, 2025 (their fiscal year-end), were $432 million.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined total - $8.5 billion + $432 million = $8.932 billion.",
        "Step 4: Analyze the difference in scale - Amazon's liabilities are nearly 20x greater than Lowe's, suggesting a significantly higher level of retained risk, which aligns with Amazon's larger global operations and workforce."

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our total self-insurance liabilities were $6.3 billion and $8.5 billion and are included in 'Accrued ex penses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Unearned Revenue\n\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.9 billion, of which $14.2 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $24.6 billion. Included in 'Other long-term liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets was $5.7 billion and $6.5 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that ex ceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $177 billion as of December 31, 2024. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.1 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\n\n## Other Long-Term Liabilities\n\nIncluded in 'Other long-term liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax  contingencies, deferred tax  liabilities, and digital video and music content.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign ex change rates, and revenues and ex penses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),' a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $386 million, $(329) million, and $413 million in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued an Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We expect to adopt the ASU on a retroactive basis.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued an ASU amending existing income statement disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for expenses. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.

Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\n\n## Self-Insurance\n\n## Description\n\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, property, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims. We have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility. Our selfinsured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, and $10 million per occurrence involving general liability, product liability, and automobile liability. We do not have any ex cess insurance coverage for self-insured ex tended protection plan or medical and dental claims. Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. During fiscal 2024, our self-insurance liabilities decreased approximately $138 million to $966 million as of January 31, 2025.\n\n## Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\n\n## Effect if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $72 million for fiscal 2024. A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for fiscal 2024.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are ex posed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe use interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt. The fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of January 31, 2025, was not material. Fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because nearly all of our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fix ed-rate instruments.  Therefore, providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control, which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.  We believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices.  The selling prices of these commodity products are influenced, in part, by the market price we pay and our competitive environment.",

      "question": "How do elevated commodity costs impact both General Motors' electric vehicle raw material sourcing strategy and McDonald's restaurant profitability, given their respective exposures as detailed in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Elevated commodity costs impact General Motors by increasing the cost of EV raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt, which are essential for their transition to electric vehicles. GM's sourcing strategy involves securing supply through long-term commitments and higher inventory levels, which exposes them to increased costs due to market volatility and government policies. Similarly, McDonald's profitability is affected by rising commodity costs for ingredients like beef, chicken, and pork, which are subject to volatility due to climate conditions, global demand, and regulatory factors. These increased costs cannot be fully mitigated through hedging, directly affecting restaurant profitability. Both companies face financial risks from commodity cost fluctuations, though the specific materials and mitigation strategies differ based on their industries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - General Motors mentions that commodity costs are elevated due to macro-economic conditions and that EV raw materials (e.g., lithium, nickel, cobalt) require long-term sourcing commitments and higher inventory levels.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - McDonald's reports that commodity cost increases, particularly for beef, chicken, and pork, are volatile and difficult to hedge, adversely affecting restaurant profitability.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies are negatively impacted by rising commodity costs, but the nature of the commodities and the strategies to manage them differ significantly due to their respective industries (automotive manufacturing vs. food service)."

      "question": "Based on their 2023 diluted earnings per common share disclosures, how do GM's and MCD's capital structure strategies regarding share-based compensation differ?",
      "answer": "GM reports diluted earnings per common share of $7.32 for 2023, with 1,369 million weighted-average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis. McDonald's specifically discloses that 4.4 million shares from share-based compensation were included in its diluted weighted-average shares calculation for 2023. This indicates GM takes a more passive approach to equity compensation with no explicit mention of share-based award impacts on dilution, while McDonald's actively manages its share count through structured equity compensation plans that directly affect diluted EPS calculations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, extract diluted earnings per common share of $7.32 and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 1,369 million",
        "Step 2: From McDonald's 10-K, extract the specific disclosure that 4.4 million shares from share-based compensation were included in diluted weighted-average shares calculation",
        "Step 3: Compare approaches - GM does not explicitly disclose share-based compensation impacts on dilution while McDonald's provides detailed disclosure of equity award inclusion",
        "Step 4: Conclude that McDonald's actively manages share dilution through structured compensation plans while GM's approach appears more passive"

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2024, we maintained valuation allowances of $1.22 billion for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized, which primarily included our California deferred tax  assets, U.S. foreign tax  credits and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax  credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax  assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future tax able earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax  assets are realizable and released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax  assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the ex pectation of future earnings in the respective jurisdictions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.34 billion of federal and $8.59 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future tax able income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to ex pire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax  credit carry-forwards in the event of an 'ownership change,' as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.48 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $1.01 billion, and state research and development tax credits of $1.06 billion. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax  credits may ex pire in various amounts beginning in 2035. However, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other tax es have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $309 million.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Nike explicitly includes inventory costs as a primary component of its cost of sales, alongside warehousing costs, third-party royalties, foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and product design costs. This indicates that inventory directly influences Nike's cost of sales and profitability. In contrast, Tesla does not explicitly mention inventory costs as a distinct component of its cost of sales. Instead, Tesla emphasizes design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing approaches, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics. Tesla's focus is on reducing manufacturing complexity, such as through direct integration of batteries with vehicle body structures, to improve manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency. Thus, Nike emphasizes inventory as a direct cost driver, while Tesla highlights design and manufacturing optimization as key contributors to cost efficiency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Nike's cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs, third-party royalties, foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and product design costs.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Tesla focuses on design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics, including manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Nike explicitly identifies inventory costs as a primary component of its cost of sales, while Tesla does not directly reference inventory costs but instead emphasizes design and manufacturing optimizations to achieve cost efficiency. These differences reflect their respective business models: Nike as a consumer goods company reliant on inventory management, and Tesla as an automotive and energy company focused on engineering and production innovation."

By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.\n\n## Design and Engineering\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has significant ex perience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\n\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, diemaking and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as necessary.\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Direct Sales\n\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\n\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.",

Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Automotive Leasing\n\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\n\n## Services and Other\n\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to affect tax able income. V aluation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax  assets to the amount expected to be realized.",

W ithin the context of these critical accounting estim ates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circum stances that would result in m aterially different am ounts being reported.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\nEstim ates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claim s are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from  custom ers and outstanding discounts and claim s and (3) estim ated returns, discounts and claim s expected but not yet finalized with custom ers. Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determ ination was m ade.\n\nRefer to N ote 14 - R evenues in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INVENTORY RESERVES\n\nWe make ongoing estim ates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assum ptions about future dem and and m arket conditions. If we estim ate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estim ated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to C ost of sales. If changes in m arket conditions result in reductions to the estim ated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estim ate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we m ade such a determ ination.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency m onetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been m et, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), rather than N et incom e, until the underlying hedged transaction affects N et incom e. In m ost cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) into N et incom e som etim e after the m aturity of the derivative. O ne of the criteria for this accounting treatm ent is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated am ount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estim ates of anticipated transactions m ay fluctuate over tim e and m ay ultim ately vary from  actual transactions. W hen the designated am ount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified tim e period or within an additional two-m onth period of tim e thereafter, we reclassify the cum ulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from  Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) to Other (incom e) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circum stances, the additional period of tim e m ay exceed two m onths due to extenuating circum stances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\nRefer to N ote 12 - R isk M anagem ent and D erivatives in the accom panying N otes to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents for additional inform ation.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the U nited States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. T he determ ination of our provision for incom e taxes requires significant judgm ent, the use of estim ates and the interpretation and application of com plex tax laws. O n an interim  basis, we estim ate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. T his estim ated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Incom e before incom e taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item s, to determ ine the year-to-date Incom e tax expense. The incom e tax effects of infrequent or unusual item s are recognized in the interim  period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estim ate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estim ation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. W hen this occurs, we adjust the incom e tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estim ate occurs.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the am ount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circum stances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes.\n\nCash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was primarily driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Working capital was impacted by higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment and from higher product and transportation costs, along with timing of vendor payments.\n\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to $7.8 billion of net consideration paid to acquire HD Supply in fiscal 2020, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\n\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt.\n\nCash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $2.9 billion of repayments of long-term debt, $974 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and $791 million for share repurchases prior to our suspension of share repurchases in March 2020, partially offset by $7.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies\n\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n\n## Merchandise Inventories\n\nWe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.",

Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021.

In contrast, Tesla concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable based on recent taxable income and expected future taxable earnings, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance. This shows that Tesla has a more favorable outlook on future taxable earnings, directly impacting its tax expense and asset valuation differently than Nike\u2019s approach.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - NKE evaluates deferred tax assets based on forecasts of taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, but realization is uncertain.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - TSLA released $6.54 billion of valuation allowance on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to expected future taxable earnings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in their approaches to deferred tax asset realizability hinges on their respective assessments of future taxable earnings, with Tesla having a more positive outlook, leading to a significant financial impact through the release of valuation allowance."

      "answer": "Tesla's $16.40 billion in cash and cash equivalents, combined with its strategy to provide customer financing options, enhances its ability to fund over $10.00 billion in planned 2024 capital expenditures while maintaining liquidity flexibility. This contrasts with Nike's risk disclosure that constrained financing options could adversely affect its NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial investment and resource commitment, highlighting Tesla's stronger liquidity position and proactive capital deployment strategy versus Nike's exposure to financing limitations.",

This structure suggests inventory cost fluctuations could directly impact gross margins, especially given the company's global supply chain and potential for inventory write-downs. TSLA's modular manufacturing approach, which optimizes production capacity for both vehicles and energy storage systems, likely creates economies of scale that could stabilize inventory costs relative to production volume. The modular design reduces field assembly requirements and enables standardized component sourcing, potentially lowering inventory-related cost volatility compared to NKE's more traditional retail inventory model.",

      "answer": "Starbucks recognized $196.1 million in breakage revenue from company-operated stores and $18.9 million from licensed stores in fiscal year 2023, totaling $215.0 million. This breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to stored-value card redemptions.

        "Step 1: From SBUX evidence, extract breakage revenue for fiscal year 2023: $196.1 million (company-operated) and $18.9 million (licensed).",

        "Step 4: Compare treatment: Starbucks recognizes breakage as revenue over time based on redemption patterns, while Lowe\u2019s does not explicitly disclose a similar policy, suggesting differing accounting treatments for unredeemed stored-value cards."

      "answer": "Booking Holdings reported an increase in accounts receivable of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in business volumes. In contrast, Nike reported a $1,102 million decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2022, which was partially attributed to supply chain constraints. Booking Holdings' accounts receivable increase aligned with its explanation of higher business volumes, while Nike's decrease in accounts receivable was influenced by operational challenges related to inventory availability.",

Booking Holdings' increase was directly tied to higher business volumes, while Nike's decrease was influenced by supply chain disruptions that affected inventory availability and, consequently, accounts receivable."

These are obtained primarily for regulatory purposes and payment guarantees to third-party payment processors.\n\nMarketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our business. We rely on marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. We have established widely used and recognized ecommerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Trends\" and \"Results of Operations\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay our indebtedness.\n\n## Cash Flow Analysis\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion, resulting from net income of $1.2 billion and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.4 billion, and a favorable net change in working capital and other long-term assets and liabilities of $269 million. Non-cash items were principally associated with net losses on equity securities, deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and operating lease amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, accounts receivable increased by $1.0 billion and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $1.5 billion, primarily due to increases in business volumes.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85 million, resulting from net income of $59 million and a favorable impact from adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable net change in working capital and long-term assets and liabilities of $1.0 billion. Non-cash items were principally associated with net gains on marketable equity securities, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, stock-based compensation expense and other stock-based payments, deferred income tax expense, and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to Euro-denominated debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $161 million, primarily due to a refund for overpayment from a vendor and lower prepayment to third-party payment processors due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, accounts receivable decreased by $891 million and deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to decreases in business volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion, resulting from the acquisition of Getaroom of $1.2 billion, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $508 million, net of purchases of $17 million, and purchase of property and equipment of $304 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.6 billion, resulting from the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $3.0 billion, net of purchases of $74 million, and the purchase of property and equipment of $286 million. Cash invested in the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes payments of $52 million related to the turnkey agreement for constructing Booking.com's future headquarters.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.2 billion, almost entirely resulting from payments for redemption and conversion of debt of $3.1 billion and payments for the repurchase of common stock of $163 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $2.0 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.5 billion, almost entirely resulting from the proceeds from the",

          "chunk_text": "## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,188 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,657 million for fiscal 2021. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,612 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $45 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a $2,183 million increase in Inventories, partially offset by a favorable impact from a $1,102 million decrease in Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to supply chain constraints, which caused higher levels of in-transit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2022, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $747 million compared to a cash outflow of $3,276 million in fiscal 2021. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.\n\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021. This change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in $4,014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to $608 million during fiscal 2021.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we purchased 27.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,994 million (an average price of $146.11 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2022, we had repurchased 77.4 million shares at a cost of $8,663 million (an average price of $111.98 per share) under this program. In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.\n\n## CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the 'Shelf') with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022, and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2022.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 10, 2023, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 15, 2021, which would have matured on March 14, 2022. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we also entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16, 2024. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 45",

NKE, on the other hand, reported a $219 million net favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, which contributed significantly to the change in Other (income) expense, net from $14 million of expense in fiscal 2021 to $181 million of income in fiscal 2022. Therefore, while BKNG's FX gains/losses were a variable component of its other income/expense, NKE experienced a substantial favorable impact of $219 million from FX movements and hedging activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BKNG\u2019s filing, we learn that foreign currency transaction gains or losses on undesignated Euro-denominated debt are recognized in 'Other income (expense), net,' and are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Step 2: From NKE\u2019s filing, we find that foreign currency conversion gains and losses (including hedges) contributed a $219 million favorable change, which was a primary driver of the shift in Other (income) expense, net from $14 million expense to $181 million income year-over-year.",
        "Step 3: Synthesizing both, we see that FX gains/losses significantly influenced the financial performance of both companies in 2022, with NKE benefiting by a known $219 million and BKNG experiencing variable effects that were tied to exchange rate movements."

Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\"\n\nWe generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instruments in the future. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative contracts.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn December 2021, the spread of the Omicron variant and renewed travel restrictions in certain markets contributed to a 35% decline in room nights relative to December 2019. In January 2022, we saw room nights decline about 22% relative to January 2019, and in the first half of February 2022 room nights were about in line with the first half of February 2019, in each case primarily driven by improving room night trends in Europe. Given these rapid changes, particularly during the last six weeks, we cannot accurately predict the number of room nights that will be booked in the first quarter of 2022. Following from the above, for the first quarter of 2022 we currently expect:\n\n- the change in gross bookings relative to the first quarter of 2019 will be several percentage points better than the change in room nights for the same period primarily due to an increase in accommodation ADRs;\n- revenues as a percentage of gross bookings will be lower than it was in the first quarter of 2019; and\n- we will have an operating profit in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Seasonality and Other Timing Factors\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our gross bookings were generally similar in the first three quarters of the year and higher than in the fourth quarter. We generally recognize our marketing activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter when the gross bookings for the associated reservations are recognized. However, we would generally recognize revenue from these bookings when the travel begins (at \"check-in\"), and accommodation check-ins in Europe and North America are generally highest in the third quarter during those regions' peak summer travel season and lowest in the first quarter. As a result of this timing difference between when we record marketing expense and when we generally recognize associated revenue, we typically experience our highest levels of profitability in the third quarter and our lowest level of profitability in the first quarter. In addition to the typical seasonality effects on our business, our quarterly results and quarterly year-over-year growth rates can be impacted by:\n\n- The length of the booking window (the average time between the booking of a travel reservation and when the travel begins), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenues (recognized at the time of check-in);\n- The level of acceleration or deceleration in the gross bookings growth rate. For example, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted in the near term from gross bookings and related variable marketing expense growth acceleration, as revenue growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term. Any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent periods as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit; and\n- The date on which certain holidays (e.g., Easter and Ramadan) fall.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted the booking window and seasonality of our business in 2020 and 2021. For example, in 2021 we saw a contraction of the booking window as an increased percentage of bookings were made for travel that was to occur close to the time of booking. It is difficult to accurately predict travel patterns given the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not experience typical seasonality effects on our business throughout the duration of the pandemic, and potentially for some time thereafter. As the travel market recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to see periods of",

Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),' a separate component of stockholders' equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.'\n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion.

We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

This amount flowed directly to Tesla's net income. In contrast, Amazon disclosed that a 1% increase in its inventory valuation allowance would result in an additional $370 million in cost of sales. While Amazon's FX exposure is not explicitly quantified, changes in exchange rates could influence inventory valuation allowances, particularly for inventory held in foreign jurisdictions, thereby indirectly affecting its financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Nike's digital sales declined by 8% in fiscal 2024, but its total NIKE Direct revenue still increased by 1% due to comparable store sales growth and the addition of new stores. In contrast, Amazon, which operates almost entirely online, reported continued growth in its online sales, although the specific percentage is not provided, it is implied to be positive.

In contrast, Nike capitalizes expenditures for major software purchases and internal-use software, amortizing these costs over 2 to 12 years, and also capitalizes certain payroll costs for employees directly involved in software projects.

These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers' programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\n\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, were $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid ex penses and other current assets, which include amounts related to nonincome taxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to 'Technology and infrastructure.'\n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Property and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, five years",

At M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, Short-term  investm ents consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), unless unrealized losses are determ ined to be unrecoverable. R ealized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determ ined by specific identification. T he C om pany considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with m aturity dates beyond 12 m onths, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with m aturity dates beyond three m onths at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term  investm ents on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to N ote 4 - Fair Value M easurem ents for m ore inform ation on the C om pany's Short-term  investm ents.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist prim arily of am ounts due from  custom ers. T he C om pany m akes ongoing estim ates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from  the inability of its custom ers to m ake required paym ents. In addition to judgm ents about the creditworthiness of significant custom ers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the C om pany considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as m acroeconom ic and industry trends to determ ine the am ount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 m illion as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nI nventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the C om pany ships products directly from  its suppliers to the custom er, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. I nventory costs prim arily consist of product cost from  the C om pany's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, im port duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipm ent are recorded at cost. D epreciation is determ ined on a straight-line basis for land im provem ents, buildings and leasehold im provem ents over 2 to 40 years and for m achinery and equipm ent over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and am ortization of assets used in m anufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in C ost of sales. D epreciation and am ortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\n\n## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nExpenditures for m ajor software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and am ortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. T he C om pany's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use com puter software. T he C om pany also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for em ployees who are directly associated with internal use com puter software projects. T he am ount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is lim ited to the tim e directly spent on such projects. C osts associated with prelim inary project stage activities, training, m aintenance and all other post-im plem entation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\n\nDevelopm ent costs of com puter software to be sold, leased or otherwise m arketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to custom ers. In m ost instances, the C om pany's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software developm ent costs incurred subsequent to achievem ent of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, m ost software developm ent costs have been expensed as incurred.",

Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion in 2024, and deductions were also $5.5 billion, indicating a stable reserve. These allowances reduce both revenue and cost of sales. In contrast, NKE focuses on foreign currency risk management, actively hedging exposures to lessen the impact of currency fluctuations on financial results. NKE notes that currency volatility, especially a stronger U.S. Dollar, adversely affects the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and its hedging activities aim to reduce this volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n## Return Allowances\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Vendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.",

C entral banks deploy various strategies to com bat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which im pact our borrowing costs. G overnm ent shutdowns or the risk of governm ent shutdowns, as well as the im pact or expected im pact of elections, both in the U nited States and in other countries around the world, m ay also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and m ay continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that im pact the U .S. D ollar value relative to other international currencies. O ur international revenues and expenses generally are derived from  sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically am ounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U .S. D ollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U .S. D ollar adversely affects the U .S. D ollar value of the C om pany's foreign currency-denom inated sales and earnings. C urrency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent m anufacturers that produce our products by m aking their purchases of raw m aterials m ore expensive and m ore difficult to finance. F oreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to com pletely elim inate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative im pact of a stronger U .S. D ollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive im pact of a weaker U .S. D ollar or other trading currency. O ur future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U .S. D ollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given tim e period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our custom ers based on an assessm ent of a custom er's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. T o assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain custom ers the opportunity to place orders five to six m onths ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . T hese advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with econom ic uncertainty. In the past, som e custom ers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. W hen the retail econom y weakens or as consum er behavior shifts, retailers tend to be m ore cautious with orders. A slowing or changing econom y in our key m arkets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. I n addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality m erchandising and an appealing retail environm ent to attract consum ers, which requires continuing investm ents by retailers. R etailers that experience financial difficulties m ay fail to m ake such investm ents or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atm osphere have caused, and m ay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global tem peratures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extrem e weather and clim ate events. C lim ate change m ay also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw m aterials, including those used in the production of our products, and m ay result in changes in regulations or consum er preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. F or exam ple, there has been increased focus by governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, consum ers, custom ers, em ployees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably m ade and other sustainability m atters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and m aterials transparency, any of which m ay require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governm ental authorities in various countries are im plem enting, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or m itigate the im pacts of clim ate change on the environm ent. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of clim ate change, which could increase the com plexity of, and potential cost related to com plying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing m ay require us to m ake additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent, m ay im pact the availability and cost of key raw m aterials used in the production of our products or the dem and for our products, and, in turn, m ay adversely im pact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nI nvestors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing com panies' environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') com m itm ents, perform ance and disclosures, including related to clim ate change, and in recent years have placed increasing im portance on social costs and related im plications of their investm ents.

NKE reported a $1.588 billion increase ($7,429 million in fiscal 2024 vs. $5,841 million in fiscal 2023), which was primarily driven by favorable changes in working capital, particularly in inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and improved lead times.",

The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle's estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer's economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.\n\nDue to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles during 2021, we estimated that there is a lower future likelihood that customers will exercise their resale value guarantees. We adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulting in an increase of automotive sales revenues of $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a corresponding increase in cost of automotive sales of $286 million. The net benefit in gross profit was $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees was $223 million and $703 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of which $91 million and $202 million was short term, respectively.\n\nDeferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-theair software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Tesla's sales return reserve fluctuated significantly between 2019 and 2021. In 2019, a $555 million increase in the reserve reduced automotive sales revenue. In 2020, the reserve increased by $72 million, further reducing revenue. However, in 2021, actual return rates were lower than expected and resale values increased, leading to a net release of the reserve by $365 million, which increased automotive sales revenue. The cumulative impact of these changes from 2019 to 2021 was a net reduction of $262 million ($555M + $72M - $365M).

Actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of $365 million, which represented an increase in automotive sales revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, vehicle pricing reductions resulted in an increase of our reserve of $72 million and $555 million, respectively, which represented decreases in automotive sales revenue.\n\n## Automotive Segment\n\n## Automotive Sales Revenue\n\n## Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self Driving (\"FSD\") features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.",

In contrast, TSLA disclosed that its sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience and are 'immaterial in all periods presented,' indicating that the company does not set aside significant reserves due to its assessment that the economic incentives for customers to return vehicles are low. This contrast reveals that LOW, as a traditional retail business, faces more frequent and predictable product returns requiring explicit financial provisioning, while TSLA's automotive sales model, especially with resale value guarantees, involves less immediate return risk due to structured buyback terms and customer financing arrangements. As a result, TSLA's revenue recognition policy assumes lower variability in returns, whereas LOW's policy reflects a more direct and material exposure to returns.",

The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates.

We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.\n\nWe recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle's estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer's economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.",

      "answer": "The net difference in Cash Provided by Investing Activities between Amazon and Nike is $(50.694) billion. Amazon's Cash Provided by Investing Activities was $(49.8) billion in 2023, primarily due to purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures of $48.1 billion, with investments like $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC. Nike, in contrast, reported $894 million in Cash Provided by Investing Activities for fiscal 2024, mainly driven by a $1,721 million cash inflow from the net change in short-term investments. Amazon's negative figure reflects heavy capital investments and acquisitions, while Nike's positive inflow highlights a strategy of liquidating short-term investments.",

      "answer": "Amazon's cost of sales explicitly includes inbound and outbound shipping costs, which are a major component of its fulfillment expenses. This means that any increases in shipping costs directly raise Amazon's cost of sales, thereby reducing gross margins unless offset by other factors. In contrast, Nike reported that lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs contributed to a 220 basis point gross margin expansion. This indicates that while Amazon's cost structure is sensitive to shipping cost increases, Nike benefited from reduced logistics expenses, leading to improved profitability.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - Amazon's cost of sales includes 'inbound and outbound shipping costs,' directly linking shipping expenses to cost of sales.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - Amazon's cost of sales increases with higher shipping costs, which could compress margins, while Nike experienced margin expansion due to lower logistics costs, creating a contrast in how each company's financials are affected by shipping-related expenses."

      "answer": "Amazon experienced an increase in unit sales during its 2023 calendar year, which positively impacted both its North America and International segments' operating performance. Specifically, the North America operating income improvement and the reduced International operating loss were attributed to increased unit sales. In contrast, Nike reported a 12% decrease in combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels during its fiscal year 2023, which contributed to revenue declines and a 30% drop in EBIT. Therefore, while Amazon's unit sales growth supported stronger operating results, Nike's unit sales contraction significantly weakened its operating performance.",

The comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2022 was calculated using sales for a comparable 52-week period.\n- Average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. 3\n- Average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period. 4\n- Return on invested capital is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for additional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures. 5\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023\n\nNet Sales Net sales decreased 3.1% to $83.7 billion in fiscal 2024. The decrease in total sales was primarily driven by the decrease in comparable sales. Comparable sales decreased 2.7% over the same period, driven by a 3.0% decline in comparable customer transactions, and a 0.3% increase in comparable average ticket. Comparable sales change during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were declines of 4.1% in the first quarter, 5.1% in the second quarter, 1.1% in the third quarter, and an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we had comparable sales increases in Building Materials. An additional four product categories performed above the Company average, including Hardware, Rough Plumbing, Appliances, and Millwork. Strength in Building Materials reflects strong demand from Pro customers. Our DIY customer categories were impacted by lower DIY discretionary demand, particularly in bigger-ticket interior projects.\n\nGross Margin - Gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased seven basis points compared to fiscal 2023. The gross margin decrease for the year was primarily driven by investments in our supply chain, partially offset by productivity initiatives.\n\nSG&amp;A - SG&amp;A expense for fiscal 2024 deleveraged 72 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023. This was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits, due to higher bonus attainment and employee insurance costs, as well as cycling favorable legal settlements in the prior year.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged eight basis points for fiscal 2024 as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nInterest - Net - Net interest ex pense is comprised of the following:\n\n",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, HD reported Millwork Sales contributing 5.2% to its total Net Sales, while LOW reported Millwork Sales contributing 6.0% to its total Net Sales. Combined, Millwork Sales contributed 5.6% (average) to the total Net Sales of both companies in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2023, HD reported 5.4% and LOW also reported 6.0%, resulting in an average of 5.7%.

      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) experienced a decline in average ticket from $103.51 in 2023 to $103.37 in 2024, indicating slight downward pressure on per-customer spending. In contrast, Starbucks (SBUX) reported a 2% increase in average ticket, which helped offset a 4% decline in comparable transactions and contributed to overall revenue stability in company-operated stores. This comparison suggests that while a rising average ticket can help mitigate transaction declines in the retail sector, as seen with SBUX, even small declines in average ticket, like at LOW, may signal softer consumer spending or pricing pressures, potentially impacting total sales growth.",

We  exclude  leases  with  a  term  of  one  year  or  less  from  our  balance  sheet,  and  do  not separate non-lease components from our real estate leases.\n\nRent expense under operating leases was $294 million, $317 million and $354 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

These variable rent payments are based on a percent of sales and, as sales decreased in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, the related rent expense also decreased.\n\nThe Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company, and are not currently a future obligation.\n\nThe Company's lease portfolio includes both operating and finance leases, however as of December 31, 2021, the vast majority of the portfolio was classified as operating leases.\n\nAs the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.

          "chunk_text": "## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2021-$795.0; 2020-$691.2; 2019-$665.4.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as when new software may be ready for its intended use. The Company did not identify any indicators of impairment of capitalized software for the year ended December 31, 2021. Results for 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software of $26.3 million.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2021 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

HD reports $687 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of February 2, 2025, while Tesla reports $5.79 billion as of December 31, 2024. Tesla recognizes income tax benefits from stock-based compensation, amounting to $371 million in 2024, due to the release of valuation allowances on U.S. deferred tax assets in 2023.

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

We also acquired SRS to accelerate our growth with Pros. We continue to focus on driv ing productiv ity throughout the business by lowering our product and transportation costs, and in fiscal 2024 we executed a plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $500 million. The combination of reinv esting in our business to driv e higher sales and driv ing productiv ity to lower costs allows us to improv e our customer experience, increase our competitiv eness in the market, and deliv er shareholder v alue.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders in the form of cash div idends. We also returned $0.6 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 in anticipation of the SRS acquisition. Our capital allocation is discussed further in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n## OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe serve two primary customer groups - consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and Pros - and hav e dev eloped v arying approaches to meet their div erse needs:\n\n## DIY Customers\n\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist these customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to prov ide product and project knowledge. We also offer a v ariety of clinics and workshops to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. As the preferences and behav iors of our DIY customers are changing, we are inv esting in capabilities to better meet the ev olv ing expectations of these customers.\n\n## Professional Customers (or 'Pros')\n\nThese customers are primarily professional renov ators/remodelers, general contractors, small to medium homebuilders, maintenance professionals, handymen, property managers, building serv ice contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, landscapers, plumbers, painters, pool contractors, and roofers. These customers build, renov ate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including education, healthcare, gov ernment, institutional, and office buildings.\n\nWe have a number of initiativ es designed to driv e growth with Pros, including those working on both simple and complex projects. In fiscal 2024, we acquired SRS, which sells products to specialty trade roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors. We remain focused on prov iding a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, a broad assortment of Pro-focused products and brands, an extensiv e deliv ery network, our Pro X tra loyalty program, and enhanced credit offerings. Building on our historical strength as a destination for urgent purchase needs, we are inv esting in differentiated capabilities that will help us better serv e our Pros' complex purchase needs, including differentiated fulfillment options, additional trade credit offerings including our Pro House Account program, more showroom space, and an enhanced order management system. We also prov ide MRO products and related v alue-added serv ices to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and gov ernment housing facilities, among others, primarily through our subsidiary HD Supply.\n\n## DIFM Customers\n\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete their projects or installations. Currently, we offer installation serv ices in a v ariety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors, cabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these serv ices in our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serv ing our DIFM customer needs, we believ e our focus on the Pros who perform serv ices for these customers helps us driv e higher product sales.",

Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. The 53 week in fiscal 2024 added approximately $2.5 billion of net sales and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30. rd\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we opened ten new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico, resulting in a total store count of 2,347 at February 2, 2025. A total of 322 of our stores, or 13.7%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $599.92 in fiscal 2024. Our inv entory turnov er ratio was 4.7 times at the end of fiscal 2024, compared to 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2023. The increase in our inv entory turnov er ratio was primarily driv en by lower av erage inv entory lev els within our Primary segment during fiscal 2024.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we generated $19.8 billion of cash flow from operations, receiv ed approximately $10.0 billion of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt, net of discounts, and receiv ed $316 million of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments. We utilized a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt, together with cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of SRS, with cash purchase consideration totaling $17.7 billion. Specifically, in June 2024, leading up to the SRS acquisition on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of ov er $15.0 billion to fund the transaction, of which approximately $10.0 billion was then immediately repaid with the proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt. We hav e subsequently repaid all of the commercial borrowings used to fund the acquisition and ended fiscal 2024 with $316 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we also paid $8.9 billion in cash div idends, funded $3.5 billion in capital expenditures, repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt, and funded $649 million of share repurchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024.\n\nIn February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash div idend to $2.30 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 31.3% for fiscal 2024 and 36.7% for fiscal 2023. The decrease in ROIC was primarily driv en by higher av erage long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC.\n\n## SRS Acquisition\n\nOn March 27, 2024, we entered into a definitiv e agreement to acquire SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across sev eral verticals serv ing the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor. On June 18, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiv er of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approv als, the acquisition was completed and all merger consideration was transferred. We believ e the acquisition of SRS will accelerate the Company's growth with the Pro. The acquisition is expected to establish the Company as a leading specialty trade distributor across multiple v erticals, complement our existing capabilities, and enable us to better serv e complex project purchase occasions with the renov ator/remodeler.

      "answer": "General Motors' adjusted ROIC calculation differs significantly from Home Depot's standard ROIC metric due to the distinct capital intensity and operational structures of their industries. GM defines ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which are adjusted to account for automotive debt and interest liabilities, net pension and OPEB liabilities, and net income tax assets. This tailored approach reflects the capital-intensive nature of the automotive industry, where substantial investments in manufacturing infrastructure, R&D, and long-term liabilities significantly impact financial performance. In contrast, Home Depot, operating in the home improvement retail sector, uses the standard corporate finance definition of ROIC, which focuses on net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) relative to invested capital without the same level of industry-specific adjustments. This difference highlights how GM's business model requires more nuanced capital allocation tracking due to high fixed costs and long-term liabilities, whereas Home Depot's retail model involves more liquid and less capital-intensive operations.",

For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "What is the combined impact on effective tax rates in 2022 from state income tax considerations for both BKNG and SBUX, and how does this reflect their respective tax burdens?",
      "answer": "The combined impact of state income tax (benefit) expense on the effective tax rate in 2022 for BKNG and SBUX is 3.3% (from SBUX) and a negative 6 (basis points, or 0.06%) impact (from BKNG). This reflects that SBUX experienced a relatively higher state tax burden compared to BKNG, which had a slight tax benefit from state income taxes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From BKNG's 10-K filing (2022), extract the 'State income tax (benefit) expense' for 2022, which is listed as a negative $6 million, indicating a benefit, not an expense.",
        "Step 2: From SBUX's 10-K filing (2022), extract the 'State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit' which contributes 3.3% to the effective tax rate.",
        "Step 3: Convert BKNG's $6 million tax benefit into a percentage of the total tax expense to enable comparison with SBUX\u2019s 3.3% contribution. Since BKNG\u2019s total tax expense is $300 million, the benefit represents a 2% reduction (6/300 = 0.02 or 2%).",
        "Step 4: Combine the two impacts: SBUX has a 3.3% increase in effective tax rate due to state taxes, while BKNG has a 2% decrease, resulting in a net 1.3% increase across both companies."

      "question": "How did the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer discretionary spending differently affect the financial performance and strategic initiatives of Booking Holdings and Starbucks in 2022?",
      "answer": "The financial performance and strategic initiatives of Booking Holdings and Starbucks were both negatively affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer discretionary spending, but in different ways. Booking Holdings experienced a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities due to travel restrictions and reduced consumer confidence, which directly impacted their core travel-related services. They reported a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in accommodation room nights, which are central to their business model. Starbucks, on the other hand, faced disruptions in customer routines, reduced foot traffic in retail locations due to work-from-home policies, and a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages. These changes affected their ability to meet strategic goals, such as expanding their Channel Development business and introducing new product offerings. Both companies had to adapt to the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, but the nature of their exposure to consumer discretionary spending led to distinct financial and operational challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Booking Holdings reported a 'material decrease in consumer spending' and a 'significant decline in travel and restaurant activities' due to the pandemic, directly affecting their accommodation room nights and travel-related services.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - Starbucks faced disruptions in customer routines, reduced foot traffic due to work-from-home policies, and a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages, which impacted their strategic initiatives like expanding the Channel Development business and introducing new product offerings.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both companies were negatively impacted by the pandemic's effect on consumer discretionary spending, but the nature of their business models led to different financial and operational outcomes. Booking Holdings was more directly affected through travel restrictions and reduced travel confidence, while Starbucks faced challenges in adapting to changing consumer behavior and store traffic patterns."

We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions that prevent or reduce the impact of COVID-19 become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is dependent on the availability of a large number of accommodations (particularly independently-owned accommodations) and restaurants, and on the ability of consumers to travel to such accommodations and restaurants on airlines, railways, and rental cars. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by the various travel restrictions between countries. We do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel, and our travel service provider and restaurant partners are able to meet the demand for services. This may not occur until well after the broader global economy begins to improve. Additionally, our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns. Any increased unemployment is likely to have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending, including for the travel and restaurant industries. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.\n\nOur financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent, and duration of the global pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic; availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19, and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly; actions taken by national, state, and local governments to contain the disease or treat its impact; the impact on attrition, as well as the changes in hiring levels and remote working arrangements that we have implemented on our operations, including the health and productivity of management and our employees, and our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls; the impact on our contracts and relationships with our partners; our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks; the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem; and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including how long it takes to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world, which could continue to affect our business. Also, restrictions in affected regions could be extended after the virus has been contained in order to avoid relapses and there may be restrictions on certain travel activity related to whether travelers have been vaccinated. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also heighten many of the other risks identified in this section.\n\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. We had approximately 20,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2021. Our future success and ability to innovate and develop products, services, technologies, and enhancements depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees across our organization, and changes in our workforce may make that more difficult. In addition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support, particularly during peak periods. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry, it is possible our employees may not view employment with us as positively as they did prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have a long-term effect on how and from where people work, the attractiveness of our office environments, and remote working policies, and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in the",

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## \u00b7 Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to 'brick &amp; mortar' retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, the Starbucks Odyssey experience and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer 'work-from-home' policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.",

Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n- Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nFailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\n\n## Risks Related to COVID-19\n\n- Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. Our China market experienced unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets-and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited-any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results.\n\nProlonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.\n\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance (including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices.",

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## General\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, and fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks; comparable store sale percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week.\n\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&amp;A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n- New store openings and store count\n- Comparable store sales\n- Operating margin\n\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\n\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers.\n\nFor the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market.\n\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift.\n\nDespite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.",

The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($1.8 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 2% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,120 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.0 billion). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($368 million).\n\nLicensed stores revenue increased $972 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($922 million) and the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency translation ($81 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million).\n\nOther revenues increased $249 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million).

      "question": "How does the difference in store ownership percentages between HD and SBUX impact their respective financial strategies regarding store closures and lease obligations?",
      "answer": "HD owns 89% of its stores, which allows it to have greater control over long-term store operations and avoid lease-related financial obligations such as lease cancellations or restructuring charges. In contrast, SBUX, which has a significant portion of leased stores (implied from the lease accounting disclosures), incurred $89.5 million and $87.7 million in accelerated amortization and lease costs in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to store closures. This indicates that SBUX is more financially impacted by store closures due to lease liabilities, whereas HD\u2019s high store ownership reduces such exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From HD\u2019s 10-K, we learn that 89% of its stores are owned, implying minimal reliance on leases and reduced exposure to lease-related restructuring costs.",
        "Step 2: From SBUX\u2019s 10-K, we see that the company incurred $89.5 million and $87.7 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to accelerated amortization and lease costs from store closures, indicating a significant leased store portfolio and associated financial impact from closures.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize: The high store ownership by HD reduces its exposure to lease liabilities and restructuring charges upon closure, whereas SBUX\u2019s reliance on leases leads to higher financial costs when stores are closed before lease terms end."

For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets.\n\nAdditionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the COVID-19-related rent concessions we received for stores, primarily in our International segment, were immaterial. During fiscal 2020, we received $27.6 million of COVID-19-related rent concessions for stores in our International segment generally correlating with the temporary period our stores were closed. Consistent with updated guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') in April 2020, we elected to treat COVID-19-related rent concessions as variable rent. Rent concessions were recognized as an offset to our rent expense within store operating expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. See Note 10, Leases, for additional details. Additionally, for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $89.5 million and $87.7 million, respectively, due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to optimize our North America store portfolio and we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets.\n\nWe recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information.\n\n## Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change.",

      "answer": "McDonald's recognizes royalty revenues at the time the underlying sales occur, which means its royalty revenues are immediately impacted by fluctuations in franchisee sales volumes. In contrast, Starbucks reports an increase in royalty revenues as part of licensed stores revenue, but the timing of recognition is not explicitly tied to the underlying sales in the same way. As a result, McDonald's financial performance will reflect changes in franchise sales more directly and contemporaneously, while Starbucks may experience a different pattern of revenue recognition that could smooth or delay the impact of sales fluctuations on reported royalty income.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - McDonald's recognizes royalty revenues based on a percent of sales and recognizes them at the time the underlying sales occur.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - Starbucks reports an increase in royalty revenues but does not specify the timing of recognition, only that it contributed to the $922 million increase in licensed stores revenue.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The difference in revenue recognition timing means McDonald's royalty revenues are more directly tied to current sales performance, while Starbucks' reported royalty revenues may reflect different timing dynamics, affecting how each company's financial performance responds to sales volume changes."

          "chunk_text": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 - refer to the Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected substantially all of these deferrals as of December 31, 2021. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.",

Starbucks' increase in royalty revenue was linked to business improvement following the easing of pandemic restrictions, indicating a similar timing mechanism but with a clear stated impact of external conditions on the revenue stream.

          "chunk_text": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.\n\nSales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 - refer to the Leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. This was elected for the Company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected substantially all of these deferrals as of December 31, 2021. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.",

Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million).

      "answer": "In 2023, GM experienced an increase in freight costs by $0.3 billion, which contributed to higher overall automotive costs. This rise in freight costs was part of a broader set of cost increases that negatively impacted GM's profitability. In contrast, HD included freight costs as part of its inventory valuation, specifically stating that inventory cost includes freight and import costs as a significant component. While GM explicitly reported a $0.3 billion increase in freight costs affecting its cost of sales, HD did not report a specific dollar amount for freight cost changes but instead indicated that freight was embedded in the inventory valuation process, which is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions. Therefore, GM's freight cost increase had a direct, quantifiable negative impact on profitability, whereas HD's impact was indirect and part of ongoing inventory adjustments.",

        "Step 1: From GM's 10-K, freight costs increased by $0.3 billion in 2023, contributing to higher overall automotive costs.",

      "answer": "The increase in AMZN's diluted weighted-average shares from 2019 to 2021 was 21 million shares (from 504 million to 515 million). For MCD, the increase in diluted weighted-average shares over the same period was 0 million shares (as MCD's dilutive effect of share-based compensation remained at 5.5 million shares in both 2019 and 2021). Therefore, the difference in the increase between the two companies is 21 million shares.",

        "Step 1: From AMZN's 10-K filing, extract the diluted weighted-average shares for 2019 (504 million) and 2021 (515 million) to calculate an increase of 11 million shares.",
        "Step 2: From MCD's 10-K filing, extract the dilutive effect of share-based compensation for 2019 (5.5 million shares) and 2021 (5.5 million shares) to determine there is no increase.",
        "Step 3: Calculate the difference in the increase of diluted weighted-average shares between AMZN and MCD from 2019 to 2021: 11 million (AMZN increase) - 0 million (MCD increase) = 11 million."

Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2021-5.5; 2020-5.5; 2019-6.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2021-2.2; 2020-1.8; 2019-0.1.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, Cash and equivalents was $4.7 billion, of which $3.4 billion consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 49",

Net property and equipment decreased $0.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Net property and equipment and the Lease right-of-use asset, net represented approximately 46% and approximately 25%, respectively, of total assets at yearend. Approximately 84% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2021.\n\nThe Company's after-tax ROIC from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time and was 21.5%, 14.9% and 19.2% as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to improved operating results and recovery from the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower average debt balances compared to the prior year. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.\n\n## FINANCING AND MARKET RISK\n\nThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2021 totaled $35.6 billion, compared with $37.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The net decrease in 2021 was due to net repayments of $1.1 billion and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $731 million.\n\n## Debt highlights (1)\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\n## Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value.\n\nWe recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle's estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer's economic incentive to exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.",

      "answer": "The combined value of Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards for NKE and TSLA is $31,208 million. This total is significantly higher than the valuation allowance NKE reported in 2022, which was $19 million. NKE's NOL carry-forwards were $8 million as of May 31, 2022, while TSLA reported $31.2 billion in federal net operating loss carry-forwards as of December 31, 2021.

          "chunk_text": "\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $31.2 billion of federal and $21.6 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2022 for federal and state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect the change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.\n\nOur 2021 net operating loss included corporate income tax deductions related to our CEO's exercise of the remaining stock options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which resulted in a $23.45 billion tax deduction. Such increase in net operating loss is included in our deferred income tax assets, offset by a valuation allowance. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended for deductibility of executive compensation for stock grants after 2017. Therefore, we are not expecting substantial corporate income tax deductions from our CEO's subsequent option exercises.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had research and development tax credits of $738 million and $584 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $186 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.\n\nFederal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an 'ownership change,' as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.",

      "answer": "Nike (NKE) experienced adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in 2022, as a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies reduced the U.S. Dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and increased costs for independent manufacturers purchasing raw materials. Tesla (TSLA), in contrast, reported a $257 million favorable change in Other income (expense), net, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Therefore, while Nike was negatively impacted by FX volatility, Tesla directly benefited by $257 million from favorable FX fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from NKE_10k_2022.pdf - Nike states that a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely affects its sales and earnings, and increases costs for foreign manufacturers.",

Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates including as a result of U.S. policy changes and the Russia and Ukraine conflict that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could also have an effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 12",

      "answer": "NKE faces inventory write-down risks due to challenges in forecasting consumer demand, which could lead to excess inventory that must be sold at discounts or written down entirely, harming profitability and cash flow. TSLA, on the other hand, experiences accounts receivable write-offs related to uncollectible payments from financial institutions, leasing companies, and regulatory credit sales. These differences highlight NKE's vulnerability in managing supply chain and inventory efficiency versus TSLA's exposure to credit risk and payment delays from third-party financing arrangements and regulatory transactions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From NKE's 10-K, inventory write-downs are a risk due to potential forecasting errors, leading to excess inventory and impaired brand image if discounted significantly.",
        "Step 2: TSLA's 10-K discloses that accounts receivable write-offs occur when payments from financing partners, leasing companies, or regulatory credit sales are deemed uncollectible.",
        "Step 3: Comparing both, the financial exposure from inventory write-downs reflects NKE's reliance on accurate demand forecasting and brand-driven retail operations, while TSLA's write-offs highlight its dependence on third-party financing structures and regulatory transactions, revealing distinct operational risks in their business models."

As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.\n\nFurthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor or non-performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.\n\n## Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.\n\nTo meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.\n\n## Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation.\n\nIn addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital offerings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms. In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digital platforms, but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms, consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms, the success of our NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, digital experiences, features, content, services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance.\n\nWe may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and management's attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIf the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected.\n\nMany of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms.

We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period.

      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, Amazon had $6.8 billion in unused letters of credit, while Tesla had $525 million in unused letters of credit. Combined, the total unused letters of credit amount to $7.325 billion. This significant unused credit capacity indicates that both companies maintain access to liquidity buffers that could be utilized for working capital, operational contingencies, or other corporate purposes without immediately drawing on cash reserves or incurring new debt.",
