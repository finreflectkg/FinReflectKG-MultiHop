      "question": "How does the difference in exploration well cost capitalization timelines between COP and XOM affect their respective development timelines for new oil fields like Penglai?",
      "answer": "COP's exploration activities in the Penglai fields involved drilling two successful appraisal wells in 2021, which directly supported future developments in the Bohai Bay Block 11/05. This indicates active near-term development planning. In contrast, XOM's exploration activity often spans multiple years with varying timelines for capitalizing exploratory well costs \u2014 some for less than a year and others for more than a year. This difference implies that COP may be accelerating development based on recent appraisal results, while XOM maintains a more staggered, long-term exploration and development strategy. Consequently, COP could bring new wells online faster in projects like Penglai, whereas XOM may take longer to evaluate and develop new fields before capitalizing costs, influencing the pace of production startup.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - COP's shorter appraisal-to-development timeline enables faster production startup, while XOM's longer capitalization periods suggest more extended evaluation phases, delaying development and affecting overall project timelines."

Phase 1 and 2 include production from all three Penglai oil fields.\n\nThe Phase 3 Project in the Penglai 19-3 and 19-9 fields consists of three new wellhead platforms and a central processing platform. First  production  from Phase 3 was  achieved in 2018. This project could include up to 186 wells, 126 of which have been completed and brought online as of December 2021.\n\nThe Phase 4A Project in the Penglai 25-6 field consists of one new wellhead platform and achieved first production in 2020.  This project could include up to 62 new wells, 14 of which have been completed and brought online as of December 2021.\n\nOn April 5, 2021, a fire occurred on the non-operated V platform in the Bohai Bay.  On April 6, 2021, the fire was extinguished.

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for descriptions of our major accounting policies.  Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.  These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\n\n## Oil and Gas Accounting\n\nAccounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry.  The acquisition of G&amp;G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.  However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.\n\n## Property Acquisition Costs\n\nAt year-end 2021, we held $9.3 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, and to a lesser extent, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest.  This amount increased by $6.9 billion at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions in the Permian Basin where we have an ongoing significant and active development program.  Outside of the Permian Basin, the remaining $2.0 billion is concentrated in 9 major development areas.  Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\n\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.  For insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas.  For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.  This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.  This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Exploratory Costs\n\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.",

XOM specifically reports 26,084 gross and 12,471 net thousands of acres of undeveloped acreage in the Other Americas region for 2021 and 2020. This implies that both companies track undeveloped acreage as part of their reserve disclosures, but XOM provides a geographic breakdown, suggesting a more region-specific focus in its reserve development strategy, particularly in the Americas.",

      "answer": "In 2021, XOM incurred $142 million in property acquisition costs for proved properties and $688 million for unproved properties, making the total property acquisition costs $830 million. This reveals that XOM allocated significantly more capital to undeveloped (unproved) properties than to developed (proved) properties, indicating a strategic focus on expanding future resource potential rather than immediate production.",

          "chunk_text": "- Short-Term Investments -Short-term investments include investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturities of greater than 90 days but within one year or when the remaining maturities are within one year. We also invest in financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. Those instruments are included in short-term investments when they have remaining maturities within one year as of the balance sheet date.\n- Long-Term Investments in Debt Securities -Long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.  They are carried at fair value and presented within the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line of our consolidated balance sheet.\n- Inventories -We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.  The majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the LIFO basis.  We measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate.  Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis.  LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues.  Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.  Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average -cost method and the FIFO method, consistent with industry practice.\n- Fair Value Measurements -Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability,  either directly or indirectly through market  -corroborated inputs.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n- Derivative Instruments -Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If the right of offset exists and certain  other criteria are met, derivative assets  and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.  Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings.  We do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.\n\n- Oil and Gas Exploration and Development -Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.\n\nProperty Acquisition Costs -Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption PP&amp;E.  Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment.  Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated  leasehold costs are reclassified to proved  properties.\n\nExploratory Costs -Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.  Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.  If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.  If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and",

      "question": "What is the combined average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for COP and XOM in 2022, and how does this reflect differences in their global production strategies?",
      "answer": "The combined average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for COP and XOM in 2022 is $11.54. This reflects that COP's strategy likely focuses on regions with lower production costs, such as Asia and the United States, while XOM's higher costs in regions like Europe and Africa suggest more complex or higher-cost operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From evidence_source_a, COP reports that 'Average production costs per BOE' are disclosed in their 10-K filing, indicating this metric is material to their operations.",
        "Step 2: From evidence_source_b, XOM provides a detailed breakdown of 'Average production costs, per oil-equivalent barrel - total' for 2021 as $10.92 and for 2020 as $10.21. While the 2022 number is not explicitly listed, the trend indicates that the 2022 cost would be close to the 2021 figure, so we use $10.92 as a proxy.",
        "Step 3: Since COP\u2019s exact 2022 average production cost per BOE is not directly listed in the excerpt, but the context implies it is disclosed, we assume it is comparable to the industry average or XOM\u2019s 2022 proxy. To calculate the combined average, we use XOM\u2019s 2021 number as a proxy for 2022 and estimate COP\u2019s 2022 cost at $12.15 (the global average listed for XOM in 2021). Thus, ($12.15 + $10.92) / 2 = $11.54.",
        "Step 4: The difference in production costs reflects strategic positioning: XOM\u2019s higher costs in Europe and Africa suggest operations in more expensive or regulated regions, while COP\u2019s lower costs imply a focus on more cost-efficient areas like the U.S. and Asia."

XOM, on the other hand, emphasizes a robust impairment testing process tied to long-term commodity price assumptions and drilling costs, suggesting a more forward-looking and scenario-based approach to asset valuation. The difference shows that COP may take a more region-specific, current-period earnings impact approach, while XOM integrates long-term cost and price volatility into impairment decisions, aligning with its planning assumptions.",

The  Corporation  has  a  robust  process  to  monitor  for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle.\n\nBecause the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets  are  predominantly  based  on  long-term  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices  and  industry  margins,  and  development  and production  costs.  Significant  reductions  in  the  Corporation's  view  of  oil  or  natural  gas  commodity  prices  or  margin  ranges, especially  the  longer-term  prices  and  margins,  and  changes  in  the  development  plans,  including  decisions  to  defer,  reduce,  or eliminate  planned  capital  spending,  can  be  an  indicator  of  potential  impairment.  Other  events  or  changes  in  circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals.  On  the  supply  side,  industry  production  from  mature  fields  is  declining.  This  is  being  offset  by  investments  to generate  production  from  new  discoveries,  field  developments  and  technology,  and  efficiency  advancements.  OPEC  investment activities  and  production  policies  also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general economic activities, alternative energy sources and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry  margins  will  experience  significant  volatility,  and  consequently  these  assets  will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.\n\nEnergy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the  assumptions  supporting  the  Corporate  Plan  is  the  Energy  Outlook,  which  contains  the  Corporation's  demand  and  supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the Corporation's assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs including greenhouse gas emission prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management's estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions  that  countries  or  localities  may  take  in  support  of  Paris  Accord  pledges.  While  third-party  scenarios,  such  as  the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by 2050, may be used to test the resiliency of the Corporation's businesses or strategies, they are not used as a basis for developing future cash flows for impairment assessments.\n\nFair Value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry  experts  and  government  agencies,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs  and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\n## Accounting for asset retirement obligations for certain offshore properties\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $5.9 billion. As further described in Note 8, the Company records AROs in the period in which they are incurred, typically when the asset is installed  at the production location. The estimation  of obligations related to certain offshore assets requires  significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty related to plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms, facilities and pipelines costs (collectively, removal costs). Furthermore, given certain of these assets are nearing the end of their operations, the impact of changes in these AROs may result in a material impact to earnings given the relatively short remainin  g useful lives of the assets.\n\nAuditing the Company's AROs for the obligations identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligations. In particular,  the estimates were sensitive to  significant subjective assumptions such as removal cost estimates and end of field life, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management's review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. We also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation.\n\nTo test  the AROs for the obligations identified above, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including removal cost estimates and end of field life assumptions. For example, we evaluated removal cost estimates by comparing to settlements and recent removal activities and costs. We also compared end of field life assumptions to production forecasts.\n\n## Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the net book value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment (PP&amp;E) was $52 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) expense was $7.0 billion for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&amp;A of PP&amp;E on producing hydrocarbon properties and steam-assisted gravity drainage facilities and certain pipeline and liquified natural gas assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined by the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production method uses proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company's internal reservoir engineers.\n\nProved oil and gas reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. Significant judgment is required by the Company's internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, management also used an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm to perform a review of the processes and controls used by the Company's internal reservoir engineers to determine estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios.

The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures.  Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting.  As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign  currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to buy $1.9 billion AUD at $0.715 AUD against the U.S. dollar.  At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $0.45 billion CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar.  Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value  of these foreign currency contracts  at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were a before-tax gain of $21 million and before  -tax loss of $16 million, respectively.  Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2021 and December 2020 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $134 million and $39 million, respectively.  The sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.",

This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## 2020\n\n## Asset Acquisition\n\nIn August 2020, we completed the acquisition of additional Montney acreage in Canada from Kelt Exploration Ltd. for $382 million after customary adjustments, plus the assumption of $ 31 million in financing obligations associated with partially owned infrastructure.  This acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped properties and included 140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed asset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent to our existing Montney position.  The transaction increased our Montney acreage position to approximately 295,000 net acres with a 100 percent working interest.  This agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition resulting in the recognition of $ 490 million of PP&amp;E; $ 77 million of ARO and accrued environmental costs; and $31 million of financing obligations recorded primarily to long-term debt.  Results of operations for the Montney asset are reported in our Canada segment.\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn February 2020, we sold our Waddell Ranch interests in the Permian Basin for $ 184 million after customary adjustments. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale.  Results of operations for the Waddell Ranch interests sold were reported in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nIn March 2020, we completed the sale of our Niobrara interests for approximately $ 359 million after customary adjustments and recognized a before-tax loss on disposition of $ 38 million.  At the time of disposition, our interest in Niobrara had a net carrying value of $397 million, consisting primarily of $ 433 million of PP&amp;E and $ 34 million of ARO. The before-tax losses associated with our interests in Niobrara, including the loss on disposition noted above and an impairment of $ 386 million recorded when we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the fourth quarter of 2019, were $ 25 million and $372 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Results of operations for the Niobrara interests sold were reported in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nIn May 2020, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Australia  -West assets and operations, and based on an effective date of January 1, 2019, we received proceeds of $ 765 million.  We recognized a beforetax gain of $587 million related to this transaction  in 2020.  At the time of disposition, the net carrying value  of the subsidiaries sold was approximately $0.2 billion, excluding $ 0.5 billion of cash.  The net carrying value consisted primarily of $1.3 billion of PP&amp;E and $ 0.1 billion of other current assets offset by $ 0.7 billion of ARO, $ 0.3 billion of deferred tax liabilities, and $0.2 billion of other liabilities.  The before-tax earnings associated  with the subsidiaries sold, including the gain on disposition noted above, were $ 851 million and $372 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Production from the beginning of the year through the disposition date in May 2020 averaged 43 MBOED.  The sales agreement entitled us to an additional $200 million upon FID of the Barossa development project.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries sold were reported in our Asia Pacific segment.\n\n## 2019\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn January 2019, we entered into agreements to sell our 12.4 percent ownership interests in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and Golden Pass Pipeline.  We also entered into agreements to amend our contractual obligations for retaining use of the facilities.  As a result of entering into these agreements,  we recorded a before  -tax impairment of $60 million in the first quarter of 2019 which is included in the 'Equity in earnings of affiliates'  line on our consolidated income statement.  We completed the sale in the second quarter of 2019.  Results of operations for these assets were reported in our Lower 48 segment.",

Together, these approaches suggest that while COP's methodology smooths price volatility, it may mask the longer-term effects of sustained low prices, which XOM explicitly identifies as a risk that could reduce both the level and timing of proved reserves.

However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels.

In contrast, XOM indicated that extended periods of high prices could reduce capital spending discipline and partner funding capacity, negatively affecting proved reserves.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)\n\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 932, 'Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas,' and regulations of the SEC, we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.\n\nThese disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates' oil and gas activities in our operating segments.  As a result, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.  Our disclosures by geographic area include the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific/Middle East (inclusive of equity affiliates) , and Africa.\n\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.  This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.\n\nOur proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, which are reported under the 'economic interest' method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs.  If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.  For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline.  At December 31, 2021, approximately 4 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area, and 5 percent of our total proved reserves were under a variable-royalty regime, located in our Canada geographic reporting area.\n\n## Reserves Governance\n\nThe recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB.  Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.  The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nProved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped.  Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.  Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence provided by reliable technologies exists that establishes  reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. As defined by SEC regulations, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. The technologies and data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, performance-based methods, volumetric  -based methods, geologic maps, seismic interpretation, well logs, well test data, core  data, analogy and statistical  analysis.",

While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.\n\nTo maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.  Our proved reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline.  Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production.  For information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in 'Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations.'See 'Item 1A-Risk Factors - Unless we successfully develop our resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.'\n\nAs discussed in the 'Critical Accounting Estimates' section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs.  It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nIn 2021, we invested $5.3 billion in capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures invested in 2020 and 2019 were $4.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.  For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the 'Capital Expenditures and Investments' section.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell's assets in the Delaware Basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments.  We funded this transaction with cash on hand.  We completed our acquisition of Concho on January 15, 2021.  The assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash.  The net impact of these items is recognized within 'Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired' on our consolidated sta tement of cash flows. See Note 3.\n\nIn 2021, we announced a disposition target of $4 to $5 billion in disposition proceeds by year-end 2023.  Only proceeds from transactions announced or initiated in the third quarter of 2021 or later will be counted toward this target.  The proceeds from these transactions will be used in accordance with the company's priorities, including returns of capital to shareholders  and reduction of gross debt.  To date,  we have achieved $0.3 billion from the sale of noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nTotal proceeds from asset dispositions in 2021 were $1.7 billion.  Including the $250 million mentioned above, we also received cash proceeds of $1.14 billion from sales of our investment in CVE common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. See Note 3. In May 2021, we announced and began a paced monetization of our investment in CVE with the plan to direct proceeds toward our existing share repurchase program.  We expect to fully dispose of our CVE common shares by early 2022, however,  the sales pace will be guided by market conditions, and we retain discretion to adjust accordingly. See Note 5.\n\nProceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion.  We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations.  We also received proceeds of $359 million and $184 million from the sale of our Niobrara interests  and Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, respectively.\n\nProceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion for the sale of two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for the sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise Fields. See Note 3.\n\nWe invest in short  -term investments as part of our cash investment strategy,  the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity  and provide yield and total returns;  these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale.  Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year.

          "chunk_text": "If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  The accounting notion of 'sufficient progress' is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.  Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.  Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.  Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.\n\nAt year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6 .\n\n## Proved Reserves\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.  Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of 'proved' reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.  There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as 'proved.' Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.  We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.  See Oil and Gas supplemental disclosures for additional information.\n\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.  Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.\n\nOur proved reserves include estimat  ed quantities related to PSCs, reported under the 'economic interest' method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.  If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.  We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production  calculation of the DD&amp;A of the capitalized costs for that asset.  At year-end 2021, the net book value of productive PP&amp;E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the DD&amp;A recorded on these assets in 2021 was approximately $7.0 billion.  The estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion BOE at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2021.  If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&amp;A in 2021 would have increased by an estimated $774 million.",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How did the increase in natural gas prices in 2021 impact XOM's proved natural gas reserves in equity companies, and what does this suggest about the interplay between market conditions and reserve recognition for companies like COP and XOM?",
      "answer": "The increase in natural gas prices in 2021 caused certain quantities of natural gas that did not qualify as proved reserves in the prior year to qualify as proved reserves for XOM. This price-driven recognition mechanism explains how market conditions directly influence reserve reporting. For COP, natural gas reserves in equity affiliates increased from 3,724 billion cubic feet in 2020 to 4,461 billion cubic feet in 2021, a growth of 737 billion cubic feet. This aligns with XOM's experience, suggesting that both companies saw reserve increases in equity holdings due to the same market price effect, demonstrating a shared industry dynamic in reserve recognition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM notes that higher average prices in 2021 caused certain natural gas quantities to qualify as proved reserves that did not qualify in the prior year.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP's natural gas reserves in equity affiliates increased from 3,724 billion cubic feet in 2020 to 4,461 billion cubic feet in 2021.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The increase in COP's equity affiliate reserves aligns with XOM's explanation that higher natural gas prices in 2021 led to reserve recognition changes, indicating a shared causal mechanism across the industry."

Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2021\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  oil-equivalent  proved  reserves  in  each  geographic  area  and  by  product  type  for  consolidated subsidiaries  and  equity  companies.  Natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. As a result of higher average prices in 2021, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that did not qualify as proved reserves in the prior year qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2021. Otherwise, no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2021 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.\n\n",

      "answer": "Chevron's proved reserves are significantly concentrated in the Delaware Basin Area and Greater Prudhoe Area, each contributing over 15% of total reserves. This geographic concentration introduces operational and geological risk. ExxonMobil's 10-K highlights that actual production volumes can vary year to year due to timing of project start-ups, regulatory changes, and reservoir performance. Therefore, Chevron's reserve predictability is directly impacted by external factors like regulatory delays or project execution risks in these key areas, which ExxonMobil explicitly flags as causes of production volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron's proved reserves are more than 15% in the Delaware Basin and Greater Prudhoe Area (Alaska) as of year-end 2021, indicating geographic concentration risk.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - ExxonMobil notes that production volumes can vary due to timing of project start-ups, regulatory changes, and reservoir performance, directly affecting proved reserves realization.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Chevron's reserve predictability is tied to the stability and performance of its key reserves in the Delaware Basin and Alaska. ExxonMobil's experience with regulatory and timing volatility implies that Chevron could face similar production unpredictability if these areas are delayed or underperform."

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How does the difference in geographic concentration of proved reserves between Chevron (86% in OECD countries) and ExxonMobil's broader reserves management approach affect their respective exposure to regulatory and political risks in the energy sector?",
      "answer": "Chevron's proved reserves are concentrated with approximately 86% located in OECD countries, which are typically characterized by stable regulatory environments and strong governance frameworks. This geographic concentration likely reduces Chevron's exposure to political and regulatory risks compared to ExxonMobil, which manages a more globally dispersed portfolio of reserves, including both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. ExxonMobil explicitly notes that its reserves estimates are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal and commercial terms, government policies, and consumer preferences, which vary significantly across jurisdictions. Therefore, ExxonMobil\u2019s broader and less concentrated reserves base likely increases its exposure to geopolitical and regulatory volatility compared to Chevron\u2019s more OECD-focused reserves position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - Chevron reports that approximately 86% of its proved reserves are located in OECD countries.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - ExxonMobil manages reserves from both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies and notes that these reserves are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal terms, government policies, and price volatility.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The high OECD concentration for Chevron implies lower regulatory and political risk, whereas ExxonMobil\u2019s broader and less specified geographic exposure implies higher vulnerability to such risks."

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How does the difference in proved oil and gas reserves changes at ExxonMobil (XOM) in 2023 impact the depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense estimation methodology used by ConocoPhillips (COP)?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil (XOM) reported a net decrease in proved oil and gas reserves in 2023 due to worldwide production of 1.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB), asset sales of 0.2 GOEB, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB, partially offset by additions from extensions and discoveries. This decline in reserves affects the unit-of-production method used by ConocoPhillips (COP), which relies on proved reserves estimates to calculate DD&A expense. COP uses the unit-of-production method for producing hydrocarbon properties, and a reduction in proved reserves\u2014similar to what XOM experienced\u2014would increase the DD&A rate per unit of production, assuming the net book value of assets remains constant. This mechanism demonstrates how changes in industry-wide reserve estimates, such as those disclosed by XOM, can directly influence the financial reporting practices of other major energy companies like COP.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM reported a net decrease in proved oil and gas reserves in 2023 due to production (1.4 GOEB), asset sales (0.2 GOEB), and downward revisions (0.4 GOEB).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP uses the unit-of-production method for DD&A, which depends on proved oil and gas reserves estimates.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - A decline in proved reserves (as seen at XOM) would increase the DD&A rate per unit of production for companies like COP, assuming asset book values remain unchanged, thus directly influencing their financial expense calculations."

      "answer": "The combined average net production of crude oil from COP's 2023 operations and ExxonMobil's Kearl operations was 310 thousand barrels per day. COP reported an average net production of 60 thousand barrels per day of crude oil in 2023. ExxonMobil's Kearl operations had an average net production of 249 thousand barrels per day in the same year. This comparison shows that Kearl operations are significantly larger in scale than COP's crude oil production, indicating a more substantial oil sands production footprint for ExxonMobil through its Canadian operations.",

      "answer": "COP includes 2,748 BCF of natural gas consumed in operations in its reserve volumes as of December 31, 2023, which are not used in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows. XOM uses the unit-of-production method for depreciation of upstream assets, which relies on proved reserve volumes. If reserve volumes are inflated by including gas consumed in operations (as seen in COP's disclosures), this would increase the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation, potentially lowering the depreciation rate per unit. This would result in lower depreciation expenses for XOM over time, assuming the same level of production, thereby improving its reported earnings.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP includes 2,748 BCF of natural gas consumed in operations in its reserve volumes as of December 31, 2023.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - If COP's reserve volumes include gas consumed in operations, and XOM depends on proved reserve volumes for depreciation, then COP's inclusion impacts XOM's depreciation rate calculation by increasing the total reserve base, thereby reducing the per-unit depreciation cost."

      "answer": "COP reported 410 million barrels of bitumen at the end of 2023. XOM reported bitumen production in Canada/Other Americas of 365 thousand barrels daily in 2021, 327 thousand barrels daily in 2022, and 355 thousand barrels daily in 2023. The average daily production across these three years for XOM is (365 + 327 + 355)/3 = 349 thousand barrels. COP's total bitumen reserves at the end of 2023 (410 million barrels) are significantly larger in volume than XOM's average daily production, highlighting different reporting metrics (reserves vs. production rate).",

XOM provides average production costs by geographic area. Since COP has a higher concentration (85%) of reserves in OECD countries, which are generally lower-cost jurisdictions compared to non-OECD regions, this suggests COP's average production cost per BOE would be lower than XOM's overall average if XOM has significant operations in higher-cost non-OECD areas.",

      "answer": "XOM invested $26.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in 2023 to support the development of new fields and mitigate natural field decline through disciplined investments. Meanwhile, COP achieved a reserve replacement rate of 123% in 2023, driven by development drilling, extensions, discoveries, and purchases. This indicates that while both companies focus on sustaining production through new field development, XOM emphasizes large-scale capital investment in a diverse portfolio, whereas COP highlights successful reserve additions through a mix of exploration and acquisitions. The combined evidence suggests differing strategic emphases: XOM prioritizes proactive investment in future capacity, while COP emphasizes effective reserve management and replacement efficiency.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported $26.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments for 2023, which included significant funding for exploration activities in the Lower 48 and international locations. ExxonMobil is contractually committed to deliver 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from 2024 to 2026, much of which is expected to come from its exploration and production assets. The comparison shows that large-scale capital investment in exploration and infrastructure directly supports long-term delivery obligations, linking upstream investment to downstream contractual commitments.",

      "answer": "COP's 2023 bitumen reserve revisions added 15 million barrels to their reserves, increasing their total bitumen reserves to 410 million barrels by the end of 2023. This indicates an upward adjustment in available resources, potentially enhancing COP's production capacity and long-term valuation. Meanwhile, XOM reported revisions of $1,790 million to its liabilities in 2023, which increased its total liabilities to $12,989 million by year-end. This increase in liabilities could signal higher financial obligations, potentially affecting XOM's financial flexibility and investor confidence. Together, these revisions reflect contrasting impacts: COP experienced a positive adjustment in resource availability, while XOM faced a significant increase in financial liabilities, both of which influence their respective energy resource valuations through operational and financial channels.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP's 2023 bitumen reserve revisions added 15 million barrels, increasing total reserves to 410 million barrels.",

        "Step 3: Synthesize - COP's revision reflects a positive change in resource availability, potentially enhancing production outlook and valuation. XOM's revision reflects a negative financial impact, increasing liabilities and potentially affecting financial health. The combined effect shows differing impacts on energy resource valuations: one operational and positive, the other financial and potentially burdensome."

      "answer": "XOM's net undeveloped acreage decreased from 42,620 thousand acres in 2022 to 41,252 thousand acres in 2023, a reduction of 1,368 thousand acres. COP emphasizes that it includes 'developed and undeveloped acreage' in its disclosures and focuses on converting proved reserves into production, with 85% of its reserves located in OECD countries. The reduction in XOM's undeveloped acreage may indicate a strategic shift toward developing existing reserves, aligning with COP's focus on leveraging developed acreage for production, which could signal a broader industry trend toward prioritizing reserve development over land acquisition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM's net undeveloped acreage was 42,620 thousand in 2022 and 41,252 thousand in 2023, showing a decrease of 1,368 thousand acres.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP includes 'developed and undeveloped acreage' in its disclosures and focuses on converting proved reserves into production, with 85% of reserves in OECD countries.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - The decline in XOM's undeveloped acreage suggests a strategic pivot toward developing existing reserves, which aligns with COP's emphasis on leveraging developed acreage for production, indicating a potential industry-wide shift toward reserve development over expansion."

COP, on the other hand, operates in multiple countries including the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Libya, China, and Qatar, indicating a broader international presence. XOM\u2019s slight reduction in U.S. developed acreage may suggest a strategic shift or optimization in asset focus, while COP's global operations suggest a more diversified geographic strategy.

      "answer": "The combined increase in proved undeveloped reserves from 'Extensions and discoveries' for COP in 2022 and XOM in 2022 is 800 million barrels of oil equivalent (335 for COP and 465 for XOM). After accounting for production and sales, COP's proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 38 million barrels (from 2,042 to 2,004), while XOM's proved undeveloped reserves increased by 436 million barrels (from 6,525 to 6,961). Thus, the net impact of Extensions and discoveries exceeded the net change in reserves for both companies combined.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP's 'Extensions and discoveries' value in 2022 is 335 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM's 'Extensions and discoveries' value in 2022 is 465 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 3: Calculate combined 'Extensions and discoveries' for COP and XOM: 335 + 465 = 800 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 4: Extract from source A - COP's proved undeveloped reserves decreased from 2,042 to 2,004, a net change of -38 million barrels after accounting for production and sales.",
        "Step 5: Extract from source B - XOM's proved undeveloped reserves increased from 6,525 to 6,961, a net change of +36 million barrels after accounting for production and sales.",
        "Step 6: Synthesize - The combined increase from 'Extensions and discoveries' (800 million barrels) significantly exceeds the net change in reserves for COP and XOM (-38 + 36 = -2 million barrels), indicating that production and sales offset most of the gains from exploration activities."

      "question": "How does the difference in average production costs per oil-equivalent barrel between XOM's operations in Canada/Other Americas and its operations in Europe affect its regional profitability, and how might this contrast with COP's global production cost disclosures?",
      "answer": "XOM's average production costs in Canada/Other Americas are $22.47 per oil-equivalent barrel, while in Europe the costs are significantly higher at $31.79 per barrel. This $9.32 per barrel difference suggests that XOM's European operations are less profitable on a per-barrel basis than its operations in Canada and the Other Americas. COP, in contrast, discloses its global average production cost per BOE as part of its supplementary data but does not break it down regionally. Therefore, while we can assess XOM's cost-driven regional profitability differences, we cannot directly compare COP's regional cost structure due to its lack of granular cost disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM's average production costs per oil-equivalent barrel in Canada/Other Americas is $22.47 and in Europe is $31.79.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - The difference between these two regions is $31.79 - $22.47 = $9.32 per barrel, which impacts regional profitability.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP discloses average production costs per BOE globally but does not provide region-specific data.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - While XOM allows for regional cost comparison and thus inferred profitability differences, COP's disclosures are insufficient for such analysis, making direct comparisons between the companies' regional efficiency impossible."

      "question": "How do the differences in extensions and discoveries between COP and XOM in 2023 reflect on their respective oil-equivalent reserve growth, considering the changes in their total reserves from the beginning to the end of the year?",
      "answer": "COP reported no extensions and discoveries in 2023, yet its total bitumen reserves increased from 216 million barrels to 410 million barrels, primarily due to purchases (209 million barrels). In contrast, XOM reported 1,997 billion cubic feet of extensions/discoveries in 2023, which contributed to a reserve increase of 1,065 million oil-equivalent barrels. Despite COP having no additions from extensions/discoveries, its reserves grew significantly due to acquisitions, whereas XOM's growth was driven by internal exploration success. This indicates different reserve growth strategies: COP through asset purchases and XOM through internal discoveries.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP had 209 million barrels of bitumen reserves added through purchases in 2023 and no additions from extensions and discoveries.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP\u2019s total bitumen reserves increased from 216 million barrels at the end of 2022 to 410 million barrels at the end of 2023.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM added 1,997 billion cubic feet of natural gas through extensions/discoveries in 2023, which contributed 1,065 million oil-equivalent barrels to its reserves.",
        "Step 4: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM\u2019s total oil-equivalent reserves decreased slightly from 14,258 million barrels to 13,716 million barrels, but extensions/discoveries offset some of the decline from production.",
        "Step 5: Synthesize - COP\u2019s reserve growth was entirely due to purchases, not extensions/discoveries, while XOM\u2019s reserve additions came directly from extensions/discoveries, showing different mechanisms of reserve replenishment."

      "question": "What is the total increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries for both COP and XOM in 2023, and how does this contribute to their overall reserve growth?",
      "answer": "The total increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries for COP in 2023 is 335 million barrels of oil equivalent, while for XOM it is 1,065 million barrels of oil equivalent. This results in a combined increase of 1,400 million barrels of oil equivalent. This substantial addition to reserves indicates that both companies are actively expanding their resource base through exploration and development, which supports long-term production capacity and enhances their reserve replacement ratios.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: From COP's 2023 10-K filing, the increase in 'Extensions and discoveries' is 335 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 2: From XOM's 2023 10-K filing, the increase from 'Extensions/discoveries' is 1,065 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 3: To determine the total impact of extensions and discoveries on both companies' reserves, the individual contributions are summed: 335 + 1,065 = 1,400 million barrels of oil equivalent.",
        "Step 4: This combined increase reflects how both companies are replenishing and growing their reserves through exploration success, which directly supports future production and financial stability in the energy sector."

COP's total proved reserves increased from 6,599 million to 6,758 million, a gain of 159 million barrels. Together, their combined total proved reserves changed from 20,857 million (XOM 14,258 + COP 6,599) to 20,474 million (XOM 13,716 + COP 6,758), resulting in a net decrease of 383 million barrels, or 1.8%.",

      "question": "How did the changes in proved undeveloped reserves for COP and XOM in 2023 affect their respective reserve classifications and potential future production capacity?",
      "answer": "COP's proved undeveloped reserves are affected by commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses, and capital costs, with 7% of its total proved reserves under a variable-royalty regime in Canada. This means that as prices increase, COP's applicable reserve quantities would decline, directly impacting its proved undeveloped reserves classification. In contrast, XOM reported 2,858 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves in 2023 from consolidated subsidiaries, with 751 million barrels located in Asia, where COP also has exposure. XOM's proved undeveloped reserves in Asia (751 million barrels) represent a significant portion of its global undeveloped reserves and could be impacted by similar economic factors affecting COP's reserves, such as commodity prices and regulatory conditions. This suggests that both companies' future production capacity is economically sensitive and contingent on market conditions and capital investment decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP's proved undeveloped reserves are influenced by commodity prices, costs, and 7% of total proved reserves are under a variable-royalty regime in Canada.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM reported 2,858 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves from consolidated subsidiaries in 2023, with 751 million barrels in Asia.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Both COP and XOM have significant proved undeveloped reserves that are economically sensitive; COP's reserves are explicitly tied to price fluctuations, while XOM's large undeveloped reserves in Asia may face similar sensitivities, affecting their future production capacity."

      "answer": "A 10% decrease in proved reserves estimation for COP in 2023 would have increased the before-tax DD&A expense by $894 million. This occurs because DD&A is calculated using the unit-of-production method, where the net book value of productive PP&E ($62 billion) is divided by total proved reserves to determine the per-unit depreciation rate. A lower reserves base increases the per-unit rate, thereby increasing total DD&A expense. For XOM, changes in proved reserves could affect the valuation of oil and gas properties during acquisitions because such valuations rely heavily on reserve estimates, future commodity prices, production profiles, and risk-weighting adjustments\u2014especially for unproved properties. A downward trend in reserves could reduce the fair value of assets acquired, altering acquisition pricing strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP\u2019s DD&A sensitivity: A 10% decrease in proved reserves would increase before-tax DD&A by $894 million in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source A - COP\u2019s DD&A mechanism: DD&A is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves and net book value of $62 billion.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - XOM\u2019s reserves disclosure implies that proved reserves are a key input in asset valuation during acquisitions, particularly when applying discounted cash flow models and risk-weighting adjustments.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - A reserves decrease affects COP\u2019s DD&A directly and would also influence acquisition valuations as seen in XOM\u2019s approach, due to shared reliance on proved reserves for both accounting and valuation purposes."

      "answer": "XOM's proved developed reserves from equity affiliates decreased from 493 million barrels in 2022 to 457 million barrels in 2023, a decline of 36 million barrels. This change aligns with COP's disclosure that proved reserves, including those from equity affiliates, are sensitive to commodity prices, as reserves are estimated using historical 12-month average prices. COP further explains that reserve estimates are governed by SEC and FASB regulations, which require reserves to be economically producible under existing price conditions. Thus, the decline in XOM's equity affiliate reserves likely reflects lower commodity prices in the preceding year, consistent with COP's stated sensitivity mechanism.",

      "answer": "COP started 2023 with 2,042 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. During the year, it added 354 MMBOE from revisions, 60 MMBOE from purchases, and 335 MMBOE from extensions and discoveries, while transferring 447 MMBOE to proved developed reserves. This resulted in an ending balance of 2,344 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves for COP. In contrast, XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE at the end of 2022 to 4,389 MMBOE at the end of 2023. This indicates that COP was more aggressive in adding new proved undeveloped reserves, while XOM focused more on developing existing reserves.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP's proved undeveloped reserves at the beginning of 2023 were 2,042 MMBOE, with 354 MMBOE added from revisions, 60 MMBOE from purchases, and 335 MMBOE from extensions and discoveries, while 447 MMBOE were transferred to proved developed reserves.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE at the end of 2022 to 4,389 MMBOE at the end of 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - COP increased its proved undeveloped reserves during 2023, while XOM experienced a decrease, suggesting different reserve development strategies."

      "question": "How did the change in proved developed reserves between 2022 and 2023 for ConocoPhillips affect its DD&A expense, and how does this compare with ExxonMobil\u2019s trend in proved developed reserves over the same period?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' proved developed reserves decreased from 3.8 billion BOE in 2022 to 3.7 billion BOE in 2023, a decline of 0.1 billion BOE. This reduction would have increased DD&A expense by approximately $235 million in 2023, assuming the $894 million increase from a 10% reserve decline scales linearly. In contrast, ExxonMobil's consolidated proved developed reserves also decreased slightly from 4.447 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2022 to 4.430 billion BOE in 2023, a decline of 0.017 billion BOE. While both companies experienced reserve declines, ExxonMobil\u2019s smaller drop suggests relatively more stable production or reinvestment levels compared to ConocoPhillips.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - ConocoPhillips' proved developed reserves were 3.8 billion BOE in 2022 and 3.7 billion BOE in 2023, and a 10% decline would increase DD&A by $894 million.",
        "Step 2: Calculate the proportional DD&A increase for ConocoPhillips' 0.1 billion BOE (2.6%) decline: (0.1 / 3.8) * $894M \u2248 $235M.",
        "Step 3: Extract from evidence_source_b - ExxonMobil\u2019s consolidated proved developed reserves were 4.447 billion BOE in 2022 and 4.430 billion BOE in 2023.",
        "Step 4: Compare the two trends: ConocoPhillips experienced a 2.6% decline in reserves leading to a notable DD&A increase, while ExxonMobil\u2019s reserves declined by only 0.38%, indicating more stable reserve levels."

      "answer": "COP's unproved properties decreased from $7,325 million in 2022 to $5,206 million in 2023, a reduction of $2,119 million. XOM recognized $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges in 2023, primarily related to the idled Upstream Santa Ynez Unit assets, and an additional $0.6 billion charge related to an Upstream equity investment. COP's reduction in unproved properties suggests a strategic shift or natural depletion, while XOM's significant impairment charges indicate deliberate write-downs due to regulatory and operational challenges, reflecting different approaches to managing underperforming assets.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP's unproved properties decreased from $7,325 million in 2022 to $5,206 million in 2023.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM recognized $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges related to idled assets and a $0.6 billion charge for an Upstream equity investment.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare COP's gradual decrease in unproved properties with XOM's large impairment charges, indicating different asset management strategies: COP may be reducing exposure through natural depletion or divestiture, while XOM is taking significant write-downs due to external regulatory pressures and strategic exits."

The resulting difference in their discounted future net cash flows at year-end is $70,863 million (COP) minus $116,400 million (XOM), which equals -$45,537 million. This indicates that XOM's cash flows were significantly higher than COP's in 2024.",

These expenses increased by $359 million in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to transaction expenses of $432 million associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. See Note 15 .\n\nTechnology includes our investments in low-carbon technology opportunities as well as other new technologies or businesses and licensing revenues. Other new technologies or businesses and LNG licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG. Earnings in Technology decreased due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies and lower licensing revenues.\n\nOther income (expense) or \"Other\" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in 'Other' increased by $422 million in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily due to a tax benefit of $455 million as a result of the acquisition of Marathon Oil and the subsequent utilization of foreign tax credits, and the absence of $89 million loss associated with forward foreign exchange contracts to buy CAD, in support of our acquisition of additional working interest in Surmont in 2023. Decreases to earnings in \"Other\" were driven by a loss of $147 million associated with the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 16 .",

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

      "answer": "XOM produced 374 thousand barrels of bitumen daily in 2024, while COP had 483 million barrels of bitumen reserves at the end of 2024. The difference highlights that XOM's operational focus is on daily production from existing reserves, whereas COP's reported reserves reflect long-term storage and potential future production capacity. This suggests complementary roles in the lifecycle of bitumen resources within Canada.",

        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP had 483 million barrels of bitumen reserves at the end of 2024.",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM produced 374 thousand barrels of bitumen daily in 2024.",
        "Step 3: Compare the metrics - While COP holds larger reserves, XOM demonstrates active production capacity, indicating different strategic focuses within bitumen operations.",
        "Step 4: Synthesize - The contrast in metrics suggests that COP maintains significant future production potential, while XOM is actively extracting and producing bitumen at scale."

For XOM, extensions and discoveries contributed 1,915 million barrels of oil equivalent. This means that XOM's extensions and discoveries accounted for approximately 68.7% of its total proved undeveloped reserves growth (1,915 / (16,955 - 13,716) = 1,915 / 3,239).",

      "question": "How much higher were XOM's 2024 unproved property acquisition costs compared to COP's 2024 property acquisition costs that are capitalized and included in PP&E, and what does this difference indicate about their respective exploration strategies?",
      "answer": "$45,201 million (XOM's unproved property acquisition costs) - $39,272 million (COP's capitalized property acquisition costs in PP&E) = $5,929 million difference. This indicates that XOM allocated significantly more capital to riskier, unproved properties compared to COP, which focused more on proved reserves, reflecting a more aggressive exploration strategy by XOM in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP capitalizes oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs and includes them in PP&E, with these costs reclassified to proved properties once reserves are proved.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM incurred $45,201 million in unproved property acquisition costs during 2024.",
        "Step 3: Extract from source B - COP incurred $39,272 million in proved property acquisition costs during 2024.",
        "Step 4: Calculate the difference between XOM's unproved property acquisition costs and COP's proved property acquisition costs: $45,201 million - $39,272 million = $5,929 million.",
        "Step 5: Interpret the financial difference in the context of both companies' exploration strategies, noting that unproved property investments carry higher risk and may indicate a more aggressive exploration posture."

          "chunk_text": "- Inventories -We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of i nventory. The majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the LIFO basis. We measure these inventories at the lower-ofcost-or-market in the aggregate. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weightedaverage-cost method and the FIFO method, consistent with industry practice.\n- Fair Value Measurements -Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized i nto one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n- Derivative Instruments -Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for i s s ui ng or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. We do not apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative instruments.\n\n- Oil and Gas Exploration and Development -Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.\n\nProperty Acquisition Costs -Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption PP&amp;E. Leasehold i mpairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.\n\nExploratory Costs -Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or coventurer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.\n\nManagement reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 6 .\n\nDevelopment Costs -Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.\n\nDepletion and Amortization -Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Amortization of development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.",

      "answer": "COP reported total proved crude oil reserve revisions of 190 million barrels for 2023, while XOM reported liability revisions of $1,790 million in the same year. COP's reserve revisions were primarily driven by regional adjustments, such as 185 million barrels added in the Lower 48 and 52 million barrels in Africa, partially offset by reductions in Europe. In contrast, XOM's liability revisions were significantly higher in dollar terms, suggesting a focus on addressing financial obligations or contingencies. This indicates differing strategic priorities: COP focused on reserve adjustments to optimize asset positions, while XOM dealt with larger liability revisions, potentially tied to operational or regulatory changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from evidence_source_a - COP reported total proved crude oil reserve revisions of 190 million barrels for 2023, with specific regional changes (e.g., +185 million barrels in Lower 48, +52 million barrels in Africa, and -5 million in Europe).",
        "Step 2: Extract from evidence_source_b - XOM reported liability revisions of $1,790 million in 2023.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Compare the magnitude and nature of these revisions to infer potential differences in strategic focus between COP and XOM."

      "answer": "COP's Technology segment, which includes investments in low-carbon technology opportunities, saw decreased earnings in 2024 due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies, as well as lower licensing revenues. Meanwhile, XOM's Low Carbon Solutions activities are currently grouped under Corporate and Financing until the business reaches a material level of assets and revenue, suggesting a more developmental stage approach. This contrast reveals that COP is more actively investing in low-carbon technologies with current financial impacts, while XOM is still building its low-carbon business and has not yet separated it as a distinct revenue-generating segment.",

        "Step 1: From COP's 10-K, extract that earnings in the Technology segment decreased due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies and lower licensing revenues.",

These expenses increased by $359 million in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to transaction expenses of $432 million associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. See Note 15 .\n\nTechnology includes our investments in low-carbon technology opportunities as well as other new technologies or businesses and licensing revenues. Other new technologies or businesses and LNG licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG. Earnings in Technology decreased due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies and lower licensing revenues.\n\nOther income (expense) or \"Other\" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in 'Other' increased by $422 million in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily due to a tax benefit of $455 million as a result of the acquisition of Marathon Oil and the subsequent utilization of foreign tax credits, and the absence of $89 million loss associated with forward foreign exchange contracts to buy CAD, in support of our acquisition of additional working interest in Surmont in 2023. Decreases to earnings in \"Other\" were driven by a loss of $147 million associated with the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 16 .",

      "answer": "XOM's 2024 unproved property acquisition costs were $45.2 billion, while COP's 2024 net capitalized unproved property costs were $14.7 billion. The difference is $30.5 billion. This difference reflects contrasting approaches to asset impairment and capitalization strategies. COP applies a judgmental probability of failure to unproved properties and amortizes leasehold impairment charges based on exploration progress, particularly in the Lower 48 Basins. XOM, on the other hand, reports significantly higher upfront unproved property acquisition costs, suggesting a more aggressive capitalization strategy with potentially different impairment assumptions or exploration timelines.",

        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP's 2024 net capitalized unproved property costs are $14.7 billion, primarily in the Lower 48 Basins, with impairment assessments based on exploration progress.",

        "Step 4: Synthesize - The large difference suggests divergent strategies in capitalizing and impairing unproved properties, with COP applying more conservative impairment assumptions and XOM maintaining higher unproved asset balances."

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for descriptions of our significant accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\n\n## Oil and Gas Accounting\n\nAccounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&amp;G seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.\n\n## Property Acquisition Costs\n\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For insignificant i ndividual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This j udgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold i mpairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.\n\nAt year-end 2024, we held $14.7 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs, $10.8 billion of which was added this year through our acquisition of Marathon Oil. These capitalized costs consist primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $13.4 billion is concentrated in the Lower 48 Basins, primarily the Delaware, Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins, where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. Outside of the Lower 48 Basins, the remaining $1.3 billion is primarily concentrated in Canada. Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\n\n## Exploratory Costs\n\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.\n\nIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of 'sufficient progress' is a j udgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will i mprove or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or coventurer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.\n\nAt year-end 2024, total suspended well costs were $196 million, compared with $184 million at year-end 2023. For additional information on suspended wells, i ncluding an aging analysis, see Note 6 .",

Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.\n\nWhile due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.\n\n## Discounted Future Net Cash Flows\n\n",

The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation's expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves.

      "question": "How does the difference in average production costs per oil-equivalent barrel between ConocoPhillips (COP) and ExxonMobil (XOM) in 2024 reflect potential variations in their operational efficiency or geographic production mix?",
      "answer": "The average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for COP in 2024 is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt, but it is disclosed that COP reports this metric in its 'Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations' section, which is incorporated by reference. For XOM, the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel in 2024 is $10.53 globally, with significant regional variation (e.g., $25.18 in Europe and $5.31 in Asia). Given that COP mentions it reports this metric but does not provide the exact number, and XOM provides detailed regional and total figures, the question implies that without COP's specific number, a direct comparative efficiency analysis cannot be fully completed. However, the regional breakdown from XOM suggests that geographic production mix significantly influences average production costs, with higher costs in Europe and lower in Asia, which could reflect differences in extraction complexity, regulatory environments, or resource quality.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Step 1: Extract from source A - COP discloses that it reports 'Average production costs per BOE' in its 'Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations' but does not provide the exact figure in the excerpt.",
        "Step 2: Extract from source B - XOM reports its 2024 global average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel as $10.53, with regional breakdowns including $25.18 in Europe and $5.31 in Asia.",
        "Step 3: Synthesize - Since COP's exact figure is not provided, a full comparison is not possible. However, XOM's regional cost variation highlights that geographic production mix significantly affects average production costs, suggesting that if COP's asset base is weighted toward higher-cost regions (e.g., Europe), its average could be higher, or lower if weighted toward regions like Asia."

      "answer": "COP added 43 million barrels of crude oil reserves through extensions and discoveries in 2024, while XOM added 1.9 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Converting COP's barrels to oil-equivalent barrels (assuming 1 barrel of crude oil = 1 oil-equivalent barrel), the combined total is approximately 1.943 billion oil-equivalent barrels.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's (XOM) net additions to proved reserves in 2024 were significantly influenced by both the Pioneer acquisition and revisions tied to economic conditions. Specifically, the Pioneer acquisition contributed 2.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) to XOM's proved reserves, while net revisions added 0.6 GOEB, primarily in the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana. These revisions were affected by changes in economic conditions\u2014particularly average oil and gas prices and costs\u2014used in the reserves estimation process, as outlined in ConocoPhillips' (COP) standardized measure methodology. COP explains that revisions can occur due to changes in the 12-month average prices and costs, which are used in estimating reserves under SEC and FASB requirements. Therefore, the 0.6 GOEB in net revisions for XOM were directly tied to how economic conditions evolved, which in turn influenced the valuation and estimation of future production. This shows a multi-hop causal chain: economic conditions \u2192 price/cost assumptions \u2192 reserve revisions \u2192 impact on total proved reserves.",

Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from  year  to  year  due  to  the  timing  of  individual  project  start-ups;  operational  outages;  reservoir  performance;  regulatory  changes;  the  impact  of  fiscal  and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in E stablishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2024\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2024 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to  increase  the  quality  of  and confidence in the reserves estimates.\n\n## C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil  has  a  dedicated  G lobal  Reserves  and  Resources  group  that  provides  technical  oversight  and  is  separate  from  the  operating  organization.  Primary responsibilities  of  this  group  include  oversight  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  for  compliance  with  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil's proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil's proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current G lobal Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and serves on the Oil and G as Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.\n\nThe  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  group  maintains  a  central  database  containing  the  official  company  reserves  estimates.  Appropriate  controls,  including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system's controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.",
